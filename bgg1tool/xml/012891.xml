   <description>Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies! Or be Frederick the Great and struggle for survival with a mixture of courageous willpower, sudden inspiration and stoic patience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It is the summer of 1756. On the eve of the Seven Years War, half of Europe has formed an alliance. Frederick the Great is in deep sorrow: Is the annihilation of Prussia planned? Is it Prussia's defeat or is it Prussia's glory?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All against one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Histogame and Richard Siv_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;l present Friedrich as a novel concept uniting the fascination of board and card games. Accurately based on history while maintaining a slim set of rules, Friedrich offers wide open spaces for chess-like moves and great depth for decision making. Taken into Frederick's era, you will reflect on tactical finesses, smile about interspersed anecdotes, and be perplexed at how often you are not able to count to three..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: A common misconception is that Friedrich has player elimination based on the cards of fate making countries leave the game. The game does not have player elimination; it has country elimination, and a player could end up controlling fewer countries than they started with, but players are never eliminated by the cards of fate._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Friedrich FAQ_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Details on the Jubil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;umsedition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2011 Histogame released a slightly revised version of Friedrich, dubbed the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Jubil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;umsedition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Anniversay Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in honor of Friedrich's 300th birthday. Designer Richard Siv_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;l notes the following differences between this edition and earlier ones:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     New cover art._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Four color images for the patterns of the cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Small rearrangements of cities on the map, such as Falkenau (in northwestern Austria) moving into the spades sector and Gollnow (close to Stettin) getting a diamonds-city neighbor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Minor adjustment of some fate cards to clarify the wording._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     More details: on this webpage_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Brand New and In Shrink-Wrap!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 5 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>1st edition (board errata corrected with stickers) + 2nd edition upgrade kits (multi-lingual cards and hardboard occupation markers). Game has been played only once, practically in like-new condition.
UPDATE: I forgot about this completely - the game box contains the designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s signature. On its own it would be an welcome addition, but it also says _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Have fun with Friedrich in Korea_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Well, helps if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in Korea, I guess. It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have my name on it ;)

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 451)
It is the summer of 1756. Frederick the Great faces the grim fact that half of Europe has formed an alliance. He is in deep sorrow: It seems to him that their aim is the annihilation of Prussia. 
Therefore he makes a preemptive strike against Saxony, which surrenders weeks later. But this is only the first chapter in what would become known as the Seven Years War! Prussia is completely encircled by her enemies, the biggest continental powers in Europe. England and Hanover are her only allies. – For Prussia, the situation is easy to sum up: To be or not to be. 
Soon the Prussian House is burning. France has conquered Northern Germany. Austria has invaded Silesia. Russian hordes are crossing the River Oder, and Berlin is a mere five days march away! 
Frederick is relentless. He desperately rushes from crisis to crisis within his strategic triangle, managing to check one enemy only as another takes advantage of his absence to advance. After six long years of struggle, Prussia seems doomed to fall . . . 
Frederick is saved by a miracle. The Russian Tsarina Elisabeth dies, and her successor has an almost infinite adoration for Frederick, and immediately makes peace. Sweden soon comes to terms, followed one year later by a bankrupt France. – Prussia is saved. 
So in the game FRIEDRICH for 3 or 4 players: All against one. But only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players manoeuvre their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning. 
Celebrating the 300th birthday of Frederick the Great, Histogame presents the anniversary edition of the award-winning FRIEDRICH. Uniting the fascination of board and card games, FRIEDRICH and its unique and novel concept offer wide open spaces for brilliant chess-like moves and deep decision making. Accurately based on history, while maintaining a slim set of rules, FRIEDRICH takes you right into Frederick_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s era: an exciting experience of Prussia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s struggle for survival.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO451)
It is the summer of 1756. Frederick the Great faces the grim fact that half of Europe has formed an alliance. He is in deep sorrow: It seems to him that their aim is the annihilation of Prussia. Therefore he makes a preemptive strike against Saxony, which surrenders weeks later. But this is only the first chapter in what would become known as the Seven Years War! Prussia is completely encircled by her enemies, the biggest continental powers in Europe. England and Hanover are her only allies. - For Prussia, the situation is easy to sum up: To be or not to be. Soon the Prussian House is burning. France has conquered Northern Germany. Austria has invaded Silesia. Russian hordes are crossing the River Oder, and Berlin is a mere five days march away! Frederick is relentless. He desperately rushes from crisis to crisis within his strategic triangle, managing to check one enemy only as another takes advantage of his absence to advance. After six long years of struggle, Prussia seems doomed to fall . . . Frederick is saved by a miracle. The Russian Tsarina Elisabeth dies, and her successor has an almost infinite adoration for Frederick, and immediately makes peace. Sweden soon comes to terms, followed one year later by a bankrupt France. - Prussia is saved. So in the game FRIEDRICH for 3 or 4 players: All against one. But only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players manoeuvre their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning. Celebrating the 300th birthday of Frederick the Great, Histogame presents the anniversary edition of the award-winning FRIEDRICH. Uniting the fascination of board and card games, FRIEDRICH and its unique and novel concept offer wide open spaces for brilliant chess-like moves and deep decision making. Accurately based on history, while maintaining a slim set of rules, FRIEDRICH takes you right into Frederick_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s era: an exciting experience of Prussia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s struggle for survival. </notes>

    <notes>Cards are sleeved. The sticker for the 4th Russian army came trashed beyond use on the sticker sheet when I bought it. As a result, I color printed a copy off the internet and glued it to the playing piece. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not perfect, but perfectly passable and has absolutely zero effect on game play.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO451)
It is the summer of 1756. Frederick the Great faces the grim fact that half of Europe has formed an alliance. He is in deep sorrow: It seems to him that their aim is the annihilation of Prussia. Therefore he makes a preemptive strike against Saxony, which surrenders weeks later. But this is only the first chapter in what would become known as the Seven Years War! Prussia is completely encircled by her enemies, the biggest continental powers in Europe. England and Hanover are her only allies. - For Prussia, the situation is easy to sum up: To be or not to be. Soon the Prussian House is burning. France has conquered Northern Germany. Austria has invaded Silesia. Russian hordes are crossing the River Oder, and Berlin is a mere five days march away! Frederick is relentless. He desperately rushes from crisis to crisis within his strategic triangle, managing to check one enemy only as another takes advantage of his absence to advance. After six long years of struggle, Prussia seems doomed to fall . . . Frederick is saved by a miracle. The Russian Tsarina Elisabeth dies, and her successor has an almost infinite adoration for Frederick, and immediately makes peace. Sweden soon comes to terms, followed one year later by a bankrupt France. - Prussia is saved. So in the game FRIEDRICH for 3 or 4 players: All against one. But only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning. Celebrating the 300th birthday of Frederick the Great, Histogame presents the anniversary edition of the award-winning FRIEDRICH. Uniting the fascination of board and card games, FRIEDRICH and its unique and novel concept offer wide open spaces for brilliant chess-like moves and deep decision making. Accurately based on history, while maintaining a slim set of rules, FRIEDRICH takes you right into Frederick_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s era: an exciting experience of Prussia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s struggle for survival. </notes>

    <notes>FRIEDRICH: Bought directly from designer, played a couple of times. No marks or other visible damage. For sale by old school gamer selectively reducing his collection. All my games are stored in plastic bins in a climate controlled environment.
SHIPPING: When I ship I package thoroughly as if I were receiving the game myself. Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear first before I ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace.</notes>

Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies! Or be Frederick the Great and struggle for survival with a mixture of courageous willpower, sudden inspiration and stoic patience.
It is the summer of 1756. On the eve of the Seven Years War, half of Europe has formed an alliance. Frederick the Great is in deep sorrow: Is the annihilation of Prussia planned? Is it Prussia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s defeat or is it Prussia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s glory?
All against one – but only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning.
Histogame and Richard Sivél present Friedrich as a novel concept uniting the fascination of board and card games. Accurately based on history while maintaining a slim set of rules, Friedrich offers wide open spaces for chess-like moves and great depth for decision making. Taken into Frederick_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s era, you will reflect on tactical finesses, smile about interspersed anecdotes, and be perplexed at how often you are not able to count to three...
Note: A common misconception is that Friedrich has player elimination based on the cards of fate making countries leave the game. The game does not have player elimination; it has country elimination, and a player could end up controlling fewer countries than they started with, but players are never eliminated by the cards of fate.
Friedrich FAQ
Details on the Jubiläumsedition
In 2011 Histogame released a slightly revised version of Friedrich, dubbed the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Jubiläumsedition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Anniversay Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in honor of Friedrich_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 300th birthday. Designer Richard Sivél notes the following differences between this edition and earlier ones:
New cover art.
Four color images for the patterns of the cards.
Small rearrangements of cities on the map, such as Falkenau (in northwestern Austria) moving into the spades sector and Gollnow (close to Stettin) getting a diamonds-city neighbor.
Minor adjustment of some fate cards to clarify the wording.
