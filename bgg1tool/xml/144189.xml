    <notes>GMT Games (GMT1409)
Never Get Out of the Boat! Vietnam, 1964. The most wrenching US engagement of the Cold War would be far more than GI versus Charlie. The conflict had set tribesman against nationalist, Buddhist against Catholic, mandarin against villager, and of course Northerner against Southerner-even among the communists. As revolutionary change burned through that ancient civilization, Washington would apply its armament and its operations research. To get out, the US counterinsurgency would have to motor deeper and deeper in. In the end, culture and will would overcome technology and math and signal the end of the primacy of industrial might in modern warfare. Volume IV in GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s COIN Series dives headlong into the momentous and complex battle for South Vietnam. A unique multi-faction treatment of the Vietnam War, Fire in the Lake will take 1 to 4 players on US heliborne sweeps of the jungle and Communist infiltration of the South, and into inter-allied conferences, Saigon politics, interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, air defense of Northern infrastructure, graduated escalation, and media war. Renowned designer and modern warfare expert Mark Herman joins COIN Series creator Volko Ruhnke for a collaborative production not to be missed. Fire in the Lake features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, and A Distant Plain, with a pack of twists that take the Series to another level! As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Fire in the Lake will face difficult strategic decisions with each card. The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent operations and capabilities. Terror and subversion, pacification, infiltration, NVA long-range bombardment, road and river ambushes, VC front taxation, aid diversion, US bombing of the Trail, Montagnard recruitment, ARVN Ranger raids, and many more options are on the menu. Flow charts are at hand to run any faction missing a player-solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player experiences are equally supported. Ride on up the river.</notes>

Includes custom made sideboard for those who need to play the game facing the long edge.  Same scale as the main board, just puts the RVN Leader card and faction tracking in easier reach.</notes>

    <notes>Played twice. All components are present and in excellent condition, divided into plastic bags according to my guess at best organization. 
Looks like this will fit into the USPS priority mail _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;medium flat rate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box, which means $13.45 for shipping. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send it to you, unless you want to combine with one of my other listings, in which case I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send all in the cheapest priority mail-speed packaging I can find.
I accept payment via PayPal or, if you prefer, by Dwolla.</notes>

    <notes>Item is new in shrink, no issues with box condition.  Buyer to pay actual shipping, to be provided by USPS, if sold in the USA.  Outside U.S. buyers welcome, just Geek Mail me with interest and location details and can get a shipping estimate.  This listing includes additional player aids printed off from the net as well as an extra copy of the rules and playbooks purchased direct at GMT.  I had hopes of getting this to the table, but time is a greater enemy than I had envisioned and hoping this might find another home to be played.</notes>

    <notes>It pains me to part with these games, but I was recently in a pretty bad car accident and my vehicle was totaled. I am trying to raise some money to get a new car, public transportation in my area is not very good and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get me to many of the places I need to go.
This copy was opened, punched, sorted and bagged but never played nor have the rules been read. The cards are sleeved with FFG clear standard card game sleeves. Shipping will be actual cost, contact me with your zip code for a quote..</notes>

    <notes>Hi guys,
This game is in excellent condition as it has only been played twice, both times solo. I have attached a picture of the components. Only reason it is being sold is it will not be played as often as the other COIN games in my collection.
I would prefer an Australian buyer due to the shipping cost. But if you are happy to pay the shipping to elsewhere that will be fine.
If you are within Australia I would suggest bank transfer rather than PayPal as that is easier and  does not charge extra fees.
Thank you for your consideration.</notes>

    <notes>Games is mostly unpunched; those counters, and all card, are in baggies. The top left corner of the box took a hit in shipping, so the box is somewhat crimped there. The components inside were mostly spared however, with only a few corresponding corner dings to rules/charts/map. However, I am offering this for a lower price and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to make sure this is clear. The game is perfectly playable.
Shipping will be via Priority Mail in the US.</notes>

One page in the rule book has a very slight warp to it, doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect the page but I want to mention. Would list this game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; but due to those two factors I listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.

Hi Luka,
I’ll be in Essen from Wednesday to Sunday. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be working at Feuerland Booth (4-C116) this year. 
For handover I can offer to meet you
- during setup on Wednesday   OR 
- at the general Math Trade Meeting on Friday at 12.00. However, I’ll be at the MT meeting place already at 11.30 to avoid some of the crowd and to get a good setup location. So you’re welcome to meet me early…  :-)
I hope you will be able to make it to the meeting on Friday. If you can’t please contact me and we can work out a handover at the Feuerland Booth.
For contacting me at the fair, my mobile is +49 176 56806418. I’d appreciate if you could leave me your mobile no as well.
I’m looking forward to meeting you.
Cheers,
Carsten
