   <description>Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players. Runewars pits players against each other in a strategic game of battles and area control, where they must gather resources, raise armies, and lay siege to heavily fortified cities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Runewars takes place in the same popular fantasy universe as the board games Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark and Rune Age, and dozens of fan-favorite heroes and monsters play their part. The wars for the dragon runes are beginning, and only one faction will emerge victorious._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players. Designed by Corey Konieczka, Runewars pits players against each other in a strategic game of battles and area control, where they must gather resources, raise armies, and lay siege to heavily fortified cities.
Runewars takes place in the same popular fantasy universe as the best-selling board games Runebound and Descent: Journeys in the Dark, and dozens of fan-favorite heroes and monsters play their part. The wars for the dragon runes are beginning, and only one faction will emerge victorious. What would you do to claim the ultimate power?
Runewars includes:
-A thorough 40-page instruction guide
-Nearly two hundred highly-detailed plastic miniatures
-Over two hundred tokens
-Over two hundred cards, both small and standard sized
-13 map tiles, each composed of multiple hexes and including stunning three-dimensional mountain terrain!

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG RW01)
Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players. Designed by Corey Konieczka, Runewars pits players against each other in a strategic game of battles and area control, where they must gather resources, raise armies, and lay siege to heavily fortified cities.
Runewars takes place in the same popular fantasy universe as the best-selling board games Runebound and Descent: Journeys in the Dark, and dozens of fan-favorite heroes and monsters play their part. The wars for the dragon runes are beginning, and only one faction will emerge victorious. What would you do to claim the ultimate power?</notes>

    <notes>The game has never been played but all the pieces have been punched out and sorted into several baggies. All pieces/cards are in like new condition and accounted for.
The rulebook is in excellent shape, pretty much just flipped through it.
The box has a small amount of wear on the corners from shipping but I will pack it very securely. 
Shipping is $15 in the Con. US. Feel free to send me any questions. Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This is for Daniel Kenel (Hawkeye77) only.
Won in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;25 games - 1 Week_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; auction
I bought the game used (there is some wide, clear tape across the bottom and sides). This was not from a thrift. The box has some shelf wear, but is still solid. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been opened and mostly punched, but it was never played. I completed the last few punches. The reference sheets, for instance, are still in their original un-opened baggie.
The game is fully inventoried and complete.
I separated out the faction minis (they were all in one big bag). Some of the minis can use a heated re-adjustment but they are all there and intact.
The parts are in very good to excellent condition. I hesitate to say everything is like new as there are a few nits here and there, but mostly the game is in great shape.
Additional Elements
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing there was one extra sheet of chits as there are some extra bits. However, there are also 4 extra minis.
- 4 extra Hell Hound minis
- An extra Latari Elves playing board
- 7 extra city tiles (this is twice the number) 
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way, and will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.
This is a big, and relatively weighty box, so shipping will be higher than usual.</notes>

    <notes>Runewars, complete and in Very Good condition. Very mild shelf wear on the box. The box insert was trimmed slightly to accommodate a Plano box (included) that holds all the minis/tokens. All cards sleeved.
Due to the size and weight of the game, it will ship via USPS Parcel Post for $15.00 (with bubble wrap!). Local pickup is also an option for western Washington buyers.</notes>

Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie können Ihre Vertragserklärung innerhalb von 1 Monat ohne Angabe von Gründen in Textform (z. B. Brief, Fax, E-Mail) oder – wenn Ihnen die Sache vor Fristablauf überlassen wird – durch Rücksendung der Sache widerrufen. Die Frist beginnt nach Erhalt dieser Belehrung in Textform, jedoch nicht vor Eingang der Ware beim Empfänger (bei der wiederkehrenden Lieferung gleichartiger Waren nicht vor Eingang der ersten Teillieferung) und auch nicht vor Erfüllung unserer Informationspflichten gemäß Artikel 246 § 2 in Verbindung mit § 1 Abs. 1 und 2 EGBGB sowie unserer Pflichten gemäß § 312e Abs. 1 Satz 1 BGB in Verbindung mit Artikel 246 § 3 EGBGB. Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist genügt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs oder der Sache.
Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:
Adrian Czibere
Augustin-Buselmeier Str.24
79365 Rheinhausen
docholiday0815@yahoo.de
Widerrufsfolgen
Im Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren und ggf. gezogene Nutzungen (z. B. Zinsen) herauszugeben. Können Sie uns die empfangene Leistung ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurückgewähren, müssen Sie uns insoweit ggf. Wertersatz leisten. Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung – wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre – zurückzuführen ist. Für eine durch die bestimmungsgemäße Ingebrauchnahme der Sache entstandene Verschlechterung müssen Sie keinen Wertersatz leisten.
Paketversandfähige Sachen sind auf unsere Gefahr zurückzusenden. Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, wenn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen innerhalb von 30 Tagen erfüllt werden. Die Frist beginnt für Sie mit der Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung oder der Sache, für uns mit deren Empfang.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGRW03)
Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players. Designed by Corey Konieczka, Runewars pits players against each other in a strategic game of battles and area control, where they must gather resources, raise armies, and lay siege to heavily fortified cities. Runewars takes place in the same popular fantasy universe as the best-selling board games Runebound and Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition, and dozens of fan-favorite heroes and monsters play their part. The wars for the dragon runes are beginning, and only one faction will emerge victorious. What would you do to claim the ultimate power? </notes>

Few things to mention:
Game box has a slight bump in the middle where the components inside pushed it out a little.
The tiles have warped a little. They may flatten easily (which i_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m currently trying out myself). They aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t that bad and will all fit together ok. 
Player sheets (thin card) are a little bumpy. Happened due to the way they were stored.
None of these issues effect the game in any way though. I can post more pics if anyone would like to see in more detail.
All the other game components are in excellent condition.
Selling a few other games including:
The Witcher adventure game • Runewars (revised edition) • Level 7 Escape • Claustrophobia • Dead men tell no tales • Warhammer quest card game (Still in shrink wrap) • Arcana • Dungeon time (Kickstarter edition)</notes>

    <notes>The game is in excellent shape.  The only damage is the box top is slightly bowed on one end.  I believe it will be fine once it is flipped over and a book placed on the spot.
As this is one of FFG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s coffin box games, I will take it to UPS once it has been sold and get the shipping cost for you.  Payment should be sent to randy.dickens@outlook.com</notes>
