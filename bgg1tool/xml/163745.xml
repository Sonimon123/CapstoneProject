   <description>Massive Star Destroyers fly to battle against Rebel corvettes and frigates. Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Maneuver Tool_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The maneuver tool is one of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Command Stack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a PRE ORDER for a brand new copy of Star Wars: Armada.
The expected date is unclear at the moment - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s scheduled for Q1 2015, and looks like it should be mid-March... as soon as I have an update I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll post here and also notify everybody that has pre-ordered.
To pre-order you can either _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; it here on the marketplace or just send me a PM on boardgamegeek. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to know your delivery address, how you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pay (PayPal or bank transfer) and your email address. Once our stock is confirmed and on it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s way to our warehouse I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll then get in touch re payment and then ship the game out to you as quickly as possible. In the event that stocks are limited then the earliest placed orders will be honored first, anybody too late in the queue will be notified as soon as possible and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to help out with some alternative options (e.g. if we have an ETA for a second wave of stock).
Happy shopping!

    <notes>This copy comes with two of the Rebel Corvette models rather than just one, this is because the original one shipped with the game to me was slightly bent so I got a replacement sent out from FFG. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll put both of them in the box.
The only other thing worth mentioning is that the vertical aerial on the Star Destroyer seems to be a little shorter than other ones that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen. I honestly don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if a small piece has broken off it or if it was a manufacturing error, but either way it in no way affects the set.
Will only ship within the UK.</notes>

This sale is a package of the following retail items:
Star Wars: Armada (Core Set)
Star Wars: Armada – Gladiator-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack
Star Wars: Armada – Assault Frigate Mark II Expansion Pack
Star Wars: Armada – Imperial Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack
Star Wars: Armada – Rebel Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack
Star Wars Armada: Dice Pack
Star Wars Armada Maneuver Tool Pack
Most of the components are stored in a Plano 5231, while the larger ships will come in their original packaging (I do not have the packaging for the squadron expansion packs though). 
Buyer pays shipping costs and since the box will contain many items, I would expect this to cost upwards of $25 to ship (if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want the Plano container, let me know as this would reduce the shipping costs some). Payment is to be made via PayPal.</notes>

    <notes>In shrink wrap brand new. Picked it up for $50 on super sale but just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have anyone to play it with and plenty of other great 2 player games and folks who will play some of those with me. No sense even opening it, so no sense in keeping it.
Price is $50 + shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably use Fed Ex because I have a business account there so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s almost always the cheapest option. I promise to package it very well and ship it to you as quickly as I can. 
Pay by PayPal or, preferably but not likely since I bet you haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even heard of it, Dwolla.</notes>

    <notes>This listing includes two of every ship released in Wave 1 (counting the ships from the core set), plus a third CR90, two sets of Rebel and Imperial fighters, and an extra set of dice. Everything is organized in the printable squadron hangar boxes from the Armada files section here on BGG. All fighters have been highlighted with permanent marker, as shown in the photos attached to the listing. Items are from a smoke-free home with a hypoallergenic dog who doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play with the games.
Specific items in this listing are
1x [thing=163745][/thing] (the main listing)
1x [thing=168927][/thing]
1x [thing=169018][/thing]
1x [thing=169020][/thing]

2x [thing=168928][/thing]
1x [thing=169019][/thing]
1x [thing=169033][/thing]
Fighters are stored, and will ship, in a spare Dominion box. While I normally ship USPS Priority, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to investigate UPS or FedEx on request. I put insurance on the shipping order for a large item like this unless requested otherwise.</notes>

    <notes>Everything in this collection sells for about $480 brand new online (assuming some items are still available for sale, there wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t any reasonably priced squadron expansions when I checked)
Furthermore, I have never gotten the chance to play this game, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s essentially a new copy. I also went through all the trouble of sleeving all the cards with FFG premium sleeves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; KMC Perfect Fit + Hyper Mat so you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to!
Includes:
Star Wars: Armada (2015)
Assault Frigate Mark II Expansion Pack (2015) x 2
CR90 Corellian Corvette Expansion Pack (2015) x 2
Gladiator-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack (2015) x 2
Imperial Class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack (2015)
Imperial Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack (2015) x 2
Imperial Raider Expansion Pack (2015) 
Nebulon-B Frigate Expansion Pack (2015)
Rebel Fighter Squadrons Expansion Pack (2015) x 2
Rogues and Villains Expansion Pack (2015)
Victory-class Star Destroyer Expansion Pack (2015)
Extra Dice Pack
Extra Maneuver Tool
For comparison:
On CSI on 6/28/17 and it comes up to about $427.62.
$340 is about 20% off the price for a brand new game and all the cards have been sleeved (and this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t calculated in the $427.62 value I gave). Essentially, 20% off a brand new game without the hassle of sleeving or inventory checking. :) A good start for any would be Armada gamer!</notes>

    <notes>This game has been punched and played once. All pieces are bagged and included within. All ships have been assembled and are on their bases.
If you are interested, I will also include the Rebel Fighter Squadrons and Imperial Fighter Squadrons for and extra $20 for both or $10 dollars each.
 
This is a fine game, I just have other interests and do not want to keep up with Armada. I would rather put my money into Ares games WWI Wings of War which I prefer more. As I have heard some people say they do not agree with FFG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s development and marketing decisions. I agree and this have divested myself of many of their games. I will keep the games that they made before they went solely horror or movie licensing games. I will keep Rebellion though. 
I will ship in USA using USPS from zip code of 14216. I will send it as cheaply as possible. Do not ask for a shipping estimate. I am not making two trips to the Post Office. Once you place your order I will get the shipping estimate and send it to you. 
I will send it elsewhere in the world, but do not expect the shipping to be cheap. In my experience sending things to the Pacific (Asia) seems to be more expensive than Europe.
Note: If you make an order and do not pay me and then fail to contact me as to why you have not paid me, I will give you a negative rating. I am taking the time to go to the post office and get you an estimate. I am sending the game as cheaply as possible. Please be an honest buyer.</notes>
