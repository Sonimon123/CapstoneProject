   <description>From Bruno Faidutti's site:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It has been found again by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc with Mr.Jack Pocket, the small card game derived from Mr. Jack. The board is replaced by a square grid made of nine street cards. The suspects, and among them Mr.Jack, are pictured on the cards. Holmes, Watson and a dog are turning around the grid, a system already used by Bruno Cathala in several games, and can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;look_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; at the streets in a row or column. Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives. Of course, the detectives must identify Jack, who must stay hidden long enough to escape._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

This time he won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get away!
Discover the pocket version of Mr. Jack, the favorite investigation game of strategy game players!
As in the board version, a player takes on the role of the inspector trying to unmask Jack the Ripper while the other player takes on the role of the fleeing criminal. The difference is in the game mechanics: the infernal pursuit now takes place on a board that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 3 squares to a side, each square representing both a London street and one of the nine suspects. around the board are placed a Holmes, a Watson and a police dog token. On each turn, the first player (the inspector or Jack, in turn) uses 4 action tokens wich allow to move the investigator tokens, to reorient the tiles or to draw a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;suspect card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. A suspect is visible only if the investigator can see that suspect in the streets in front of him. Suspects hidden by buildings are invisible.
At the end of each turn, the player in the role of Jack must say if the guilty character is visible or not. If that character isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t visible, Jack earns an hourglass.
If the Jack player can earn 6 hourglasses, that player wins the game (knowing that hourglasses are earned by remaining invisible and by drawing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;suspect_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; cards). The inspetor wins if there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only a single suspect left at the end of a turn.</notes>

This time he won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get away! Discover the pocket version of Mr. Jack, the favorite investigation game of strategy game players! As in the board version, a player takes on the role of the inspector trying to unmask Jack the Ripper while the other player takes on the role of the fleeing criminal. The difference is in the game mechanics: the infernal pursuit now takes place on a board that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 3 squares to a side, each square representing both a London street and one of the nine suspects. around the board are placed a Holmes, a Watson and a police dog token. On each turn, the first player (the inspector or Jack, in turn) uses 4 action tokens which allow to move the investigator tokens, to reorient the tiles or to draw a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;suspect card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. A suspect is visible only if the investigator can see that suspect in the streets in front of him. Suspects hidden by buildings are invisible. At the end of each turn, the player in the role of Jack must say if the guilty character is visible or not. If that character isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t visible, Jack earns an hourglass. If the Jack player can earn 6 hourglasses, that player wins the game (knowing that hourglasses are earned by remaining invisible and by drawing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;suspect_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; cards). The inspector wins if there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only a single suspect left at the end of a turn. </notes>

This time he won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get away! Discover the pocket version of Mr. Jack, the favorite investigation game of strategy game players! As in the board version, a player takes on the role of the inspector trying to unmask Jack the Ripper while the other player takes on the role of the fleeing criminal. The difference is in the game mechanics: the infernal pursuit now takes place on a board that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 3 squares to a side, each square representing both a London street and one of the nine suspects. around the board are placed a Holmes, a Watson and a police dog token. On each turn, the first player (the inspector or Jack, in turn) uses 4 action tokens which allow to move the investigator tokens, to reorient the tiles or to draw a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;suspect card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. A suspect is visible only if the investigator can see that suspect in the streets in front of him. Suspects hidden by buildings are invisible. At the end of each turn, the player in the role of Jack must say if the guilty character is visible or not. If that character isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t visible, Jack earns an hourglass. If the Jack player can earn 6 hourglasses, that player wins the game (knowing that hourglasses are earned by remaining invisible and by drawing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;suspect_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; cards). The inspector wins if there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only a single suspect left at the end of a turn.</notes>

    <notes>Experienced eBay seller, new to BGG selling. Love games.
Opened but never used. See photos.
Payment:
Bank Transfer BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Preferred if possible, buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
PayPal (Buyer pays fees or preferably, select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. All my games are exactly as described and are posted next working day after payment is received. Any issues will be swiftly looked into in a professional and courteous manner.)
To speed up the process, if paying by PayPal, send payments (Game + Standard or Registered P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P + any Fees required) to:  patzer1941@gmail.com
Copy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Paste the e-mail, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t type it.
Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 4.90
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 6.35
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 6.35
Registered Post: (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 8.10
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 11.40
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 11.40
Registered post everywhere else. 
Combined postage for multiple items where possible.
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilo is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for details if this applies to your items purchased.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>
