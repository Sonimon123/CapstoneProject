After controlling a line between two cities with your pawns you can decide to build an office (and maybe also establish control and/or get a bonus marker) or to get a skill improvement from some of the cities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players have to improve their traders' _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;skills_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; for the following effects: getting more VP from offices in their network, getting more available action points, increasing the number of available pawns, and getting the right to place pawns and get more special pawns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game appeared originally as Wettstreit der H_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;ndler at the Hippodice competition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Theme: The Hanseatic League (also known as Hansa Teutonica) was a medieval alliance between merchant guilds of cities in lower Germany which expanded soon into the North Sea and Baltic Sea area. Many of the participating cities became very powerful and proudly called themselves Hansa cities. Players compete for wealth and prestige as merchants in the Hanseatic League. There are many opportunities to do so: they may set up a network of branch offices in as many cities as possible, but they should also develop their talents and trading skills to become succesful merchants. Developing such trading skills allows players to become more effective in their activities. They may gain additional actions, higher income, new privileges, and improved prestige point return. Developing your preferred profile will bring you in an advantageous position for your strategy against the other players. Hansa Teutonica is very open to your concepts and gives you the freedom you need to accomplish your way to the top. Clever use of your traders, perpetual observation of your opponents activities, continious improvement of your skills and the right use of prestigious activities are the key to become the most succesful merchant in the history of the Hanse.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7050)
Deutsche Hanse or, in Latin, Hansa Teutonica, are alternative names for the Hanseatic League, an alliance between merchant guilds and (later) between cities originating from lower Germany. Cities that joined the League were called Hansa cities. The League emerged (rather than being explicitly founded) in the middle of the 12th century. Since there was no formal application to join until the later half of 14th century, it was impossible to tell which cities belonged to the League during this period. It was believed, however, that almost 200 cities were involved in some capacity with the League. 
Players attempt to increase their standing as merchants in the Hanseatic League by gaining prestige points. This may be done in different ways: Establishing a network of Counting Offices in new Hansa cities may be as promising as improving trading skills. Players accomplish various activities during their moves. Traders may be inserted on the gameboard, moved, or even displace traders of other players. If they eventually occupy an entire trade route between two cities, a new Counting Office may be established. But players may also develop their trading skills, instead in particular cities, improving their abilities throughout the course of play. The winner of the game is the player who gains the most Prestige Points.

    <notes>This is the first edition of the game (from Argentum Verlag) with rules in both German and English.  Purchased at BGG.CON 2009.
The game is punched but unplayed.  All components have been accounted for.  The outside box is still in excellent condition.  You can barely see indentations on the outside box if you look carefully enough.  The rule booklet has been skimmed through once, if that.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.

    <notes>(MUST ALSO PURCHASE THE EAST EXPANSION FROM ME)
Never played, pristine condition.  If there was an insert in the box I have removed it for easier storage of components and the expansion into the original box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

I do not add handling fees or over charge on shipping, I only charge the exact amount. Geek mail me for a shipping quote.
I will combine shipping, however, it may take me a day or 2 longer to ship due to finding the right size box. Click on my user name above to see any other games I am selling.

    <notes>The game is brand - new, never opened.
I ship USPS flat rate priority mail when possible, and I usually ship the same day or next day once I have notification of a sale.
If it can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in a flat rate it may take a few days longer as I may have to find a more suitable box.
Please feel free to look at and ask about any other games I own for purchase, and reduce your shipping costs as well. I will verify the condition of each game before confirming the sale.
I am trying to sell off my collection.
