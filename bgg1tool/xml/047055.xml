   <description>In the near future, nanofacturing techniques will allow incredible new materials to be built atom by atom. But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space. Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid. To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant. Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit). At first, water will be expensively supported out of the deep gravity well of Earth. But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects.  Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system.  Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics.  Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts.  Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Now in its second edition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Sierra Madre Games (SMG 28)
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;arguably the best game of 2010_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mike Barnes.  The most scientific sci-fi game ever produced! Recommended for two to five players, ages 12 and higher. Design rockets to explore and industrialize the solar system. You will need to find water out there as reaction mass for your rocket. Points are awarded according to the scarcity of the space-products produced, glory, colonies, and mega-engineering projects. 
A boxed game with rocket, freighter, and factory plastic pieces, along with rules, patent cards, rocket diagrams, and a unique mounted _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;delta-v_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the inner solar system.
When people finally emigrate into space, the motivation will be space nanofacturing using processes possible only in zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions. The key to economic production is finding water on suitable worlds, for rocket propellent and life support. Also key is designing efficient rockets and the remote-controlled machines called robonauts to do the grunt work. Each space mission must be flexible due to changing conditions and emergencies. A chart keeps track of supply and demand of various space products.
A High Frontier expansion is available, see SMG28a. This extends the map to include Jupiter and Saturn

    <notes>Sierra Madre Games (SIM 28)
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;arguably the best game of 2010_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mike Barnes. The most scientific sci-fi game ever produced! Recommended for two to five players, ages 12 and higher. Design rockets to explore and industrialize the solar system. You will need to find water out there as reaction mass for your rocket. Points are awarded according to the scarcity of the space-products produced, glory, colonies, and mega-engineering projects. 
A boxed game with rocket, freighter, and factory plastic pieces, along with rules, patent cards, rocket diagrams, and a unique mounted _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;delta-v_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the inner solar system.
When people finally emigrate into space, the motivation will be space nanofacturing using processes possible only in zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions. The key to economic production is finding water on suitable worlds, for rocket propellent and life support. Also key is designing efficient rockets and the remote-controlled machines called robonauts to do the grunt work. Each space mission must be flexible due to changing conditions and emergencies. A chart keeps track of supply and demand of various space products.
A High Frontier expansion is available, see SIM28a. This extends the map to include Jupiter and Saturn</notes>

    <notes>Sierra Madre Games (SRM 28)
In the near future, nanofacturing techniques will allow incredible new materials to be built atom by atom. But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space. Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid. To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant. Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work.
The key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit). At first, water will be expensively upported out of the deep gravity well of Earth. But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects. Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.

    <notes>This is the reprint (2nd edition) with the expansion, punched, unplayed, and in mint condition. Everything is in the base game box, and this will ship via FedEx (should be about $13, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund the difference if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lower).
Looks like an absolutely wonderful game, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get anyone to play it. Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hoping it goes to a good home.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and inspected but never played, pristine condition. First edition with B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;W player mats, however I have included two printed and laminated color versions. Includes other laminated reference material. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling the expansion: you can by either or both for the same shipping price.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>The game is new and sealed. The only issue is that the back of the box is starting to naturally bow inwards. Otherwise this is an absolutely excellent tiptop condition. This is your chance to get a very rare game at a unbeatable price. Shipping and handling is $12 to the United States only. That includes bubblewrap protection and tracking! Price is firm.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in the expansion, I am selling it new for $60 but will include it with this purchase for only $50 extra and won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t increase the shipping and handling cost.</notes>

    <notes>Point to point shipping with European users in those countries where Mondial Relay service is provided. USA and other countries users shipping via Postal Service. This doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t weight a ton, so it may be doable.
The price includes both the original game, plus _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;High Frontier: Expansion Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, also in mint condition, unopened. Buyers willing to pay with Paypal will be charged 4€ more in order to cover part of Paypal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s comission. Bank transfer prefered.   
El paquete incluye el juego original + _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;High Frontier: Expansion Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, la expansión que se publicó junto al juego original. Ambos productos conservan el celofán y ni siquiera han sido abiertos.
El pago se efectuaría por transferencia o ingreso bancario. Otra opción es el pago contra reembolso, pero esto encarece el envío y supongo que acaba siendo más caro que la comisión por transferencia bancaria. Es posible pagar por Paypal, pero el comprador asume un cargo adicional de 4 euros para cubrir parte de la comisión de esta entidad.
El envío se realizaría a través de Correos. El envío por Kiala (kiala.es) es otra opción más económica y cómoda que dependerá del comprador, pero que recomiendo.</notes>

This is the ziplock version discussed by Phil Eklund in this thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1158708.
According to Phil, this copy is missing 1) the rocket sheets which can be downloaded from the High Frontier groups forum, 2) the bingo tokens for claims, and 3) the box.</notes>

    <notes>All games come a smoke free home, they have been carefully stored and protected.  My late husband was an avid board game and collector.

Complete copy in good condition. The base game is the 2010 First Printing edition with the black and white fuel strips. The rulebook is a little warn on the outside (shown in photo). One of the cards from the colonization module has some indentations or something on it (shown in photos). The boards from the two editions don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to line up the map lines perfectly (again shown in photo). I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if this is common or not.

    <notes>This is for High Frontier 2nd edition + Colonization + the Interstellar map printed by Zazzle.
I bought this copy on Geek Market and piecing together the parts inventory has been a bit confusing. I believe everything is complete but please see the note below about the cards. Base game box is included (I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if Colonization came with a box or not).
Base game verified components:
Basic map
Placeholder sheet
5 player mats
5 original crew cards
18 black discs
52 transparent discs
30 opaque discs
30 cubes
10 rockets
25 cards* (see below)
1 d6
Colonization:
Rulebook (with cover and end pages intact)
Expanded map x2 (my copy came with two copies of this, and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know why)
10 hemispheres (Bernals)
5 cubes (freighters)
15 discs (3 x 5 for each player color) (claims)
10 yellow discs (outposts)
3 black discs (busted sites)
32 module cards
27 support cards*
Other:
5 alternate crew cards
5 alternate player mats
1 Interstellar map (poster size; I have folded this but it should lay flat with plexiglass or a poster-sized sleeve)
* The basic rulebook states there are 24 thruster/robonaut/refinery cards; I count 25. The Colonization rulebook says there are 28 support cards; I count 27. I believe one of the cards actually belongs to the other deck but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know which.
Shipping will be calculated at checkout, but no more than $13 (USPS medium flat rate).</notes>
