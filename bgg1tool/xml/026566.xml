    <notes>Very nice shape, opened and set up but unplayed. This is the first edition. Should be a 3 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games (TTT 1002)
Homesteaders is an auction and resource management game in which players bid on the right to build certain types of buildings, and then build their desired building of that type. Each round features an income phase, where players acquire resources, and an auction and building phase, in which players bid for available land, and then spend their resources to develop a building on that land. The game is played over 10 turns, made up of 3 stages. Turns 1-4 comprise the Settlement stage, turns 5-8 comprise the Town stage, and turns 9-10 comprise the City stage. The buildings which are available for development vary through the stages, as buildings that were important when the settlement started, such as Farms and Markets, are no longer needed and new buildings become important as the city grows, such as a Train Station and Railway Terminals. </notes>

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games Second Edition.  Opened and played once, in excellent condition. Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Terrific game of developing a Wild West town – starting with just a homestead. The key is winning the initial auctions each turn. I now have the European edition, which has a different box from the original, but the same contents.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £20.83 (net of UK tax - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country).
I charge shipping at cost and I can offer several options (or ask me to get a quote from couriers).
To UK addresses:
myHermes (2-3 working days, tracked) £3.98
Second class post (2-3 working days) £3.36
First class post (1 working day) £6.54
To other EU countries:
Air mail (1 week or so) £14.77
Outside the EU:
Air mail in Europe (1 week or so) £12.31
Air mail (about 1 week, no tracking) £19.60 (Australasia)/£18.05 (USA, Canada _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; elsewhere)
Surface mail (up to 8 weeks, no tracking) £12.11</notes>

    <notes>Punched but unplayed.
This copy is first edition. However, it does NOT have any of the mildew issues that were seen with some copies of the first edition - some of us got lucky :)  I carefully inspected every component when I first bought it and again before listing it for sale in the BGG marketplace. The game is in great shape and has never been played.</notes>
