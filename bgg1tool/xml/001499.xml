    <notes>This game is mostly unpunched and never played.  The box has some wear and dishing from being stacked but no torn corners.  It is 100% complete, I counted every single token.  The rules have some moderate wear from being read numerous times and on the very back page has a slight brownish tint from a beverage accident.  It is not significant.
This is the 5th Edition.
Buyer will pay postage not to exceed the USPS Priority Mail flat rate of $8.95.  Insurance would be an additional $1.65.  International buyers would need to contact me for rates.</notes>

    <notes>WiF Deluxe - The Final Edition.  In addition to the expansion sets originally packaged with this edition (Ships in Flames, Planes in Flames, Asia Aflame, Africa Aflame, Mech in Flames), my copy includes Convoys in Flames, Cruisers in Flames, and Carrier Planes in Flames.  Excellent condition, never played (lack of time!).  All components present and correct; a few countersheets punched, but the majority remain intact (16 sheets are still unpunched).</notes>

    <notes>This is the 5th Edition game (whic is different than the final edition).   This game is unpunched / unplayed.   The rulebook does show signs of being read (fully intact, but slightly stained where it was being held).
As a bonus I have included counter sheet 6 from Days of Decision.  It is mostly unpunched, but is missing all of the country flags (they are probably the least important piece in the game and only needed if you play DoD).  All the bonus units that work in the base game are still unpunched on the counter sheet.
$10 shipping for anywhere in the US.  International buyers are welcome and shipping will be at cost (quotes can be provided).
Actual picture of the game is below.

Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

    <notes>Unpunched Australian Design Group game World in Flames, 4th edition with both 4th and 5th edition countersheets. Both sets are unpunched.
In fact, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s two of everything: rules, production spiral, map sets, forms. Only the one counterset says 5th edition. No dice included.
All components in near new condition. Box in great shape, no shelf wear just one little bruised corner.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $20 to Canada, $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>I have listed this as Very Good rather than Like New as about 25% of the counters have been seperated from their sprues. However, they have not been used. The game has never been played.
Please note that this is the 5th Edition - 5th Edition mapsheets, countersheets (including Days of Decision), 5th Edition rulebook and Scenario booklet, play aids etc.
The game box and all components are in excellent condition. In particular, the mapsheets and printed material is in pristine condition. The same goes for the counters, save for the fact that some have popped out of their sprues.
Please contact me for shipping costs, especially if you live outside the UK.
I pack very safely/securely.

    <notes>This is a hybrid version I would say.
It has the 4th Edition rules and mapsheets, but the combat charts are duplicated, in the sense that there are both 4th and 5th Edition versions in the box.
The counters are the 5th Edition not the 4th Edition.
All components are in excellent condition. The counters, while punched, do not look to have had any use at all.
Please contact me for shipping costs if you live outside the UK.
Shipping in the UK is GBP 11.22, recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.

    <notes>Condition - Moderate shelf wear to box, with split in upper right of box lid. Rule book has yellowing and is dog eared. Counters are punched but in excellent condition, appearing unplayed. Map and other materials in excellent condition with almost no wear or yellowing. This was a personal copy that I bought two decades ago, read the rules several times but never got a chance to play, and I packed the game along with me over several moves since. The game is almost certainly complete, but is sold as is.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Turns out my copy is a little bit of a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;mutt_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-- the counters, maps, and some charts say 5th edition, while the rules and some other charts say 4th edition.  From the forums it looks like some other people have copies with a similar mix of 4th/5th edition-labeled components, so I am confident this is totally playable as is.
Unpunched so listed as Like New, but note that the box itself is not in Like New condition-- it has dishing and some little nicks.  100% complete, unpunched, and even includes some extras-- several strategy articles about the game cut out from wargaming magazines-- see photos.</notes>

    <notes>3rd edition unpunched.  Plus punched verified complete Days of Decision and Fatal Alliances. These less complex versions without all the layers of rules are much easier to game solo and/or learn the system in stages like squad leader. Which is what I plan to do with my 3rd edition. My gaming group was just getting into World in Flames when I left the hobby for about 20 years. Indeed I still have my unpunched 3rd from 1985. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also receive a robust articles collection from my extensive periodical library. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be compiling one for myself too.

Eventually I may end with a 3rd through 2003/07 final deluxe _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;smorsgasbord_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; edition with everything including all the annuals, Days of Decision and Fatal Alliances too.

Rated good as the box has one split corner and another corner banged up pretty good.  Square and straight with a couple of beat up corners.  Great cheaper way to get a grail game with virtually new components.  Worldwide shipping and will be packed well.  All forms of negotiable instruments considered.
