   <description>Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game. Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of the galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 392)
Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy.The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew’s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. Ifthey succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew.
Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork.</notes>

Played once. Really wish I could get it back onto the table. Game is in great condidtion. The CD_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are switched (as it common for this game). The training CD is the mission CD and vice versa.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 392)
Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy.The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew’s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. Ifthey succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew.
 Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 392)
Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy.The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew’s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. Ifthey succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew.
 Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork.</notes>

 Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy.The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. Ifthey succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew. Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO392)
Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy. The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. If they succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew. Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO392)
Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy. The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. If they succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew. Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games  (RIO392)
Space Alert is a team survival game. Players take on the role of a crew of space explorers sent out through hyperspace to survey a dangerous sector of the Galaxy. The spaceship automatically maps the sector in 10 minutes. The crew_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s task is to defend the ship until the mission is complete. If they succeed, the ship brings back valuable data. If they fail... it is time to train a new crew. Space Alert is not a typical board game. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, they work together against the challenge presented by the game. The difficulty of this challenge can be chosen by the players themselves. Completing the most difficult missions requires close teamwork.</notes>

    <notes>I consider the game in great condition but it has been played a few times, so there may be some minor wear. PayPal Only!
Shipping is from Burbank (91504) or can arrange for local pickup if you live around Los Angeles. As an estimate, shipping from Burbank to New York City was just over $12. No packaging/handling fees. Will combine with my other game sales for better deal on shipping.
Feel free to send any questions. Cheers!</notes>

    <notes>Played once, in like new condition (cubes are wood, NOT plastic). Shipping will be the USPS Medium Flat Rate ($13), if you live in CA, NV or AZ it might be $3-4 cheaper for standard Priority Mail and I always check before payment for cheapest price. I will ship with any of my other items to reduce shipping cost and/or can arrange for local pick up (Los Angeles, 91607).
Let me know if you have any questions.

    <notes>German Edition
The game is in near perfect condition. No damaged parts, no tears to the box, everything just like new. I put the CDs in some cases to protect them. I played the game two times, it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t click though, hopefully someone gets more fun out of it.
Shipping to Germany is an additional 6 €. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into shipping for other European countries once I know the destination of the parcel.</notes>
