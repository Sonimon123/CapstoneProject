   <description>Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Back on September 30, 2015, Gloomhaven kickstarter ended, and I had backed the game at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;with minis_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; level. It looked interesting, but over the course of the next 16 months, I realized the game really didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t interest me. On top of that, I have several friends that bought it, so I will probably have a chance to play it at some time. 
It arrived February 4th 2017, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s massive. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d heard some people had issues with shipping, but mine arrived intact and with no issues.
The game is well packed in a snug box with foam padding, and then this box will be packed in a larger box with padding. I will use the boxes that were used when it was originally shipped to me, but will pad the larger box better than Amazon did - and I will tape the outside box better as well.
Shipping charges listed below are for USPS Priority. For Zones 6, 7 and 8 FedEx will likely be less. The listed prices include $250.00 insurance.
Package Info and Shipping From 63141:

    <notes>Opened, peeked at, put back in original shipping carton. Smoke-free home.
The whole package - all the content, all the stretch goals all the minis. Pledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH MINIS level gets you this.
Note that this level does not come with standees for the character classes.
Shipping and additional insurance will be approximately $45 (I will cap it at $45 and if it is less, depending on where you live, I will refund the difference). I ship within one day of payment.
US only.
Thank you.</notes>

    <notes>Standees version.
3 scenarios played with 2 players - only 2 characters used.  Everything is in excellent condition (cards were sleeved before play).  Punched components are sorted and bagged.  2 to hit decks, monster hit deck, monster AI cards, initial road and city encounter cards, battle goal cards, and base character level one skill cards are sleeved.  I will include remainder of sleeve packs for buyer to sleeve additional cards, as needed.  I will also include upper deck card card pages (pack of 10) for displaying shop items.
The legacy components of the game have been reset, where possible, to new out of box.  The only things not able to be reset follow:  board has several location stickers on it and 2 prosperity boxes (not levels - 2 out of 4 steps from levels 1 to 2) checked off, and scenario book has 3 scenario checkboxes and 3 loot checkboxes checked off.  These would be the results of most initial 3 plays of the game, and so has very little impact on new plays outside of very, very minor early spoilers (map location stickers on board).  A party wanting to start from scratch just needs to not check off their first two prosperity gains, and needs to look at the prerequisite first section of each scenario so that they know which of the handful of sticker locations on the board they can go to.  Checked off boxes in the scenario book have no impact except to indicate they have been completed by a group - this is easy to ignore for new groups.
This is a very large box.
Ships from Falls Church, VA (22042) via lowest-cost insurable option of USPS, UPS, or FedEx. I have a mail scale and purchase postage digitally, so will provide you with exact shipping cost including discounts for online purchase of postage. I am able to offer local pickup on weekends in Falls Church/Arlington (infant + job limits my availability and travel options).
This is a non-smoking home without pets, and I take great care to maintain my games, even those that are played heavily.</notes>

    <notes>My surprise job change is someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gain!
Brand new.  Pre-ordered direct from publisher (Cephalofair) in June of last year and received couple of weeks ago.
Only thing I did was to take it out of shipping box and remove shrink wrap, no components even removed from game box. 
Would not have done even this if I had known of job change several days later, making it next to impossible for me to do justice to this eagerly anticipated game.
To summarize: game box and components are brand new and in perfect condition, no shipping damage.
Was one of lucky ones where Amazon learned from mistakes and double-boxed this,
plus added cell foam all around.  Best packing I have witnessed in fact.  
I will ship out in same box, even adding some packing.  However I can take no responsibility to how it arrives.
I will ship to continental U.S. only.   Shipping obviously extra.   Shipping ranges from $37 (mid-Atlantic) to $50 (West Coast).
Will ship via UPS, within 3 days of receiving payment.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling my kickstarter Version with minis.
The game has been punched, bagged and sorted but remains unplayed and is in perfect condition.
I will ship insured through DHL which would be 8.99 within Germany and 15.99 for the rest of Europe. 
Feel free to check out my other offers on the geekmarket. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be moving soon so up until the summer I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be trying to get rid of quite a bit of stuff. 
Free pickup is possible in Hannover/Germany. 
I will ship outside of the EU but will have to insist on you contacting me first too discuss shipping and prices.
Direct bank transfers are definitely preferred but I also accept PayPal.
Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate contacting me in case you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This was opened and everything put in proper place. It was setup once and played for three scenarios.  The map has 8 stickers on it out of the 97. This just marks places on the map that you can go however even if all the stickers were on the map you would list were you want to go on your party sheet. All envelops and characters you can unlock are still sealed never been open. All of the characters have there own Mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not standees I was very happy about this. 
 Easily over 100hrs of play through 97 scenarios that you can unlock.  This is a steal of a price as this is virtually unable to get. The box is VERY heavy for a game and is in a large box. BBG has this as weighing 3.8 pounds I can tell you it is DEF more. Shipping will be around $30 depending on were you are shipping too. The weight and box dimensions is the reason. Even with that the price is insanely good. Get it whilst you can. :) The white envelops you see in the pics below are all the bad guys separated and labeled for easy finding. Some have three or four different types to a single envelope but have there names on the front :)</notes>

One corner of box contains a split (~50%): box lid and base, will upload photos. Received this way as many backers did.
Scoundrel and Brute minis have a quick 5 minute paint job on them. Everything returned to original envelopes and boxes, all complete, nothing changed that would affect your play of first scenario and beyond.
Played first scenario, applying stickers to map board for completion of that and also the second location on board. Two total stickers applied.
Everything needed for first scenario is punched and sorted, rest remain unpunched and in perfect condition.

  I just shipped something of a similar weight to the US, so it will be pricey.

Box corners have been taped to prevent splitting (that already started before I even opened the box).  I will send pictures if you are interested. Bonus: includes a paper copy of the map (for use if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to put stickers on the actual game board).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
I will wrap the box in bubble wrap, and place in a sturdy shipping box.  This sucker is heavy! (17 pounds)  Let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. If you do NOT request (and do NOT pay extra for) insurance (the decision is totally up to you) then you agree to assume responsibility for a lost or damaged package.</notes>

    <notes>New - there is no shrink but the little plastic tabs to keep the box from opening are still intact, meaning this is unopened.  I will ship in the same manner it was shipped to me - inside a tight box which is within a larger box with packing material. This is not a small/light game, so shipping will not be cheap - especially if you live on the west coast.  Local pickup is possible - I am in SE MI, near Ann Arbor.  GM me with any questions, I accept paypal, venmo, and amazon payments.</notes>

All sealed components are still sealed including all non-starting characters. Cardboard punch-outs sorted and stored as seen in this post: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3384650/gloomhaven I will include the two organizers. Obviously a heavy and large game so expect high shipping but I am happy to work with you on vendor/shipping speed etc. if you have a preference.

I have my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition Kickstarter edition of Gloomhaven for sale...
It is the edition that has both the Minis and the Standees, and I have only taken the lid off it to check the contents...
It hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played, or even setup, so in excellent, as new, condition...
Because of the weight of it, I can only ship it to a U.K. address, but the above price does include UK shipping (with tracking)...
I am happy to accept either PayPal (please add 3% to cover the fees) or Bank Transfer...
Any questions, please feel free to ask...
Cheers,

The standees and the tokens have all been put in plastic storage boxes etc. All I have done is start to setup the first scenario. So I opened a couple of hero boxes and that‚Äôs it. No stickers used and a little bit of pencil marks on the starting sheets. Box its excellent, its all in the pictures

    <notes>Kickstarter exclusive standee version + miniatures (best of both worlds).  
Components are complete and in excellent condition.  Miniatures are unpainted.  Combat modifier decks and monster action decks are sleeved.
Game is used.  Everything has been reset back into the starting boxes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; envelopes as if the game was new.  The only thing not reset is the board: it has a bunch of stickers on it and ink check marks on the prosperity line.  I recommend printing off a fresh board and stickers (see the files section for the game) or using the interactive PDF and do not look at the included board so as not to spoil anything for yourself.  If you want, I will remove the board and unused stickers from the box so that you are not tempted!  The scenario book and rule book have check marks in places marking off accomplishments and the official errata have been written in.  Some enhancement stickers are missing but there are plenty left.  One sheet is missing from some of the character pads but there are several left on each pad.
This is a large, heavy game.  Shipping will $20 - $30 depending on distance from Michigan.</notes>

Gloomhaven ist ein taktisches Kampfspiel im Euro-Stil und spielt in einer hartn√§ckigen und sich schnell ver√§ndernden Welt.

Diese Version beinhaltet alle erreichten Stretchgoals aus der Kickstarter Kampagne, darunter 18 Miniaturen f√ºr die verschiedenen Charakterklassen! Lediglich die kleine Kickstarter Danksagungsanmerkung ist nicht enthalten!
Das Spiel ist neu, originalverpackt und bereits in meinen H√§nden.

    <notes>**Comes with 3D traps and doors+1 player board**
Played the first tutorial mission once. Didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use any stickers or open anything that was sealed. I Have a 3D printer and printed out 7 of each traps and 2 doors for the game that I will ship with. They are unpainted but it would be easy if you wanted to paint them, or even unpainted they look fine. Also comes with 1 player board that was 3D printed. Photos included. If you want more, message me and we can talk price. 
As with all the other people who got the game, the box is slightly damaged on the corners due to the sheer weight of the components on the inside during shipping. Also, my 1 sticker sheet (pic included) had some of the +1 stickers get loose because the components folded the sticker sheet a little and allowed them to be lifted. I was able to find them in the box and put them back on the sticker sheet(pic included but its before I found the stickers). I only played the one game, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not even sure what they are used for. I did punch out all the characters and organize them in baggies. I assure you, this is for your convenience because it took me 2 hours lol. 
Shipping will be 25$, it weighs 21lbs.
You can do a local pickup in NE Ohio. And if you are patient, possible in Pittsburgh.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter exclusive standee version + miniatures (best of both worlds). 
Components are complete and in excellent condition. Miniatures are unpainted. Combat modifier decks and monster action decks are sleeved.
Game is used. Everything has been reset back into the starting boxes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; envelopes as if the game was new. The only thing not reset is the board: it has a bunch of stickers on it and ink check marks on the prosperity line. I recommend printing off a fresh board and stickers (see the files section for the game) or using the interactive PDF and do not look at the included board so as not to spoil anything for yourself. If you want, I will remove the board and unused stickers from the box so that you are not tempted! The scenario book and rule book have check marks in places marking off accomplishments and the official errata have been written in. Some enhancement stickers are missing but there are plenty left. One sheet is missing from some of the character pads but there are several left on each pad.
This is a large, heavy game. Shipping will be from 43224.</notes>

    <notes>Played the first mission. Have not destroyed any cards. I did place the initial stickers on the board but there is plenty of game left to explore. The minis are unpainted but it would be easy if you wanted to paint them, or even unpainted they look fine. If you want some photos, message me. Basically the game is the kickstarter version with standees and minis. 
The box is slightly damaged on the corners due to the sheer weight of the components on the inside during shipping. I was torn between rating this _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; The components are in excellent shape but I rated it very good due to the fact that I did use a couple stickers on the map.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also accept an Amazon eGift sent to an email address as payment for the game+shipping.
Shipping will be about $50 in the United States, it weighs 21lbs. I live in Tucson, AZ if someone wants to manage a pickup.</notes>

    <notes>English KS STANDEE edition. Game is unplayed and in new/like new condition. Did not come in shrinkwrap. Opened when received to verify contents were complete. Because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened it I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m calling it Like New per BGG policy. Game was reboxed and stored in original shipping container. Has been stored in original shipping box and ever since and has not been reopened. Will ship within original shipping box. Game came well packed with thick foam sheets between all six sides of game box and shipping box. No split corners or other damage.
Will ship from Pacific Northwest so shipping rates should be a bit more reasonable in the NW quadrant of the U.S.
The image below is of this copy being sold within the original shipping box.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve come to the somewhat painful conclusion that my group is just not sufficiently enthused to see this game through the full campaign. So, after a handful of plays, I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to find a more deserving home for this ambitiously designed game. 
The box is in excellent condition, but the insert (which didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t work nearly as well as I had hoped) has been tossed. The components are generally in very good condition--showing little to no wear. None of the cards have been destroyed or stickered, and none of the sealed envelopes have been opened. Four of the character sheets have been used (one each for four of the starting heroes), but several sheets remain on each of the respective pads.
The only thing that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not fully re-settable with this copy is the map--which has around 20 stickers applied (some marked, some not) and two x-marks on the prosperity track. If interested, feel free to geekmail for a picture. (And, for what it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s worth, it looks like files of the sticker sheets are available for download from BGG.)
Shipping cost will be the actual cost to ship from 95008. This is a large, heavy box, so feel free to geek mail for a quote. Local pickup in San Jose, CA, is available as well.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is a copy of Gloomhaven with the removable stick set (in hand). It has only been played once and is in very good condition. There is one sticker on the board which is from the removable sticker pack that will also come with the game.
The foam pieces used to keep the game intact during shipping have been carved to hold the villians for easy storage.
Shipping will be $30 to the lower 48 as this game weighs more than the rest of my collection combined. If shipping to anywhere else, I will charge actual cost which could be a small fortune.
Please feel free to ask questions or offer trades. I would love to trade this for Star Wars the Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Gambit. 
Thanks a bunch!</notes>

So many games coming and common sense convinced me that I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have adequate time to devote to this beast. No additional shipping needed if purchased before the KS fulfillment begins and it can be sent directly to you. If purchased after this deadline, shipping will need to be added and will be sent back out the day after I receive it.</notes>

    <notes>*As long as you purchase this before the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Address Lock-Down_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (which is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very soon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; according to Isaac_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s recent email), shipping will be free; after that, you pay for shipping which would be between $16.10 and $44.52 depending on how far you are from Pittsburgh*
I backed a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven including the Solo Scenarios (and solo item cards) and the Character Standees. I am selling the game itself but I want to keep the add-ons (to use with the first edition copy I have). By agreeing to purchase this, you agree to mail me the add-ons after receiving the game and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll reimburse you for those shipping costs. I know this sounds a bit unconventional but I think it makes the most sense given the circumstances.
PAYMENT: I would prefer Paypal, but would definitely accept Popmoney or Venmo, too.
Thanks for your consideration!</notes>

    <notes>This is the second printing of GLOOMHAVEN (including miniatures and Solo Scenarios.)
A fresh set of removable stickers can be included! (See below for details.)
Status of the legacy components:
- We only used the initial heroes and all other hero boxes are still sealed.
- No other sealed components were opened.
- No cards have any stickers on them.
- The map has some stickers on it that can easily be removed. (This is the 
  only component of the game that has been altered. One scenario sticker
  is missing.)
With a second set of stickers it is very easy to completely reset the game
and restore its original starting state. I have ordered a fresh set of 
removable stickers from Sinister Fish that have not yet arrived. I would be
willing to send these to you once I get them.
 
Alternatively, you can order them yourself here: 
    https://www.sinisterfish.com/product/gloomhaven-removable-sticker-set-retail/
The game itself was handled with care and stored in a non smoking 
environment; everything is in very good condition, most of the heroes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;
starting cards come sleeved (Dragon Shield Clear Matte).
Shipping within German: 10,- ‚Ç¨.
Shipping within the EU: 25,- ‚Ç¨.
Optional shipping of fresh sticker set once they arrive: +10,00 ‚Ç¨.
Payment via bank transfer only.

    <notes>I received this yesterday.   Punched everything.   Counted all the cards.   Everything is in great shape.   Tonight I set it up for the 1st scenario just as a practice run.  Did not mark on any of the sheets.    
I sat there looking at the action cards and trying to figure out what I was going to do, then looked at all the characters and the scenario book, etc.   
I then just decided that I have so many games that I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to spend a lot of time on any one of them.  And, this one would take so long and so much work that I just realized it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not for me. I had to get it though to see what it was all about....it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not something I want to spend tons of time with but I really wish I did because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s super cool.
So, selling this...it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all in great shape...PLUS the solo scenario book is with it.    I will put everything in zip locs...try and put some bubble wrap around all the tiles...might use another box as I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if I  can get it all back in the original box.  
Shipping will be $25 - $45 depending on where you are located.   22 pound box.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Shipping is $20 (actually about $27, but I am absorbing $7 of it); The package weights 21 pounds, and this is FedEx ground. This is the most economical my shipping department could find. If you can find a cheaper method of shipping, that is great with me, and I can ship it whatever method is best for you.
This is the Kickstarter Second Edition, which includes the minis. The game is still in the original, un-opened shipping carton.</notes>

    <notes>This is the English Kickstarter 2nd printing with the Solo Scenarios booklet and the Character Standees add-on.
Condition: shrink-wrapped and in its original packaging (thick sheets of sturdy foam). The Solo Scenarios booklet is sealed inside the core game box. The Character Standees card is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;standalone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; with no packaging of its own (that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how it was originally distributed).
Shipping within Germany: 16.50 Euros [1] 
Shipping inside the EU (excl. Germany): 34 Euros [2]
[1] = https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/preise/preise-national.html
[2] = https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/preise/preise-international.html
The package weighs (according to my scale) precisely 10kg (the box says 9.9kg!), which puts it in a more expensive shipping category than it would be if it were only a few grams lighter :/. If the scale at the post office measures it as less than 10kg, i will of course refund any shipping price difference (7 Euros within Germany and 11 Euros to all other EU countries). Unfortunately, i won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know that until the box is shipped.
Pickup from Geltendorf, Germany can be arranged, but only by car (i live too far from the train to carry it there by foot, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably too heavy for you to pick up by bicycle!). If you do so, in addition to the saved shipping costs, i will reduce the price by 10 Euros.</notes>

    <notes>My wife and I accidentally purchased two copies of the recently released 2nd printing, and cannot return the extra (bought from online).  New-in-shrink, and selling at a discount, as we want to get rid of it - no use for a second copy.  Our over-eagerness at getting this title is your gain!
I accept PayPal and ship within 24 hours of receipt of payment.  Buyer pays exact shipping cost; I use the lowest cost trackable and insurable option among UPS, USPS, and FedEx.  I also offer local pickup.
Note that the games are currently being shipped to me, with both deliveries anticipated on Tuesday, January 23.  I should therefore be able to ship out as of January 24.</notes>

    <notes>Second Printing of Gloomhaven Kickstarter. Game is unplayed, but open and punched.  I will put trays in ziplock bags to prevent too much mixing of components in the box during shipping.
Includes fully assembled Broken token organizer, a sinister fish games removable sticker set and A file folder to hold the map tiles.  I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t feel like the broken token did a good job of managing the tiles or the second printing dials.   
Note: There is absolutely no way to fit everything in the box at once with the broken token organizer, so the file folder is separate.

    <notes>Includes Broken Token insert.  Shipping included.
Looking to sell my copy of Gloomhaven with some extras. It has been played solo, but is still in very good to excellent condition. It just wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me. There is a ding on one of the top corners of the box due to shipping. It did not affect any of the game contents.
None of the stickers or tracking pads were used. All unlock-able characters are still sealed. Only characters used were the Brute and Spellweaver.
The game also contains:
Solo scenario booklet from the kickstarter
Character standees from the kickstarter
Sinister Fish removable stickers (unused)
Broken token insert that is fully assembled and the contents are organized
Shipping included.  Will ship in original shipping package.</notes>

Brand New. Never opened.
Reason for selling:
Pre-ordered the second print, and my wife surprised me with a copy before the pre-ordered arrived. Couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t cancel the pre-order without taking a penalty so I kept it. Selling it now. This is still in the pre-order shipping box.</notes>

Reusable stickers by Sinister Fish games also included.
I have not played the game but all components including cards, map tiles etc have been checked and everything is there and in perfect condition.
I have not opened or checked any of the legacy components, so everything that has a seal on it is unopened.

    <notes>Bought this from Amazon a few weeks ago.  Punched everything.    Played the 1st scenario twice now in two weeks and have been looking at my bookshelf with all my other games and really want to play something else.
Really appreciate this game and the tactical combat‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just too long and will take too much time when I have so many other games.
So, everything is punched.   Opened only 2 of the character boxes so those are good.  Never used any stickers.   Town record not opened.    Everything in great shape.    No box inserts but I will bubble wrap and use ziplocks for everything.
$15 shipping West of the Mississippi.   
$30 shipping East of the Mississippi.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Bought this few weeks ago. Punched everything. After getting into the rules I played 3 scenarios. 
I appreciate this game and the tactical combat‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just too long and will take too much time, what I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expected.
So, everything is punched and well assorted.
Opened only 2 of the character boxes (Scoundrel and Brut) those are still in very good condition. The map-board and/or any stickers are not used. No sealed envelope or Town record was opened. Everything in great shape. No third party box insert.</notes>

    <notes>2nd edition retail version.  This has been opened and the cardboard sheets have been punched out and organized.  However, the cards are still shrinkwrapped, the stickers are not used (map or card stickers), everything sealed is still sealed and the entire game is in unplayed, like new condition from smoke free home.  We just aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t going to get this massive game to the table here.  So, should be an excellent buying option for someone who is looking to get started on this game campaign.  Buyer to pay paypal fee and  shipping (likely UPS or FedEx Ground will be cheapest).  Ships from NJ.</notes>

    <notes>This is the second printing.
Includes Removable Sticker Set.
Played twice but too heavy for my group. Only 3 or 4 of the vinyl stickers were used, but they are removable so you can remove them if you want to (there isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t much need since it is the same stickers you would place after playing the first 3 scenarios anyway). 
No components were ripped, and no permanent stickers were used. 
Ships from 70003 
Box is roughly 18 in x 13.5 in x 11 in and weighs 22 lbs
Go to USPS and UPS websites to calculate the postage.
UPS generally seems to be cheaper overall, it seems to range between $28 and $47 depending on the location.
Message me if you have any questions.

    <notes>Brand new, never been played ($200 + shipping).
Solo scenarios pack included ($10 value).
Comes with brand new dungeon saga doors pack ($20 value)
I punched out and organized everything into plano storage boxes ($30 value) w/ labels, so there is no original insert (most throw it away). That took close to 4 hours. Everything is very well organized and fits into the box.
I have only opened the starting classes so most of it is UNTOUCHED.
Cards are still in original sleeves.
The game is ready to play with no time needed to organize.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only selling because I have no time to play it. I got it in the second printing from Kickstarter. Nothing is wrong with it.
Shipping from Oklahoma.</notes>

    <notes>I purchased Gloomhaven for solo play, played 10 or so scenarios, and just decided it wasn‚Äôt for me. The price is so low because I have placed some stickers on the map, made several markings on the map, and hand modified (very small modifications, changing a 15 to 12 for example) several of the cards to bring them into alignment with the second edition. I HAVE NOT destroyed any of the cards, or stickered any cards with enchantments. All content is accounted for and well-cared for. I am happy to include the custom storage solution I devised with a nice Plano box. 
I know this isn‚Äôt for everyone, but it you would like to get into Gloomhaven at a low price I am happy to provide. There are very nice web tools that manage the map portion of the game that could be used in place of mine, or the stickers could be taken off and the reusable sticker pack purchased and used. Please let me know if you‚Äôd like any more info or pictures.
I live in the Boston area, so local would be best due to the HUGE box. If there is interest I am happy to discuss shipping options as well.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This copy is less than a week old and all of the components are in excellent condition. Game has been opened and set up once, and played very carefully 3 times - the vast majority of components have never been used, and those that have been are carefully returned to the packaging in the original box layout. Any punched-out counters, obstacles, and monsters have been placed within a plastic multi-compartment craft organiser, which I will include with the game. The campaign book is untouched, and there are just 8 stickers placed on the map board (for the opening few scenarios). The campaign game can be played from the beginning as-new.
Reason for selling - simply the time commitment required to engage properly with this massive game. It clearly won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get the kind of play that I expected and I want to pass it on to someone who will enjoy it properly.
Can possibly meet (this thing is over 9kg of game!) or arrange collection in Ireland, otherwise can safely re-package and post for additional P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P cost (still have a very well-reinforced box to place everything in)</notes>

    <notes>Description: Gloomhaven 2nd printing. Note that from the top view the upper right corner of the box has compression damage from shipping. The box is intact and the contents are unaffected, but the outer box dox have damage from shipping.
Shipping Weight:  22  lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

The original plastic stickers that hold the top of the box to the bottom have been peeled off, but all components are inside and all punch boards have not been punched.  The bottom of the box is a little scratched due to sliding the box on the floor.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in perfect condition and the only reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it is to have extra money for when I go to school.</notes>

    <notes>[b]Game #8148 of the Kickstarter Edition English Second Printing with character minis and standees, and approximately $30 worth of add-ons. [/b]
Ships in original numbered packaging, with all original packing materials. Voids filled to ensure safety in shipping. Item will be insured to full purchase value.
I have played the first scenario, and the components for that have been punched and bagged. (This will actually make it easier for you to jump right in. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also included a Getting Started printout found on BGG.) Cards used in the first scenario are sleeved in FFG premium sleeves (4 hero and 6 enemy battle decks).
The remaining 98% of the game is unpunched, unopened, and like new. Original insert and original foam-core separators included and everything is in its place. 
Includes separate item: Removable Stickers, three (of over 100) of which have been placed and carefully replaced on the sticker sheet, and can be used again. The second, permanent sticker sheet (included with the base game) is untouched. The board is perfectly clean and like new.
Also includes separate item: Solo Scenarios

Not in shrink, but never played. Cards still include shrink. All boxes unopened. Game box bottom portion does come with a couple split corners, although it has not come apart to the ends of the corners. It came like this to me and it was probably damaged throught the shipping process due to the box being crammed with everything. Photos are above.
Comes with Broken Token insert, not assembled and unopened. Comes with Gloomhaven reusable sticker set, unopened. Comes with 2nd edition upgrade kit, with solo scenarios, new health/ experience dials, and 2nd edition rules, all not opened.

There is a torn corner on the box and some of the item cards are dented*; this does not affect gameplay.  Game has been opened and played but no legacy elements have been affected; e.g. the only sticker applied is the first one that the rulebook has you apply when starting a new campaign.
* When taking the photos I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find the affected item cards but did find an example of dented personal quest cards.  As these are drawn in secret they are technically marked but I find it unlikely that play will be affected due to the nature of the game.  The cards were hard to photograph so I hope the affected area is clearly presented.</notes>

    <notes>This purchase is AS IS. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best for someone that wants to dip their toe into the Gloomhaven water for much less than full price.
This game was played for about 20 hours. It has been written on, stickered, and cards have been removed. I would say we went through roughly 10% of the content, which means a lot of it is intact and untouched. I have done my best to organize it, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure you will need to go through and come up with your own system.
Shipping will be $20 to any US address.
GeekMail me with any questions. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be glad to answer them.</notes>

    <notes>Tiny spoiler
The difference between this copy and a new one is:
Played the campaign twice. Few stickers and some sheets were used (see pictures)
Giving the fact that this game is huge, I would say this won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make much difference. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s why I list it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Some of my 3d print storage stuff and a GMT counter box are included.
Shipping:
UPS or USPS. 
The game is heavy and I am not sure how much exactly is the shipping fee. However, I guarantee that I will use the cheapest option ($25-30 maybe?).</notes>

    <notes>This listing includes:
*Gloomhaven core game
*Solo Scenarios booklet
*ASSEMBLED Broken Token insert
*TONS of sleeves. Frequently used cards are sleeved, some other less frequently used cards are sleeved, and an additional ~100-200 are included just in case you need more.
*3D printed standee bases in three colors
*~100 mini d6 dice to fit in standee bases for tracking enemy health
*Reusable sticker set
*Accordion binder with map tiles organized
Game has been played ~10 times but is in excellent condition (sleeved). NO Permanent changes have been made to the game with ONE EXCEPTION: One envelope was opened and the sticker inside added to the main board. This is not a major spoiler and no marks were made to the sticker once applied. ALL components present with the exception of one player aid card which is missing. Some reusable (and removable) stickers may be on the board or on character cards. I have attempted to reset the characters into their boxes, but may have missed a few enhancement stickers.
Buyer pays shipping. Before purchasing, please be aware that this is a giant _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; heavy game. Local pickup is available in the South or East Atlanta areas. Occasionally, I make it up to the Chattanooga area.</notes>

    <notes>Played once. Version with hero miniatures, solo scenarios included, mint condition and all components nicely bagged - actually important for this game :) I will also throw in the official removable sticker set, so you can easily reset your campaign (the set has a couple of spaces marked on the location sheet, otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s like new), and a sizeable bunch of spare tokens/tiles and couple of miniatures.

    <notes>About 15 scenarios played, some stickers placed on map, some check boxes in scenario book and on prosperity track  checked but 75% or more of game is untouched. Only played 3 of the starting characters, retirement log book is sealed, all but 2 envelopes are still sealed, and no cards have been destroyed they are all in a separate zip bag in box so game could be with a little effort reset and restarted. All components are in excellent condition. Happy to answer any questions.
The box is heavy so shipping will not be cheap probably between 20 and 35 dollars depending on distance.</notes>

    <notes>Lightly used copy of Gloomhaven. All components punched and sorted (with baggies, which will be included when shipped). 
The game has been played 2-3 times max, has some pages on party sheets/character sheets filled out. However, I will remove these prior to shipment. There are stickers on the map board associated with those scenarios, which I will leave intact in case the buyer prefers the permanent stickers. 
Most boxes have not been opened (save those needed for the first two scenarios in the campaign). 
INCLUDES: SINISTER FISH REMOVABLE/REUSABLE STICKERS
Ships from New York State - do note the weight of the box and the effect this will have on the shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>the game is unplayed and all counters are still unpunched. However, three of the advnaced characters have been opened for inspection (out of curiosity).
Within Euro-zone I do prefer payment via EU-standard-bank-transfer (SEPA, IBAN/BIC) because it has no fees and is quick and safe.
If you want to pay via PAYPAL this will normally be OK, too, but please contact me upfront and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to take over all PAYPAL fees.

    <notes>Fantastic condition!
Played the first scenario and applied the 3 setup stickers (so nothing you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do yourself) + one extra (you can quickly peel it off or leave it and treat it as the reward for the first scenario).
Only opened the 2 starting heroes - everything else is shut/locked/unpunched as when I got it, apart from some tokens which I had used in the play through.
Essentially you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting the game as if you got it new, but with 4 stickers applied and a couple tokens punched out (which happens anyway when you just lift some of these punch boards).
Postage around 20 Euro (the box is huge).

    <notes>Played it a couple of times, but selling it since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not really my kind of game.
Played the game a total of 5-6 times, got until scenario 6. Due to the fact that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a legacy-game, the board has some of the stickers (6 I think) on it. This totally not influences the gameplay at all, just wanted to make clear it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not 100% new. But everything is included and in perfect condition. And everything that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sealed from the beginning is still sealed in (like unlockable characters, enveloppes etc).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added some Plano boxes and an accordeon-binder specially to store all the small components and shorten the setup-time to the minimum.
I prefer the game to be picked up (in Dordrecht), but won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind sending it, but the shipping costs are for the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>First edition, Kickstarter copy, NO MINIS as this was a standee-only copy. I have made custom foamcore inserts for most of the components. 2 plastic trays contain the tokens, fits in the box. Large black plastic folder contains the large board pieces. Cards are sleeved, with really smart handmade laminated dividers where appropriate. I have spiral bound the adventure book with a cardboard back. Played twice. Contains the Removable Sticker Pack - 2 or 3 have been placed. Just wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t my cup of tea. Photos available upon request.

    <notes>I have a used copy of Gloomhaven I am trying to get rid of and would prefer to sell locally to avoid shipping costs. I have played 6 or so scenarios meaning there are some stickers on the map and some checkmarks in the scenario book on the ones I completed.
Of note a vast majority of the content (including stickers) went unused. Four of the main characters have been played, the rest remain untouched. I also have the broken token insert assembled, and everything punched and sorted in the game box.
None of the original components are missing. Also, as mentioned in the title, the solo scenarios are included as well.
I would prefer to sell locally but would ship if necessary. I‚Äôm located near San Jose in the Bay Area. The contents have painters tape to prevent the parts from flying around inside the box for shipping. The bottom of the box is slightly torn when it was shipped to me.
Feel free to message me with any questions, concerns or offers!</notes>

Includes solo scenarios and organization plano/deck boxes.  
Because of the size and weight of the game, shipping will be expensive.  As a result, I am setting a cap of $25 for shipping cost and will cover the rest myself. If by some miracle it ships for less than that, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund you the difference.

    <notes>English 2nd Edition KS. Includes minis. Includes solo scenarios. Includes removable sticker sheets. Includes character standees. 
NOTES: Played approximately 12 scenarios. There are a couple removable stickers on the map that can be removed. No characters have been retired. Character standees haven‚Äôt been used, but they arrived from publisher with a few less-than-stellar tokens.
SHIPPING: Shipping will be $15-20 US, prohibitively expensive anywhere else. Local pickup is fine, too, and can be arranged in SF Bay Area as well (pickup from Oakland).
NOTE EXT: This game comes with terrible card drawing luck. You will never draw your +2 when needed. You will draw a curse instead. Beware.</notes>
