   <description>Timeline: Events is a card game played using 55 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Timeline: Events can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

JFK_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s assassination, the 1st step on the moon, the last crusade ... Can you put all these events correctly on the timeline? Each player is dealt the same number of cards. At the start of the game, a card is drawn at random from the stack and is placed at the center of the table with the date showing. This is the starting point for a timeline that will be gradually completed by the players. The first player then chooses one of his cards and places it before or after the card on the initial map. The player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card is then turned over to show the date of the historical event. If it is correct, it stays in place. Otherwise, the card is discarded and the player must draw another to replace it. The more cards placed in the timeline, the harder it is to ask new without making a mistake! The first player who has no more cards wins! </notes>

JFK_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s assassination, the 1st step on the moon, the last crusade ... Can you put all these events correctly on the timeline? Each player is dealt the same number of cards. At the start of the game, a card is drawn at random from the stack and is placed at the center of the table with the date showing. This is the starting point for a timeline that will be gradually completed by the players. The first player then chooses one of his cards and places it before or after the card on the initial map. The player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card is then turned over to show the date of the historical event. If it is correct, it stays in place. Otherwise, the card is discarded and the player must draw another to replace it. The more cards placed in the timeline, the harder it is to ask new without making a mistake! The first player who has no more cards wins! </notes>

    <notes>I love this game, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it about 30 times in total, taking into consideration how many other games we played over here over the years. Now I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m moving countries and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling all my games, as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be way too expensive to take them with me.
Loving and caring new owners only, please :)</notes>
