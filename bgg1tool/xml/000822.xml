   <description>Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;First game in the Carcassonne series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Beschreibung_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Eine mittelalterliche Landschaft mit St_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;dten und Kl_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ouml;stern, Stra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;szlig;en und Wiesen. Mit Taktik und ihren Gefolgsleuten (Meeple) dehnen die Spieler in diesem raffinierten Legespiel ihren Einfluss auf die einzelnen Bereiche st_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;ndig aus.

This is one box with the base game plus the first three expansions, all in one.  Carcasonne, The River, Inns _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cathedrals (also known as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), and Traders _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Builders.
Why waste shelf space for all the individual boxes when you can have it all in one?</notes>

    <notes>This sale includes carcassonne, The River Expansion, the Inns and Cathedrals expansion, the traders and builders expansion, and the half of the King and scout expansion for Carcassonne (the other half is for Hunters and Gatherers).  All of it is packaged in the regular Carcassonne box.  The contents are like new, the box has a bit of wear on the corners.  Oh, and I marked the backs of the tiles unobtrusively so that the expansions can be easily separated out from the base game; since you draw from a cloth bag (included), that won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect game play.</notes>

    <notes>This item is NEW and still in its original shrink wrap.
Also note that this is the version that includes the River expansion in it.
Buyer pays shipping costs (choice of USPS First Class or Priority Mail.) Insurance is optional but always recommended. I will contact you with the amount but it is based on what I pay to ship the item to you plus $1 handling (to cover boxes, tape, packing peanuts, and so on.) I do not believe in overcharging for shipping.
PA Residents will be charged 6% sales tax.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to order something I do not currently have listed as I can special order a variety of BGG favorites and provide them to you at a great discount.
I usually have the expansions for this game available for purchase as well, just ask.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 170)
Type: Map building 
Number of players: 2 - 5
Age of players: 8+
Length: 60 minutes
A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters, and in the fields. The skill of the players to develop the area will determine who is victorious.
Special rules for the 12 river tiles: Remove the special starting tile from the game. Instead, begin the game by laying the spring that starts the river. Set aside the lake tile and schuffle the remaining 10 river tiles face down and draw from these before drawing from the tiles from the normal game. These tiles are played and followers may be played as in the normal game with one exception: a river tile may not be placed so that the river makes a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;U_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; turn. Followers may not be placed on rivers. Once these 10 river tiles have been played, the next player plays the lake and then play continues with the normal tiles.

Parcel Post: ~$6
p.s. CD-ROM in photo is for size comparison.
I also currently have the Traders _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Builders expansion for sale for $8.95.  If I still have it, just add $2 for shipping if you want it.</notes>

    <notes>New/sealed item! Fast shipping! Pay via paypal to maydaygames@gmail.com or save 2% by paying to existingfunds@sphiatt.com instead with existing paypal funds.
Buyer to pay just $9.95 shipping!
Yes we can combine orders at significant shipping discounts.
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Combined shipping works as follows for domestic (48 lower states) orders:
Highest price shipping item: Full shipping cost
2nd-4th highest priced items: 50% off shipping cost for each of these items.
5th-10th highest priced shipping items: 60% off shipping costs for each of these items.
11th+ highest priced shipping items: 75% off shipping for all the rest of the items.
As an example say you purchased 15 games, 3 of them with $10 shipping, 5 of them with $8 shipping and 7 of them with $4 shipping. The total shipping for the 15 items would be:
Full shipping on the first item: $10.00
50% off shipping on items 2-4: $14.00 (50% off $10, $10 and $8, the next highest shipping cost items)
60% off shipping on items 5-10: $14.40 (60% off of 3 items at $8 shipping and 3 more items at $4 shipping = $36)
75% off shipping on items 11-15: $4.00 (75% off 4 items at $4)
Total shipping on these 15 items then would be $10+$14+$14.40 + $4 = $42.40 shipping. This is just an example and your results will vary depending on what you buy of course!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 170)
Type: Map building 
Number of players: 2 - 5
Age of players: 8+
Length: 60 minutes
Game Description: 
A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters, and in the fields. The skill of the players to develop the area will determine who is victorious.
Special rules for the 12 river tiles: Remove the special starting tile from the game. Instead, begin the game by laying the spring that starts the river. Set aside the lake tile and schuffle the remaining 10 river tiles face down and draw from these before drawing from the tiles from the normal game. These tiles are played and followers may be played as in the normal game with one exception: a river tile may not be placed so that the river makes a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;U_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; turn. Followers may not be placed on rivers. Once these 10 river tiles have been played, the next player plays the lake and then play continues with the normal tiles.</notes>

**
Type: Map building 
Number of players: 2 - 5
Age of players: 8+
Length: 60 minutes
Game Description: 
A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters, and in the fields. The skill of the players to develop the area will determine who is victorious.
Special rules for the 12 river tiles: Remove the special starting tile from the game. Instead, begin the game by laying the spring that starts the river. Set aside the lake tile and schuffle the remaining 10 river tiles face down and draw from these before drawing from the tiles from the normal game. These tiles are played and followers may be played as in the normal game with one exception: a river tile may not be placed so that the river makes a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;U_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; turn. Followers may not be placed on rivers. Once these 10 river tiles have been played, the next player plays the lake and then play continues with the normal tiles.
Big Box Carcassonne 2:
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 8++
Length: 45-60 minutes
Game Description: 
This Big Box is the same size of the previous, but with a slightly different component mix. Thus, it has a box liner designed with spaces for all the components.

The components, if purchased separately would cost over $100!

    <notes>Condition of the game:
Materials in box in good condition but
- missing starting piece (possible to print out or ask at Hans im Glück)
- box with wear and tear, also signature at the head of the box with ball pen
So perhaps you need spares for your Carcassonne or you want to craft own expansions with the pieces or you are not demanding with the condition of game.</notes>

The game is in excellent condition. All of the pieces and cards are in pristine condition. The box is also structurally sound. My wife and I now play the game on our iPhones (not the same, I know, but it means we rarely take out the board game itself).
I am happy to ship however the buyer would like.</notes>

Carcassonne:
 
A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters, and in the fields. The skill of the players to develop the area will determine who is victorious.
 
Carcassonne: Big Box 3:
 
This new Big Box contains the base game, plus the most popular of the expansions: Inns _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cathedrals, Traders and Builders, Princess _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dragon, Abbey _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mayor, and Bridges, Castles, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bazaars.

    <notes>Item Name: Carcassonne
Description: Carcassonne game mint, saled from Rio Grande games. Shrink wrap has two small tears, but is intact. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also add in the Traders _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Builders expansion for $6 with no additional shipping charges.
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Description:
A clever tile-laying game. The southern French city of Carcassonne is famous for its unique Roman and Medieval fortifications. The players develop the area around Carcassonne and deploy their followers on the roads, in the cities, in the cloisters, and in the fields. The skill of the players to develop the area will determine who is victorious.
Special rules for the 12 river tiles: Remove the special starting tile from the game. Instead, begin the game by laying the spring that starts the river. Set aside the lake tile and schuffle the remaining 10 river tiles face down and draw from these before drawing from the tiles from the normal game. These tiles are played and followers may be played as in the normal game with one exception: a river tile may not be placed so that the river makes a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;U_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; turn. Followers may not be placed on rivers. Once these 10 river tiles have been played, the next player plays the lake and then play continues with the normal tiles.
 
Components:
72 Land Tiles
40 Followers (8 × 5 Colors)
1 Scoring Track
1 Rule Booklet
The River Expansion is now included with the Base Game (12 River Tiles)

    <notes>Item Name: Carcassonne
Description: Carcassonne from Rio Grande. Box has shelf wear, but components are in great shape. This version includes the River Expansion.
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Chinese fake version including the River expansion. I bought it before I got into the hobby and had no idea about the very existence of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fake_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games. Nevertheless, the components are complete (except for the original English rulebook) and have pretty good quality.
I will sell only when your entire order is more than $25. Add more games to fill your order. Ships from 48105. Trade proposal is welcome.</notes>

    <notes>It is with some regret that I sell carcassonne with inns and cathedrals and traders and builders included in the box. 
This was our second board game ever. We bought it at Barnes and Noble at the mall. Battle Line was our first. I think I might have bought Battle Line on eBay due to an advertisement at a video game website maybe mmorpg.com
I guess the only direction this runs is forward. We can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be who we were, but this game has been good to us.
For $5 more we will include the boxes to traders and inns, but the shipping price could be raised due to including them.</notes>

    <notes>This item is actually Like New except for one thing: the 5 optional Abbots are not included. The shrink wrap is *open* on one end (but not gone), and the game is unpunched and unplayed. The River is included. I carefully removed the Abbots, gently replaced everything else back in the box, and carefully slid the box back inside the original shrink wrap. So if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care about the optional Abbots, this is a pristine, beautiful example of a 40-meeple Carcassonne base game plus The River, in the new artwork style, for $12 plus shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Comes with River and Abbot expansions in the box.  Components are in excellent condition, but box has a bit on wear such as corner whitening.  Most noticeably, there is a cut that goes partially through one edge of the box lid.  I received it like this in-shrink, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some weird packaging/manufacturing defect, but it never really bothered me.
Buyer pays shipping.  PM me with a zip code for a shipping estimate, I have various shipping discounts, and the box is light, so I can ship it pretty cheaply ($6-8).</notes>

    <notes>Game has been opened and punched. Played twice, items are in excellent condition.  Will only ship to United States. Typically ships via USPS flat rate boxes (13.50), unless local enough for regional mailer box. If purchasing more than one game, a bigger box is often cheaper with UPS, which has ranged from 20-35 dollars depending on box size and distance.
