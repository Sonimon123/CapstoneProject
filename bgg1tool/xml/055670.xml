   <description>At the end of the 17th century, Macao _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the mysterious port city on the southern coast of China _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; is a Portuguese trading post in the Far East. The players take on the role of energetic and daring adventurers. Many exciting tasks and challenges await the players, whether they are a captain, governor, craftsman, or scholar. Those who chose the wisest course of action and have the best overall strategy will earn the most prestige at the end._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Macao lasts twelve rounds, and in each round players select one new card from a display specific to that round, two of which were revealed at the start of the game and others that were revealed only at the start of the round. The deck of 96 cards includes all sorts of special abilities, with the more powerful actions costing more resources to put into play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One player rolls six different-colored dice, then each player selects two of those dice (possibly the same ones chosen by opponents), then places cubes equal to the number and color of the two dice on a personalized _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ship's wheel._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; For example, if a player chooses the blue die that shows a 5, he places five blue cubes on the ship's wheel position five spots away from the current round. (A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao. Whoever has the most points at the end of twelve rounds wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Macao is number 13 in the alea big box series, with an estimated difficulty on the alea scale of 6/10._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 409)
 
Macao, the mysterious harbor city on the south coast of China, is the Portuguese trading center in the far east at the end of the 17th century. The players take on the roles of the energetic adventurers who sought their fortunes in Macao. Whether as captain or governor, as craftsman or scholar, numerous exciting functions are offered the players. Who will use his various possible actions the wisest? Who will have the best plan and can acquire the most prestige by the end of the game? </notes>

    <notes>Brand new, still sealed, Rio Grande Games edition.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $6.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO409)
Macao, the mysterious harbor city on the south coast of China, is the Portuguese trading center in the far east at the end of the 17th century. The players take on the roles of the energetic adventurers who sought their fortunes in Macao. Whether as captain or governor, as craftsman or scholar, numerous exciting functions are offered the players. Who will use his various possible actions the wisest? Who will have the best plan and can acquire the most prestige by the end of the game? </notes>

Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

    <notes>For sale here is well-cared for, just barely used copy of Macao, published by alea/Rio Grande Games.
The condition is as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as possible. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played only four two-player games with this copy, so only half of the player boards have ever been out of the box. The box top still has the shrink wrap over it (slit so that it can be opened), and the game has been in an enclosed storage cabinet out of the light and air for the entire time I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve owned it (apart from those four plays). All components are present and in as-new condition—assuming that rolling the dice a few times hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worn them down to any noticeable degree.
I prefer to ship via USPS 2-day Priority Mail. This game is going to require a large Flat Rate box. I tried pricing it for shipment in a box of my own, but in this case (due to size and weight) that comes out to be more expensive than the flat rate pricing. As an estimate, sending the game from Pennsylvania to California would cost around $12.50. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not marking up the shipping charge; I will only charge the buyer the actual _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;online price_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
As noted, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to accept payment via PayPal or Google Wallet. If you have alternate payment or shipping proposal, feel free to ask.</notes>

    <notes>Macao is a great game that is in As New condition and has been played about 10 times only. Now that the children have left home it gets little play. So snap up a bargain.

    <notes>English edition. In very good condition. For full and complete disclosure, you can feel an indentation in the bottom left corner (on the back). There is one tiny little crinkle on the box too. All of this was like this when purchased new and sealed. Alea boxes are just susceptible to this.
The game is complete. Everything is in there. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve even thrown in a small dice bag to help randomize the tiles.
USPS Priority Shipping will be $12 in the CONUS.

    <notes>Almost Very Good condition. This is a really great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much these days. All of the game components (cards, counters, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. The box has very slight scuffing on the corners but barely noticeable. The cards are crisp and clean with very slight edge discolouration, again barely noticeable. My wife and I played this but always on a green baize cloth and we look after our games. The punched counters have been carefully separated, trimmed, sorted and bagged. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game as a gift.

Condition - New in shrink-wrap
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

In excellent, complete condition, played only a couple of times.
The rule book has a very slight curling of the bottom right edge, as seen in the photo. This is its original condition and not the result of mishandling.
Comes from a smoke-free home where board games are treasured.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.  
No longer in shrink but unpunched and unplayed.  The box top has some scratches on it.

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your item(s) in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
Please send a USPS money order (safest possible $$ transfer) to me.
Alternatively,
Please send an online Amazon gift card (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LLIKVU) to me.
(-- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me)
When placing the order, LMK if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but theoretically there is some risk).
Important: See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more details on shipping and payment options (especially if you are an international buyer).</notes>

    <notes>Selling this off cheaply as I just want the space back in my dining room. 
This is the German First Edition. I bought this at Essen the year it was released. I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wait for the English version to be released so I bought the German edition and did a translation when I got home.  I now own an English copy. 
It is heavily language independent game, all the cards and rules are in German, although a copy of my own English translation of the rules and cards is in the box. 
The game is in good condition, all the cards and parts are in excellent condition, the box is worn around the edges. You can see the wear around the edges of the box in the picture. 
Shipping to the UK will be £3.50. Please contact me for shipping costs to Europe as it varies from country to country.</notes>

    <notes>Full disclosure: A 10th anniversary edition is forthcoming.  But, that could be a year or more away.
My wife and I love this game so much that we owned 3 copies.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m down to 2 and selling 1 that is brand new.
This is a New In Shrink (NIS) copy of the game.  Prefer to use USPS Priority.  Flat-rate if it makes sense.</notes>

    <notes>One red cube (of 50) was missing, so we have provided a plastic substitute cube.  The cubes are not selected randomly, so this should have zero effect on game play even if you use all 50 cubes (which seems highly unlikely).  Rulebook is crinkled.  Remaining components are in excellent condition.  Box is in good to very good condition with some wear and a few dings.</notes>
