   <description>In Thunderstone: Heart of Doom, you had a chance to face Doom's very heart, the eighth Thunderstone, and defeat the ancient evil _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but winning that battle had unexpected consequences. It banished Doom, but also freed him to visit other worlds, so you advanced to the next world with him._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin, which is fully compatible with all previous Thunderstone offerings, is the next stop in your adventure. In Thunderstone Advance you build your party of heroes to defeat the dreaded Thunderstone Bearers in their dungeons or wilderness. The player who defeats the most valuable monsters will win the day, but beware _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; those monsters have all-new tricks up their sleeves, and victory will not come easy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin includes new rules, all new cards in new card frames, and a new village and dungeon board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Thunderstone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Thunderstone: Starter Set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Opened and played once, in excellent condition. All cards sleeved, and includes the Avataars expansion that was a giveaway on day of purchase.  Also includes a brand spanking new replacement board since the original had some glue problems.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $8.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

In Thunderstone: Heart of Doom, you had a chance to face Doom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very heart, the eighth Thunderstone, and defeat the ancient evil - but winning that battle had unexpected consequences. It banished Doom, but also freed him to visit other worlds, so you advanced to the next world with him. </notes>

In Thunderstone: Heart of Doom, you had a chance to face Doom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very heart, the eighth Thunderstone, and defeat the ancient evil - but winning that battle had unexpected consequences. It banished Doom, but also freed him to visit other worlds, so you advanced to the next world with him.

    <notes>Comes from a non-smoking/pet-free house.
Game has only been played once and is in excellent condition, the box barely even shows signs of wear. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very meticulous about taking care of my games. Even the cards were sleeved the one time I did play it so they are in almost brand-new condition. I did remove the sleeves though when I decided to sell.
Shipping will be a flat cost of $10, I use USPS and due to the ever-increasing cost of shipping these days, I can only deliver to the continental US. I apologize to everyone outside of that zone, it is simply too prohibitive to ship anywhere else.</notes>

    <notes>This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much. All of the game components (cards, counters, rules, player aids etc) are in super condition. 
Note: one corner of the box base was slightly damaged when I received the game - I have reduced my asking price accordingly. 
I only played the game solitaire a few times, which worked well. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.
I also have Thunderstone Advance - Caverns of Bane expansion for sale.

The sets are mixed together, and can be shipped with or without all boxes.  All sets will fit into 2-3 of the large Thunderstone boxes, so I can just sent 2-3 boxes of your choice to save on shipping.  Beware - shipping will be quite expensive, as there are a LOT of cards in the set!
All sets are like new - removed from shrink and sorted, but only played a handful of times.</notes>

    <notes>Description: Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin complete and in excellent shape
Shipping Weight:  6 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Moving overseas, so selling off some of my games collection.
TBH, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even recall playing this. I think I have opened it, sorted out the cards, then has been left unplayed on my shelf. So pretty much mint condition
I can give discounts on multiple items.
I live in London, so pick up is possible.

    <notes>This is for a complete set of Thunderstone Advance fully sleeved and in excellent condition. I am the original owner and it has been sleeved since the day I removed the shrink. 
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s currently setup epic style, and I have half of the cards stored in the spare boxes. The remaining are considered my play set and are in deck boxes by color for easy setup. However, both the stored and play sets are currently sorted so if Epic isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t your preference, it can be undone with a small amount of work.
Truly, I adore this game and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to part with it. However, due to various circumstances it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best to go to another loving home.
Includes:
Towers of Ruin
Starter Set
Roots of Corruption
Caverns of Bane
Worlds Collide
Into the Abyss
Numenera
Avatars
Fantasy Flight premium sleeves for all 2100+ cards (This took me hours. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll thank me for all that work!)
Deckboxes for the different card types (only the play set, however. See details above. I can include deck boxes to cover the entire game for an additional $20)
I assume the buyer will want all of the original boxes and inserts. As such, I estimate the shipping will be in the $30-$40 range to any US state for this massive beast.
If you have any questions, please let me know!</notes>
