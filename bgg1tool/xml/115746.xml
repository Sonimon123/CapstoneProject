   <description>In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>English version.
All items are new and in shrink if so delivered by the producer.
All items are really on stock. No fake set-up here. No Order on demand.
International Customers, our precise shipping costs are as follows:
DHL International Shipping: Zone 1 (Mostly Europe): 15,00€+1,00€ per two kilos
Shipping costs can vary greatly after that and have to be asked for individually.
We ship only fully insured. So ordering only a small pocket game or anything very low priced may come out to be very uneconomical.
Methods of payment:
-You can always pick the game up at our storage location :-)
-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use paypal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)
Für unsere deutschsprachigen Kunden:
Sie können uns für alle Fragen gerne telefonisch kontaktieren:
Tel.: 0201-786877
Die Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschlands betragen 5,- Euro (inkl. 19% Mwst.). Ab 100€ versenden wir innerhalb Deutschlands Versandkostenfrei.
Alle Preise enthalten die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer in Höhe von 19%.
Bezahlmöglichkeiten für Kunden innerhalb Deutschlands:
- Alle Kreditkarten willkommen !
- Paypal
- Vorkasse
- Rechnung (Nicht für Erstbesteller, wir behalten uns vor die Zahlungsmöglichkeit per Rechnung von Fall zu Fall neu zu bewerten !)
 
Alternativ ist natürlich auch eine Abholung mit Bar-, EC-, oder Kreditkartenzahlung in unserem Lager möglich. (Im Geschäft wird neben Brettspielen auch eine üppige Auswahl an Rollenspielen angeboten.)

Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung - wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre - zurückzuführen ist. 
Im Übrigen können Sie die Wertersatzpflicht vermeiden, 
indem Sie die Sache nicht wie ein Eigentümer in Gebrauch nehmen und alles unterlassen, was deren Wert beeinträchtigt. 
Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, w
enn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt,
oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung,
oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. 
Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. 
Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. 
Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung erfüllen.

    <notes>Description: 
The WAR OF THE RING (2nd Edition) is a grand strategy board game that allows its players to immerse themselves in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien’s THE LORD OF THE RINGS™ and experience its epic action, dramatic conflict, and memorable characters.
As the Free Peoples player you command the proud hosts of the most important kingdoms of the Third Age. From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.
Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.
As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.
This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age...
War of the Ring is a game for two to four players, based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.
The players take part in the struggle of the armies of the Free Peoples and the heroic Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring against the dark host of the Shadow and the powerful Minions of the Dark Lord.
In a two-players game, each opponent will lead either the Free Peoples or the armies of the Shadow, while in a three- or four-players game, the players will be organized in two team, each team controlling either faction.
In each game of War of the Ring, the player controlling the Shadow attempts to use his superior military power to conquer Middle-earth.
At his command gather Sauron’s legions of Orcs and Trolls, the forces of the wizard Saruman, and the hosts of the Southrons and Easterlings, set to bring darkness over the West.
Against this onslaught, the Free Peoples player leads an allegiance of Elves, Dwarves, the riders of Rohan, men of Gondor, and men from the North—a fragile union trying to defend the last free realms of Middle-earth, and to gain precious time to allow the success of the Quest of the Ring-bearers.
While armies clash, the nine Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring travel towards the very heart of the domains of the Dark Lord—Mount Doom—to destroy the One Ring in the Mountain of Fire.
Controlled by the Free Peoples player, the Fellowship is his true chance of winning, as the military forces of the Shadow will be vanquished together with their master if the Ring is undone. But the Quest is fraught with ever greater perils, as the Darkness falls over Middle-earth…
In the end, one side will emerge victorious.
If the Shadow conquers enough of its enemies’ cities and strongholds, or if the Ring-bearers fail and are corrupted, Darkness will triumph.
If the Fellowship succeeds in destroying the Ring before this happens, or the armies of the Free Peoples succeed in turning the tide and conquering the enemy’s strongholds themselves, the fall of the Dark Lord is at hand…

    <notes>One of my favorite games (this is a second copy) -- If you want a deep and epic 2 player game then look no further. Game is complete and box is in good condition. Most components are unpunched/unbagged! However, there is slight damage to the board in the form of some small blemishes on the map , which is why I have listed this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Acceptable._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; But nothing that affects the playibility in any way whatsoever or is even really that noticeable when you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the heat of the struggle for Middle Earth, so this is a great chance to get the game at a discount if cosmetic blemishes do not bother you. Only buy if you are OK with this!
Shipping to U.S. only, shipping and handling will be $15.95. Payment via PayPal only.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>The WAR OF THE RING (2nd Edition) is a grand strategy board game that allows its players to immerse themselves in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien’s THE LORD OF THE RINGS™ and experience its epic action, dramatic conflict, and memorable characters.
 As the Free Peoples player you command the proud hosts of the most important kingdoms of the Third Age. From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.
 Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.
 As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.
 This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age...
 War of the Ring is a game for two to four players, based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.
 The players take part in the struggle of the armies of the Free Peoples and the heroic Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring against the dark host of the Shadow and the powerful Minions of the Dark Lord.
 In a two-players game, each opponent will lead either the Free Peoples or the armies of the Shadow, while in a three- or four-players game, the players will be organized in two team, each team controlling either faction.
 In each game of War of the Ring, the player controlling the Shadow attempts to use his superior military power to conquer Middle-earth.
 At his command gather Sauron’s legions of Orcs and Trolls, the forces of the wizard Saruman, and the hosts of the Southrons and Easterlings, set to bring darkness over the West.
 Against this onslaught, the Free Peoples player leads an allegiance of Elves, Dwarves, the riders of Rohan, men of Gondor, and men from the North—a fragile union trying to defend the last free realms of Middle-earth, and to gain precious time to allow the success of the Quest of the Ring-bearers.
 While armies clash, the nine Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring travel towards the very heart of the domains of the Dark Lord—Mount Doom—to destroy the One Ring in the Mountain of Fire.
 Controlled by the Free Peoples player, the Fellowship is his true chance of winning, as the military forces of the Shadow will be vanquished together with their master if the Ring is undone. But the Quest is fraught with ever greater perils, as the Darkness falls over Middle-earth…
In the end, one side will emerge victorious.
 If the Shadow conquers enough of its enemies’ cities and strongholds, or if the Ring-bearers fail and are corrupted, Darkness will triumph.
 If the Fellowship succeeds in destroying the Ring before this happens, or the armies of the Free Peoples succeed in turning the tide and conquering the enemy’s strongholds themselves, the fall of the Dark Lord is at hand…

    <notes>I am selling my copy of War of the Ring (Second Edition), Lords of Middle Earth expansion, and the Treebeard promo.  I bought the game a few years ago, but cannot get it to the table.  I put the condition in Very Good because I have thrown away the insert, since with the expansion, I could not fit it it all in the box.  I have purchased a Plano box to store various components, and a small dice bag for the Hunt tokens.  I have pictures available.  The game has only been played one or two times.  To avoid high shipping cost, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to keep the sale in the Twin Cities area of MN.  I can ship it, but that will likely increase the price by $20-30 for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Complete copy of the War of the Ring Second Edition.  One panel on the left side of the board was split off cleanly by the original owner (his son folded it the wrong direction).  I received in this condition and bought black linen hinge tape (for book and board game repair) and reassembled it as good as new.  When on the table, you can barely tell it it was ever damaged. 
All figures sorted and bagged by nationality.
Includes WOTR002, the tin for storing of the cards.  All cards are sleeved.
Very very very good condition.  Smoke free household.</notes>

    <notes>This game has never actually been played.  Shrink wrap was only removed to inventory the components and read the rules...I think I may have even set it up briefly to see how it looked but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it.  Game has been collecting dust on my shelf for a couple of years now.
All game contents are 100% accounted for and are also in pristine condition!
Comes from a smoke-free home!

From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth. Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom. As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies. This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age...</notes>

    <notes>In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.
The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.
Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).
Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events which could possibly have happened) which cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.</notes>

    <notes>This is a listing for my copy of War of the Ring, Second Edition.  The game includes three Plano boxes, used to hold all the miniatures and tokens included in the game.  In addition, all of the cards are sleeved with FFG Orange (Tarot) sized cards.  
The game is in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition.  The only wear on any of the components whatsoever is the outside corners of the box have lost some of their color due to regular storage and use.
I will only ship to a Paypal verified address in the CONUS and only accept payment via PayPal
Note:  Included pictures show cards being held together with rubber bands.  They have since been replaced by strips of Hugo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Amazing tape which will ship with the game.</notes>

    <notes>War of the Ring - Anniversary Edition
Copy # 1435 of 2000
New, in original packaging
Package was opened to check the contents for damage.  Some of these were shipped from the factory with scratched game boards.  This one is perfect - NO SCRATCH.
If you buy one from someone else, make sure that the board has been inspected for the factory imperfection.  THIS ONE IS VERIFIED WITH NO DAMAGED GAME BOARD.
EXTRAS - EXTRAS - 
Also included are extra miniatures.  One large 3-D miniature of Mt Doom that was specifically crafted to lay on this large game board and to become part of the battle.
Also - The two towers: Orthanc and Barad Dur (the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;eye tower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) are also represented in Miniature (see photo) and assume their place on the map to further evoke the theme and the story.
Also - 5 custom 3-D tokens to track corruption, fellowship status and victory points.  These will replace the card board chits that come with the game.

    <notes>Some light wear on the box. All components in excellent condition.
Includes Lords of Middle Earth expansion (worth about $20). I still have that box and can include it, though that will inflate the (already high) shipping cost. I recommend just packing the expansion content in the core box.
If this thing had an insert, it was probably useless and is long gone.
Estimate up to $27 shipping depending on distance from 95062 (the dimensions of this thing just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make for cheap shipping, unfortunately)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m super OCD with packaging and will do my utmost to protect the box and everything inside of it. See my ratings and trading history; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not kidding.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition, minimally painted. Includes a painted plastic mold of Mount Doom. Armies are separated in plastic bags.
The armies have all been painted to give them a two-tone look and have silver and gold bases. Please see the images for details.
Shipping:
I am happy to combine shipping on multiple items.
I can ship from both US and (if you are patient) Canada.
I will find the cheapest shipping method. Within the continental USA, this is typically Fedex. International shipping can be very expensive. 
Insurance and tracking:
I recommend paying for both of these. As a hobbyist and an individual seller, I cannot take responsibility for items that are damaged or lost in transit.</notes>

    <notes>In shrink. Due to insufficient protection in packing the upper edge of the box has a small dent where the parcel hit something in transit - looks like a common issue. It is about 0.5mm in depth and 4mm in length, but caused a light ripple on the surface f the box cover around it - see pictures.
I will surely pack it better than Ares did!</notes>

    <notes>This has been removed from shipping box, but never played.  All cards still in shrink and painted minis still in trays.
Besides the complete anniversary edition, I will also include a custom made, painted set of 15 stone composite (not 3-D printed) sculpted models for all the major stronghold locations and mountain ranges, as well as a custom made set of tracking tokens (not 3-D printed) which look like gemstones set in iron and gold broaches or pendants.
(Both the strongholds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; mountains, as well as the tracking tokens are stored separately in their own boxes.)
Inquiries for serious buyers only.   If you message me, I will be happy to send you as many photos of the game or components as you would like AND since you if have bothered to read this far then by all means we can discuss both a reduced price and a couple unnamed extras as well.  
SHIPPING NOTE:  This is an enormous and enormously heavy game, which will be shipped separately from the custom models and tracking tokens.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not wiling to risk combined shipping and potentially damaging with the game or the very nice hand painted models. 
 
PERSONAL NOTE: This was a gift to myself I bought when I turned 40, but I have yet to play it with friends, and it is too nice and LARGE to carry to game conventions. It has been sitting unplayed and opened only once to examine all the components. It still has it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s letter of authenticity.</notes>
