Bought at Christmas have read the rules but can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see myself ever playing it which is a shame as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good looking game.
happy to provide photo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.
Will let you know postage (before puchasing) if you let me know where are.

    <notes>Opened but never played.  The chits are unpunched and the cards are still sealed in plastic.  Everything looks good!  Shipping will be actual USPS, UPS or FedEx cost.  (Previous inquiries have returned a shipping quote around $16.  Could be lower if I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve overestimated the weight, in which case I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll return the difference.)  Please feel free to ask if you have any questions.

    <notes>This is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of the Tide of Iron base game - played approximately 15 times.  The game was purchased new, but on arrival it was damaged during shipping - the box has a ripped corner, but is still very serviceable.  All components are intact, present, and in excellent condition.  Game DOES NOT include the cardboard insert - it was removed to make storage of components easier.  
The game has been organized into plastic organizers (one for each nation, with one for game status markers, too) and will be included with the sale. 
This game is being sold along with several of the expansions and I will combine shipping if you purchase more than one item.  Due to the size and weight, this item will likely cost about $20.00 to ship - but a better estimate can be given prior to purchase if one is desired.
Priced to sell - should be purchased by a person wanting a players copy of this excellent game.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game plus:
Days of the Fox
Normandy
Map expansion Pack One (in base box)
Designer Series Vol. 1
The base game is missing just 2 German regular infantry figures because the pegs came off, but the expansions include more german figures so you never miss them for any given scenario. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played the base game a handful of times, Days of the Fox a couple of times and never Normandy. The boxes are all really nice with no split corners or scuffs. The card decks show no wear and are as if cut yesterday with a nice linen finish. All rulebooks and reference sheets are in great shape.
(I estimate the game materials once packed will weigh 12 to 13kg).</notes>

    <notes>CONDITION - The game is in over all excellent condition as it was only played once and the tokens are around 80% unpunched! It is missing two German regular infantry and one American infantry. I looked through the scenario book however and added up all the regular infantry needed for both sides and in one scenario the Americans need 53 units between their starting forces and their reinforcements and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s exactly what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the game so the missing figures won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect the game at all. The Germans don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come close to needing all of their regular infantry in any scenario.
*****NOTE: This game was sold to (MrTheFalcon) in the BGG VFM of 2013 and will be delivered to the Con.*****</notes>

Also includes Next Wave Rules and Scenario update booklets. Essentially everything available for the game except a few minor promos. Very well cared for; all components in like new condition.
Everything is packed into Stalingrad and FotB boxes; map boards stored in plastic file box. (I could likely get everything but the mapboards in a single box and save a bit on shipping.)  I have the original coffin box as well, but including it will substantially increase shipping. Expect about $25-30 via FedEx without the coffin box. Total weight is about 36 lbs.</notes>
