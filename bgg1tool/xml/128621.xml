   <description>In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).

Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

Also could trade for fun/fast/easy play board, dice, card games. Check out my Geek list, should be up to date, but feel free to suggest anything! :) </notes>

    <notes>This is a copy of Viticulture First Edition with the Second Edition upgrade pack fully integrated.  (All affected Visitor Cards from the First Edition have been replaced with their Second Edition versions.  6 Grande Workers are included as in the Second Edition.   The large First Edition Grape Tokens have been replaced with smaller Second Edition Grape Tokens.  Stickers have been applied to the boards to upgrade it to the Second Edition style)
The rulebook is for the First Edition, but the Second Edition rulebook can be found in the files section.  I have included a Rules Summary Sheet for the 2nd Edition.
As a bonus, the original Arboriculture Expansion (boards / cards / tokens) are also included.
All cards are sleeved.  The box has virtually no shelf/edge wear.  The components are all in great shape.
The original insert IS included and it is very functional.
The score sheet is NOT included as it has been used.
Any questions just ask.  :)</notes>

    <notes>This is not the game, but the set of 72 metal coins that can be used in Viticulture and Tuscany. I ordered a set from amazon a long while ago, hid it in a closet (as I did not have the game) and recently got the Viticulture essential edition. As I had forgotten about my previous purchase I added another set of coins to my order so that I now have a second set that I do not need. The MSRP is 25 USD so you can save a bit by getting it here.
It is new, unopened and from a cat free non-smoking household.</notes>

    <notes>This is a first edition of the game from what I can tell, as it does not have the Grande workers, but not a Kickstarter edition, as it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have any of the Kickstarter items. There are 74 1 Lira coins instead of the 78 listed in the rules, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see this affecting game play. I have not played this copy, but I might have loaned it out and it was played, so I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say for certain if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s played or not. No issues. First edition (2013) Stonemaier Games

Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from U.S.A.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and unplayed (bought on kickstarter). 
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. If you want the game to be shipped outside of the USA, please geekmail me first. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.</notes>

    <notes>This version includes the 6 grande workers. 
Game components are all in impeccable condition - game has only been played a handful of times, and has been well looked after and carefully stored. Game box has two very slightly squashed corners - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included photos below to show the condition.
I am also selling the Tuscany expansion - please see my other listing for details. 
Shipping within the UK will be £3.00 via Royal Mail. I am very happy to combine shipping on multiple items - please message me for an estimate.</notes>
