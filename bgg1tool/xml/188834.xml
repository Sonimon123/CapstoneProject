   <description>Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. The liberal team always has a majority._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>**KS edition**(with wooden placards for president and chancellor). Played once.
Flat shipping fee $13 for Continental USA. (See below for international shipping). Combined shipping available. Also available for pick up in NYC.
I accept Paypal, Venmo, Google wallet and Chase Quickpay.
Price is negotiable if you buy multiple games. 
I will consider international shipping if USPS can ship to the country. The rate would be based on the flat rate packages on USPS website (plus $3 to buy insurance if the value is bigger than $50). Shipping to China is $9/lb.</notes>

    <notes>JUST THE WOOD BOX. 
I bought this game at GenCon -love it and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to part with it, but I do not have room or need for the fancy wood box it came it. 
So, if you regret not getting the fancy wood box, buy mine! Shipping included in the price!
If this doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t not sell in a week, I will take down (9/8/16).
Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>I have a copy of the wooden box version of Secret Hitler. It has never been played and the cards are still in shrink, and wooden role tiles still in the wrap. The only wear is a small scratch on the top of the box that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only noticeable when light hits it at the right angle, otherwise you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see it. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve attached a picture to the listing.

    <notes>Game is Brand New and Sealed with All original components and pieces.
We open one sample game to take pictures and we will not send you the already open one.
Game Description:
Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it’s too late.
Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.</notes>
