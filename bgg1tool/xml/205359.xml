The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;description from the publisher_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the remains of my personal collection which I built by buying several starter sets, an entire booster box of Spirit of Rebllion, and probably 30 or so packs of Awakenings. Plus cherry picking individual cards I liked from dealers, with the purpose of making up several different deck types for casual play.
3 Legendaries (Quadjumper, Force Lightening, Blaze Malbus), over 85 Rares, over 100 Uncommons and close to (if not every) common from Awakenings and Spirit of Rebellion, with a few Heart of Empire cards as well.
Rares include 20+ characters including Jango Fett, Padme, Veers, Qui-Gon, Luminara Unduli, Aurra Sing, Leia, Snap Wexley, Juan Erso, Ackbar, General Grievous, Asajj Ventress, Unkar Plutt and more than 10 miscellaneous mooks.
If you want to bulk up your collection for trading or play purposes, this is a nice bulk lot of cards for you.
All the dice are included, and the cards were only played when sleeved so they are in great condition.
I’ll pay shipping up to $10, you pay the rest. I’m in Pennsylvania.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the entire collection. Includes at least 4 booster boxes of Awakenings, at least 2 booster boxes of Empire at War, at least 2 booster boxes of Legacies, at least 2 booster boxes of Spirit of Rebellion and 1 booster box of Way of the Force. It also includes one of each starter set so far and 2 copies of the 2-player starter set. It will also come with multiple storage boxes.  I say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;at least_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because I also purchased multiple packs throughout the time I was collecting. I have sold off about 20 cards but this collection does still include plenty of rares and super rares. All product has been opened but most of it was never played and in great condition. Shipping will be included in the price.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling all of my Star Wars: Destiny, jump right into the game with a bunch of cards and dice.  Cards were sleeved when used, so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in great shape.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed out specifically which Legendary and Rares I have.  For the cards that list multiples (e.g. Captain Phasma x3), I also have that many dice.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only listed the quantities I have of the Uncommons, Commons, and starter set cards (cards with a gray rarity color at the bottom).
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to see if this includes a particular card or have other questions regarding these, please feel free to ask.
This also comes with some of the tokens needed to play (resources, damage, etc..)
Shipping will be $16.50 anywhere in the U.S.
NOTE:  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only selling this as a lot - not parting anything out
