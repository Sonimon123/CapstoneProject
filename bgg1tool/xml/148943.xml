   <description>In Coup: Rebellion G54 (G54), the last player with influence in the game wins, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck. Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards. On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Income: Take one coin from the treasury._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When you take one of the character actions _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The last player to still have influence _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; that is, a face-down character _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; wins the game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game. This is more of a gamer's game than the original Coup as you can create a deck to increase bluffing, deduction, negotiation or luck._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

GAME OVERVIEW: [/b]
In Coup: Rebellion G54 (G54), the last player with influence in the game wins, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck. Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total.
A player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards – i.e., two face-down character cards. On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:
•Income: Take one coin from the treasury.
•Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)
When you take one of the character actions – whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s action – that character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t (or don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re out of the game.
If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.
The last player to still have influence – that is, a face-down character – wins the game!
Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game. This is more of a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game than the original Coup as you can create a deck to increase bluffing, deduction, negotiation or luck.

    <notes>Indie Boards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cards (IBCG541)
G54 is the exciting sequel to Rikki_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s award winning game, Coup. G54 is completely stand alone - Coup is not required to play nor do the two games work together. G54 uses the same lightning fast rules found in Coup - claim, counter, challenge and bluff - and then adds an exciting strategic layer via character selection. Before each game starts, five character roles are chosen randomly from 25 different cards. Each of the five characters has a unique ability - the combination of abilities and interplay between them makes each game unique. There are over 5,000 different ways to play!</notes>

    <notes>Pretty sure it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the Kickstarter edition since the box includes also the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Coup_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; promos that are announced on the KS page.
Box shows little wear. Inside everything there in great condition. Game has been played once. All the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Coup_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; related cards are still sealed.</notes>
