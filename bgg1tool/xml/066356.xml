A cave mouth leads to a maze of tunnels and chambers, and deep within this monster-infested labyrinth lurks the most terrifying creature of all: a red dragon!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player selects a hero; a rogue, thief, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Was very curious to try this one out. And in spite of the production quality and tight rule-set the co-operative nature of this game just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me. This had just two plays. Everything is sorted and bagged; insert wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t functional so I threw that away!</notes>

    <notes>All the miniatures fully painted by hand. Please check out photos here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1112995/dungeons-dragons-wrath-of-ashardalon-board-game
Price is negotiable.  Happy to consider any reasonable offers.  Also willing to consider trade offers.
Game is complete and in great condition.  Played a few times, but all components are still like new (well, except for the fact that I have painted the miniatures).  This copy came with an extra Duergar Cleric, which I have painted as well and will include. 
Shipping will be exact postage only. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing material or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;handling._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;   Insurance is optional though I strongly recommend it.
Happy to answer any questions you might have.  </notes>

    <notes>FULLY PAINTED _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; INCLUDES KOBOLD CHAMPION PROMO CARD!
This is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;buy-before-I=change-my-mind_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; listing of the Ashardalon set I have hand-painted. I would not describe myself as a pro painter, but I think that the standard is good at the very least - there are a number of pictures of the pieces I have painted in the game gallery for you to judge for yourself.
The game in full has only been played twice, but I have used the treasure cards and some characters a few times to play Ravenloft. The promo card is completely unused.
UK postage would be £7.99. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll happily ship worldwide but secure postage is likely to be significantly more expensive owing to item weight.</notes>

    <notes>Never played, just carefully punched and organized.  A nice sized baggie is provided for each character, plus a baggie for each set of cards.  If there was an insert I have tossed it.
If you check the picture (or ask me for a more detailed one), you will see two nice Plano cases that together make the game great for play and cleanup.  You can have them both for $8 extra, or I can just transfer the contents to baggies.  I will ask when I send you the invoice.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 120oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)
UPS Ground
