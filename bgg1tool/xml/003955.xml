   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff. The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (From back of box)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The card game BANG! recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Renegade - Be the last person standing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff.

Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;range_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;MISSED!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>
