   <description>By request of Fantasy Flight Games, Board Game Geek lists the various editions of Cosmic Encounter in separate entries. Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win. Shared victories are possible and a player need not occupy one's own system to win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>COSMIC ENCOUNTER 1991 Mayfair Games.  Includes all 48 Alien Power cards, 72 Challenge cards, 22 Edict cards, 48 Flare cards, 26 Destiny cards, 6 Planet Hex boards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 1 Warp board, 6 token sets (20 each color red, blue, yellow, purple, light blue, orange), 1 Hyper-Space Cone, 6 Planetary Power cards.  Complete with everything except the rulebook, so I am including printouts of : Mayfair Basic Rules, Mayfair Hex Rules, Eon Hex Rules, Internet Hex Rules, and the Eon _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Complete Book of Cosmic Encounter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Rules.  All components were hand checked for completeness and quality as follows... the tokens for light blue have 5 punched out, the rest of the tokens in all sets are unpunched.  It looks as if someone pulled the game out to play, started to setup and then put it all back away.  The rest of the game is in perfect condition except for 5 cards (1 destiny, 1 challenge, 3 flares) which have finger creases from being mishandled, unfortunately.  Considering the value of such a game, I have to be VERY picky about its condition.  If you wish to see pictures of the 5 cards please go to my website at this location -
http://www.drakezeus.com/cosmicencounter.htm
- Shipping weight is 5 pounds.</notes>

    <notes>Mayfair editions of Cosmic Encounter, More Cosmic Encounter and Simply Cosmic.  All fit in Cosmic Encounter box (no other boxes included).  Components have never been played with but are unwrapped.  This collection has home bases for 10 players.  It includes I believe the count is 110 aliens to choose from.  Box is in very good to excellent condition - it has some wear on the box edges but is quite functional.  Great collection of this favorite of the Mayfair edition sets.</notes>

Low rating is entirely due to damage to box - all pieces are present and in fine condition. This is the original EON Products version.
Shipment will be in mid-late June, when full collection of games is removed from storage.
Will accept Paypal - but buyer must pay all associated fees. Will ship worldwide. For shipments in US, game will be shipped priority mail. For worldwide shipments, amount charged will be actual cost.</notes>

    <notes>Eon edition, including expansions 1-3.
Box has some taped corners, and is worn.
Basic Set
 blue has 2 handmade tokens, 1 ok, 1 crappy.
 red has one handmade token
 1 colour is missing a token (forget which)
Expansion 1
 one purple token missing
 one purple system token has a small ripped area.
Expansion 2
 one gold token missing
 gold tokens are worn, look silver round the edges. 
Expansion 3
 ok
The powers have been folded (not something I would do), but powers and cards and boards are in good condition. Rules are present, but it makes more sense to download the full organized rules.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just interested in an expansion, make me an offer. Expansion colours can be swapped around.
Will get around to uploading images soon.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Eon version of the game and includes the first 8 expansions.  The game itself is obviously played and well loved, but is complete and not damaged (just game wear).  The game box has taken some damage (as all 8 expansions were stored in the box and frankly, they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit there well).  Some expansions appear to have been very lightly played if at all. Conditions range from acceptable (box issues as mentioned above) to like new (some of the expansions).    </notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill edition, now out of print and becoming difficult to find.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the process of cleaning out the game cabinet. Look back for more deals later. For open and played games, expect prices below what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay at an online discounter. 
Shipping: I will ship most games USPS Priority Mail using a flat rate box plus Shipping Confirmation - Actual Cost: $9.65. For some games, you may be able to obtain a cheaper rate if you contact me before purchasing. I will attempt to get you the cheapest and most timely shipping possible. 
NOTE: This is a larger and heavier game - shipping costs may be higher than usual.
Condition notes: Cosmic Encounter, Avalon Hill edition - New, still in shrink wrap. Excellent exterior condition.
All games come from a non-smoking, careful environment. I hope you enjoy owning and playing these games I much as I have.
I accept Paypal or Money Order or Cashiers Check. 
I do not accept personal checks because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship your game quickly with that payment method.
Currently only shipping to the U.S. If you are in a foreign country and really want one of these games, contact me and I will try to accommodate you - be aware that international shipping costs may be substantially higher.</notes>

    <notes>This is a clean, player’s copy of Eon Cosmic Encounter plus all expansions.  Due to the nature of the game (perforated cards, lucre chits, punch out moons, etc.) there are various ‘hanging chads’ but nothing that detracts from either playability or appearance UNLESS SPECIFICALLY NOTED.  Overall, I’d grade this as VG+ to Fine or “lightly but lovingly played’  The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in the main listing refers to the box damage and the odd missing rules sheet (full rules from Expansion 9 are included). Please GM if you have specific questions or concerns.

EDIT: What about the box?  It is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;waving alien_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cover:
[imageid=110749]
To be charitable, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s taken many shots to the body for the team. A couple of splits, a crease, some dishing and side scuffs. The front art is other than the dishing, pretty clean. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s included, but hey, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not buying this for the box are you :D

    <notes>This is the original 1977 Eon edition for 4 players. The game is in good condition. The game boards are slightly warped. The game is missing 5 of the  original Alien Power Cards, but I made a b/w copy of the full set on card stock and placed it in the game. So there is a full set in b/w and a partial original set in color. 
Please feel free to ask question(s) before buying the game.
Game is complete and playable and will be shipped from 98003
Game will be shipped cheapest way possible via US Postal with tracking added. (Unless you request faster shipping)
If you want insurance add $1.35 to shipping
Thanks

    <notes>This is the original EON version.
Rating is kind of a mixed bag. Box shows quite a bit of wear and has a split corner. Inside everything there in great condition. I doubt the game has ever been played. Two out of four colours are still unpunched.
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

The box (Eon, Second Edition) is very beat-up and held together with tape, but the components are in pretty decent shape.  You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll want to work out replacements for the Tokens and Star Discs (used in the Destiny Pile) because the following Tokens are missing - 2 blue, 12 red, 7 green, 20 yellow, 20 gold and 20 silver - as well as the following Star Discs - 1 blue, 1 red, 3 gold (including the one with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Reverse Cone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; sticker) and 2 silver (including the one with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Reverse Cone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; sticker).  In addition, there are two Lucre pieces missing (this will never affect game play) and two Cards (an Attack 5 and an Attack 7 - both have been replaced with handwritten cards using official blanks).
But everything else is there from ALL NINE LONG-OUT-OF-PRINT EXPANSIONS!  Powers, Flares, More Edicts, Moons, etc...

    <notes>Bought used, played once, put away.
Contents checked, all complete. Apart from the box wear, the contents are in very good condition. Very little wear considering how old the copy is.
Some wear on the box lid and base, some sellotape remains, otherwise no dents or splits. 
Can provide photos of my copy on request.
Can ship in the UK quickly, other places will need research (new at this).
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.</notes>

    <notes>Given its age, the box is only in acceptable shape. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been taped, and I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think of removing it for fear of damaging the box.  The cards and playing components are in good condition. This copy of the game includes 3 additional space hex boards in addition to the five boards that the game lists as components.  These 3 boards are on thinner cardboard stock but have the same look as the five thick boards.  This is truly a piece of board gaming history!  Own a piece of history, and order this one today!</notes>
