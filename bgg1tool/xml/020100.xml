   <description>Not a trivia buff? It doesn't matter! In Wits _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Wagers, each player writes a guess to a question such as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;In what year did the bikini swimsuit makes its first appearance?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;How many feet wide is an NFL football field?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; and places it face-up on the betting mat. Think you know the answer? Bet on your guess. Think you know who the experts are? Bet on their guess. The closest answer--without going over--pays out according to the odds on the betting mat. Strike it big and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll be cheering like you just hit the jackpot!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Wits _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Wagers is a trivia game that lets you bet on anyone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s answer.

Trivia for people who don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know stuff...
Not a trivia buff? It doesn’t matter! Each player writes a guess to a question such as “In what year did the bikini swimsuit makes its first appearance?” or “How many feet wide is an NFL football field?” and places it face-up on the betting mat. Think you know the answer? Bet on your guess. Think you know who the experts are? Bet on their guess. Strike it big and you’ll be cheering like you just hit the jackpot!

Shipping: Shipping rates will be determined upon sale or request. Insurance is optional but highly recommended for higher priced items. The shipping costs are NOT inflated. You pay exactly what I am charged for shipping, along with material costs. I ship through FedEx or USPS, whichever is cheaper. Normal shipping costs run from $8.00 - $11.00.
Payment: I accept PayPal, money orders, personal and cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks. Personal checks will be accepted but I will wait until the check has cleared before sending the item. I will add 3.9% to the price when paying by PayPal.
Return Policy: I want you to be completely satisfied with your item. Because of this, I will accept return of any item for a refund of the purchase price within 30 days of the sale. The item must be in the same condition that it was sent. I cannot refund the shipping cost.</notes>

Description: New, still sealed in shrink wrap.
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.

    <notes>The latest edition of my favourite trivia game boasts better quality components, but is still the same fun game. I like it because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not necessarily the know-it-all who wins: players bet on the different answers, which rewards canny play. It is great fun.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £22.50 (net of UK tax - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country).

  UK addresses: £2.75 (myHermes, takes 3 working days, tracked)
  Other EU countries: £13.14 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Europe outside the EU: £10.95 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Australasia: £17.70 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
