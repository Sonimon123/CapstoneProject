    <notes>NEW IN BOX -- all pieces still wrapped or unpunched as applicable. Only the shrink wrap has been opened. I bought it to play but just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time for all the games in my collection. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d feel better if this pristine game found a good home. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m fairly new on BGG, but you can check my 100% positive feedback on eBay (chaosjenkins) over more than 250 transactions. Email me at jenks [AT] henderson.net with any questions. Shipping is via USPS Priority Mail or UPS Ground. I always ship within 2 business days, and usually 1 day after receipt of payment.</notes>

    <notes>  I bought this as a Very Good game awhile back and had dreams of playing it, but as I suspected with my family, it never happened and most likely won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, so I will part with it.  It is punched and there are many little pieces in separate little baggies. I counted everything (except the 204 penny-size monster tokens), and everything is there, undamaged.  The traitors tome book is unopened, scenario book is opened.  I printed out the errata and FAQ and it is inside the box.
  Box not crushed or torn, but shows that it has been stacked and moved around.  Still makes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; sound when closed though.  NO smoke smell to it.
  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to continental US  for $10.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete. Components are bagged and in good shape. Some light wear on three of the six hexagonal character cards in the places where the counting clips slide back and forth (this is a common problem with this game). 
The box shows some light shelf wear, but is solid and otherwise in good shape. There is a a slight defect on one bottom corner of the lid which is sort of a slight bulge. (The defect is fairly unnoticeable). I would be happy to provide more details or a photo if you have any questions.

    <notes>Box is excellent with hardly any shelf wear.  I had the books bound at Staples, including clear covers, so the pages would lay flat.  I understand that they have been updated and are available for download from AH.  Many of the counters are still on the counter sheets.  The cards and tiles do not have any wear or marks on them.  A couple of the character tiles show wear from the adjustable plastic markers sliding up and down the stat tracks.  Figures are in excellent condition with no wear.  Photos available on request.  
Shipping will be at actual cost as shown on the online USPS Postage Calculator.  I do not up-charge for shipping and there are no handling fees.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure that the game will fit in a Flat Rate shipping box, which would cost $9.30.  If you wish it shipped in a larger box with more packaging peanuts protecting it, the postage will be higher.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Game has been played a few times, the counters have been punched but all are present.  The use of the little sliders have left some marks on the character cardboards, but no real abuse.  One of the plastic figures leans quite a bit, but it was bought this way.  I will also entertain a trade for Dragon Dice in bulk quantities for this game.</notes>

    <notes>This game is in very good condition, including the box insert, and all components have been separated and stored in baggies. All paper/cardboard components are straight and crisp. Everything is present except 2 of 30 clips (only 24 are needed for all 6 players), and 1 of 204 monster counters (there are many duplicates, so this will not affect game play). Box is in excellent shape with virtually no damage or shelfwear. Game is free from offensive odors (smoke, pet, mildew, etc).</notes>

    <notes>I took off the shrinkwrap to peak at the inside but never opened or punched out any counters.  In fact, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I even took out the rules to look at them.  It has been sitting on a shelf ever since.  I know I will never get this game played so thought to try and sell it.  Box is somewhat heavy and guessing will be between 3 and 4 lbs once packed up for shipping from 21702 zip code.  I only charge for exact shipping and ship once PayPal has cleared payment (usually 2 or 3 days).</notes>

However, box has two splits that were taped back, as show on pictures.  Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect the game in any way, and lower the price so it is good for you!
Will take Paypal payment, and Money Orders if from Canada.  If you are from around Montreal, you can come pick the game to save on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>In very good shape, box clean and nice, components bagged and in very nice shape also.  The game IS missing one modular room tile (the Pentagram) but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including a replacement piece and it really only comes up rarely in scenarios, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s minimal impact on gameplay, if any.
$10 shipping to the USA - Will ship to the UK but shipping costs will then depend on your location, I will inform you right away as to actual cost (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing somewhere around $20 extra).
For any shipping purposes, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be using US Post Office Parcel or Priority Mail and will only ship AFTER receiving a US Post Office Money Order that has been verified as genuine and good.
Thank you very much!

    <notes>This copy of Betrayal is new and unplayed, but has been opened and partially punched.  Basically, the rooms and chits have been punched out.  The cards, Traitor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Tome, and Secrets of Survival are all still sealed and unused.  Everything has been inventoried, and the game is 100% complete.  The box, is likewise pristine, with no dings, dents, or tears.
Bottom line, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a brand new game, just out of the celophane.

    <notes>This is an open but unplayed copy of the game.  I punched and assembled the character Hexagons, but everything else is as new.  The room tiles _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; counters are unpunched, the figures and dice are sealed.  The only blemish is the bottom corners of the box top are pushed in and creased.  Something was on top of it in the shipping box and it pushed them in.  
Buyer to pay shipping on 5lbs from zip 15670.  Thanks and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask any questions.  </notes>

    <notes>I only played this game a few times and left most of everything UNPUNCHED! Only character sheets and room tiles are punched. Everything else is sorted and bagged nicely.  I categorize its condition at _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but I am being VERY critical.  One instruction booklet has a couple creases (how it came), but the tomes are excellent condition. The box shows very little shelf wear with no crunched corners!  This is a great buy, complete, in like new condition and an excellent game! Please contact me for any questions you may have and let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s get this game to you and your gaming group! :)
-Regarding Shipping and Handling-
I am only charging for $10 for shipping and handling no matter where this needs to go within the U.S.  If S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is less... I will be happy to refund any excess; however, if the S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is more... it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s on me! :)  NO INTERNATIONAL or EXPRESS SHIPPING! Sorry for any inconvenience.</notes>

SHIPPING:
   USA: $12.75 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS loses or damages the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: If you can provide your email address, you may pay by credit card via Google Checkout.  Or you may pay by PayPal to karlhanf@comcast.net , or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>2nd Edition.  Includes the replacement tiles from Wizards of the Coast, which I included with the warped tiles (which I flattened - they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re probably not perfect, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re pretty good), just in case you want to do something with them.  So make two Houses if you want?!
Played a few times, but I used sleeves on the cards, which didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t cover them completely but kept them in their mint condition.
Shipping will be $15.00 within the continental U.S.</notes>

    <notes>The game is in like new condition and was only played three times. The game is complete and everything is in good condition. However some of the tiles are slightly warped. The game is the 2nd edition and this is the way the tiles were in the box when I originally bought the game.

 New spooky nights await you and your friends! The creak of footsteps on the stairs, the smell of something foul and dead, the feel of something crawling down your back - this and more can be found in the exciting refresh of the Avalon Hill favorite Betrayal at House on the Hill. This fun and suspenseful game is a new experience almost every time you play - you and your friends explore _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;that creepy old place on the hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; until enough mystic misadventures happen that one of the players turns on all of the others! Hours of fun for all your friends and family. Designed for 3-6 players aged 12 and up, this board game features multiple scenarios, a different lay-out with every game, and enough chills to freeze the heart of any horror fan.

Shipping at $12 will probably be about right.  If you wish to purchase multiple items I can get shipping combined with another one.

    <notes>Second Edition *with* replacement tiles (no warping!).  Never played, perfect condition except minor shelf wear on the box and edges of manual are just a little bent from the box being stored on its side.  Original insert is present, although I cut out the section under the player tiles to fit a nice Plano box with all of the tokens and such.  The insert works just the same as it always did.
If you want the plastic Plano box please add $4 to cover its replacement cost, otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll transfer the contents to baggie(s).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$3.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).</notes>

    <notes>Opened from shrink-wrap, cardboard components have been popped out, sorted, and bagged.
I have added electrical tape to the plastic stat sliders to make them tighter and keep them from sliding off the character stat cards, a problem you can see demonstrated on the Dice Tower review at 3:30 ( http://youtu.be/8GL-VvJjPT4?t=3m30s ). This is 100% removable and can be taken off before shipping if you prefer.
After opening the game and reading the rulebook, I realized this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the right game for my gaming group/family, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this to get a more straight-forward cooperative game.
Comes from a smoke-free home, shipping is flat-rate $13 in US.</notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC266330000)
New spooky nights await you and your friends! The creak of footsteps on the stairs, the smell of something foul and dead, the feel of something crawling down your back - this and more can be found in the exciting refresh of the Avalon Hill favorite Betrayal at House on the Hill. This fun and suspenseful game is a new experience almost every time you play - you and your friends explore _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;that creepy old place on the hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; until enough mystic misadventures happen that one of the players turns on all of the others! Hours of fun for all your friends and family. Designed for 3-6 players aged 12 and up, this board game features multiple scenarios, a different lay-out with every game, and enough chills to freeze the heart of any horror fan. </notes>

    <notes>Poor condition- the game was edited to removed some of the occult-like things.  So the pentagram chamber is re-faced to work, but not have original art.  The book of secret and other guides have some haunts crossed out in permanent marker.  The game is otherwise together. Avalon Hill edition.  The price is marked as such.  Playable, but certainly not in good shape. </notes>

    <notes>selling Betrayal at House on the Hill (2010 version)
Game is in good condition. Got this game from a trade in the past years. Everything is perfect except that the room tiles are a little bit waved (minor) maybe caused of humidity (not by me; will post pictures soon).
not playing from a year, so im selling it.
note:
theres also minor wear on the box corners.

However, a complete replacement set of tiles and tokens that I requested from Avalon Hill is also included so the quality of the game is very good. Has been played, but has been well taken care of and condition is very good. Shipping is 15.00 for USPS priority mail.</notes>

    <notes>The game has been played a few times, but the components are included and in good shape. Additionally, I have collected several small additional components which I will ship with the game. These include horrorclix figures, reaper bones miniatures, and other items found at various stores. These are items that match nearly every scenario in the game so that players are not just playing with the small cardboard tokens that come in the game, but with extra miniatures to make the scenarios come alive.</notes>

Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

    <notes>Second Edition. Only played once, has a little bit of shelf wear on the edges and I slightly modified the insert so I could fit a Plano underneath it. Components are pristine and complete. At one point I received the replacement tiles due to the original warping problems and these are fine.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>This is a copy I have had for a couple of years.  Due to warping issues that were widespread, I was sent a replacement set of everything cardboard in the game, which is pretty much everything except the 6 miniatures, dice, and cards (which are all still in very good/like new condition).  The replacement tiles are sealed in plastic, unpunched,  which pretty much makes this a new game.  Shipping is $10 to the continental U.S.</notes>

Hours of fun for all your friends and family. Designed for 3-6 players aged 12 and up, this board game features multiple scenarios, a different lay-out with every game, and enough chills to freeze the heart of any horror fan.</notes>

    <notes>Played several times.
Box has minor wear, otherwise intact. Game components in very good condition. Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say for sure which edition we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got, but since the tiles haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bent so far, we guessed it was the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; one. Several clips won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit on the character cards, though.

No clear signs of wear on any card or playing piece and the box is in excellent condition. Please do not hesitate to message me for further details and please check out my other items!
Shipping is to UK only and will be sent via MyHermes (5.95 for basic p_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;p, though I recommend adding recorded delivery and insurance for an extra 1.70)

    <notes>My late husband collected board games.  Didn’t always play all of them, but he loved to collect. Time to find new homes for the games.  He took excellent care of his games, and if they were played, no food or drinks were allowed near  the game playing area.</notes>

    <notes>I loved this game, been in my collection for more than a few years now. But, sadly, it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played in awhile now. So I am trying to find it a new home. All components are in great condition. The box is a little worn on the edges from being hauled over to game nights, which is the only reason I could not list it as Like New.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition. Includes the expansion Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Walk!
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/198452/betrayal-house-hill-widows-walk
The expansion can fit in the base game perfectly.
I do have the original expansion box if you would like to have it but it will likely increase the shipping fee.
A very fun and thematic game, perfect for Halloween and other occasions. 
I am selling it since my wife does not like it...
Buyer pays shipping or can pick up locally in Dallas, Texas area.
Thanks for looking o/</notes>

    <notes>Second Edition.
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>

    <notes>Entertainingly, I had left this on the shelf so long I thought the warped tiles was me storing it poorly or something.  I just discovered that the warped tiles were a production issue and I could have got the tiles replaced for free.  Not sure if you still can.  Only some of the tiles are warped, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played this a few times without issue.
Our group has extra copies of this game between us and mine never seems to make it to the table now so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather sell it.
