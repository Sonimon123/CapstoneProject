   <description>Antike II is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lead one of these nations to victory_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;but watch out for your enemies as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Antike II differs from the 2005 Antike in several ways, according to designer Mac Gerdts. To start, players now own city tokens, which allows them some degree of choice as to which resource a newly founded city shall produce. Military units have become more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are considerably easier. The scientific progresses were altered as well. Neutral temples now exist, which may be destroyed, gaining VPs of a general, without harming other players. The game features two new maps in a new graphical design, and a new card named _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;BELLONA_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (the ancient Roman goddess of war) has been introduced to counter the starting player's advantage._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gerdts notes that the main goal of all of these changes was to make the rules for a conquest of cities easier, while also opening more possibilities to win the game without the need to attack other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Antike II is an exciting strategy game where players represent ancient nations as they evolve and compete against each other. The players establish cities, erect temples, travel the seas, and study to search for new principles in science and technology. They sail the seas to settle new regions and then then defend them against attacks from the others. The game board is two-sided giving players two options when they play. Each player seeks to attract ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators to their nation. The winner is the player who first acquires the required number of these ancient personalities(based on the number of players). Antike II is different from the original Antike in several ways. In Antike II, players now own city tokens, which gives them a degree of choice as to which resource each new city can produce. Building a military capability is now more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are simpler. Scientific advancements are also changed. There are now neutral temples, which players may destroyed to gain victory points, without attacking other players.</notes>

    <notes>The game comes from a private collection (non-smoking and pet-free environment).
The box has been opened but the game has never been played. All cardboard components are unpunched, the cards are still in shrink.
The box lid is still in its original shrink wrap for extra protection. It can be easily removed in case you find it unnecessary. I’m simply very picky about game condition and like to give my games this extra protection :)
