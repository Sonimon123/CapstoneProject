   <description>In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent.  In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side.  Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone.  And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win.  Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tactics_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tactics_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards too._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Schotten-Totten FAQ._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

For more details on my USA and Canada special shipping offer please click robbirob and then the more info button.
For costumers in the USA and Canada the shipping of games can be arranged with United States Postal Services (games up to 1 lb. and only within the USA) or Fedex Ground (most of the USA and Canada). 
There is a small handling surcharge due to the higher effort of this special shipping offer. But believe me, the shipping costs and the delivery time (apx. 2 to 5 business days within the USA or 4 to 8 business days for shipments to Canada) probably will convince you.
If you need more details please e-mail me your ZIP or Postal code and I will reply as soon as possible with an irresistible (???) offer.

    <notes>Cards are all in great shape.  Box is flimsy and therefore shows some wear (including a small tear in one corner) but the goodies inside are all great.
Includes both English and German rules.  The English ones look like they were likely printed out from elsewhere.
