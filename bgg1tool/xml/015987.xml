   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.  Will they Prevail? _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA09)
The town of Arkham, Massachusetts, is in a panic. Horrific and bizarre events have begun to occur with increasing frequency—all seeming to point towards some cataclysmic event in the near future that may spell disaster for everyone. Only one small band of investigators can save Arkham from the Great Old Ones and destruction!
Arkham Horror was originally published by Chaosium, Inc., almost two decades ago. This new, updated edition features stunning new artwork and graphical design as well as revised and expanded rules from the game’s original creator, Richard Launius! No fan of the Cthulhu mythos will want to miss this opportunity to acquire this classic Call of Cthulhu boardgame!
Arkham Horror is a cooperative game for 1-8 players ages 12 and up, and can be played in 2-3 hours.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA09)
The town of Arkham, Massachusetts, is in a panic. Horrific and bizarre events have begun to occur with increasing frequency—all seeming to point towards some cataclysmic event in the near future that may spell disaster for everyone. Only one small band of investigators can save Arkham from the Great Old Ones and destruction!
Arkham Horror was originally published by Chaosium, Inc., almost two decades ago. This new, updated edition features stunning new artwork and graphical design as well as revised and expanded rules from the game’s original creator, Richard Launius! No fan of the Cthulhu mythos will want to miss this opportunity to acquire this classic Call of Cthulhu boardgame!
Arkham Horror is a cooperative game for 1-8 players ages 12 and up, and can be played in 2-3 hours.

    <notes>Box has some shelfwear, just at the corners. Otherwise in great, solid condition.
Only played a couple times. Great condition.
Includes the following expansions:
King in Yellow (no box, but still shrinkwrapped)
Curse of the Dark Pharoah (shrinkwrapped, box available*)
Black Goat of the Woods (shrinkwrapped, and still in box)
Dunwich Horror (box opened, unpunched)
*The entire package, MINUS the small Dark Pharoah box, will fit in a Large Flat Rate Priority Box (US only). This reduces shipping costs considerably. If you want the Dark Pharaoh box, there is a risk that shipping will rise dramatically. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to repack everything so it fits in the two large boxes, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t guarantee it. 
If you pay via paypal, I ask that you manage the payment to reduce or eliminate any fees I might have to pay. </notes>

    <notes>All the pieces of this game are like new.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened and unpunched all the pieces, but never played this game.  The rules have been taken out and read several times so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a little worn, and the box has some signs of wear, but for the most part the game is brand new.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA09)

    <notes>This listing is for the 2011 Arkham Nights event promo package.
All items are unused and in near mint condition. As crisp as they were when I received them saturday October 15th.
These promotional items were only ever offered at the 2011 Arkham Nights event at the Fantasy Flight Games event center on October 14th - 16th in Roseville MN. Attendance this year was even smaller than last year, so by my best estimate there are roughly 200ish of these promotional event packages floating around judging by perceived attendance at the event.
The promotional event package includes:
1 Hastur Ancient One card for the Arkham Horror game
1 Daoloth Ancient One card for the Elder Sign game
1 Dice/Monster Token bag with a Yellow Sign printed in gold metallic paint
1 2011 Arkham Nights art print
1 2011 Arkham Nights neck lanyard
1 2011 Arkham Nights event guidebook with:
    Interview with Kevin Wilson and Richard Launius, designers of the Arkham Horror and Elder Sign games.
    Guide to Arkham Horror expansions.
    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;To the Barricades_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; special Arkham Horror scenario. 
    2 Decklists for the Call of Cthulhu LCG. 
    Forbidden Alchemy expansion preview for Mansions of Madness game. 
    Excerpt from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Dance of the Damned_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; novel by Alan Bligh.
Event promo package will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail and will be packaged to ensure its arrival to you in the same condition as it has left my residence within 24 hours of the payment clearing Paypal or receiving postal money order.
Shipping within the US will be $7.00. Shipping worldwide will depend on location. I will ship domestically to the USA, or internationally to Australasia, Canada, or Europe. Please GM me for exact postal costs to your location. Insurance is optional, but STRONGLY recommended, especially for international orders.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA09)
 Arkham Horror was originally published by Chaosium, Inc., in 1987. This new, updated edition features stunning new artwork and graphical design (including a new gameboard, counters, cards, and playing pieces) as well as revised and expanded rules from the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original creator, Richard Launius.
 Players can select from 16 unique playable investigator characters, each with unique abilities, and will square off against the diabolical servants of 8 Ancient Ones, including Ithaqua, Hastur, and the terrible Cthulhu! No fan of the Cthulhu Mythos will want to miss the opportunity to acquire this classic Call of Cthulhu board game!</notes>

    <notes>The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.
Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.
Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror. Will they Prevail?
Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!</notes>

    <notes>Box and components are in very good condition with all pieces accounted for. Only minor quibble is that the bottom corner of the box was creased ever so lightly when one of my friends picked it up by one corner without realizing how heavy the game was. It is really very minor damage and all graphics on the back of the box are fine, but you can see a crease. Shipping is $12. 
Unlike other sellers, I list my shipping price upfront! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been surprised more than once when it comes to shipping so I understand the importance of stating it clearly.
I price my games lower than any other competitor because although I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to get rid of them, I need to start saving for my wedding. Help me out by taking more than one game and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you discounts! Also, feel free to make me an offer.
Combine shipping with any of my other items for savings!
Buy any 3 items and receive 5% off total purchase price.

Buy 9 or more items for 11% off total purchase price.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGVA09)
 
Arkham Horror was originally published by Chaosium, Inc., in 1987. This new, updated edition features stunning new artwork and graphical design (including a new gameboard, counters, cards, and playing pieces) as well as revised and expanded rules from the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original creator, Richard Launius. Players can select from 16 unique playable investigator characters, each with unique abilities, and will square off against the diabolical servants of 8 Ancient Ones, including Ithaqua, Hastur, and the terrible Cthulhu! No fan of the Cthulhu Mythos will want to miss the opportunity to acquire this classic Call of Cthulhu board game!

    <notes>This is for a BIG LOT of Arkham Horror games by FFG.
Every game/expansion is complete and in terrific shape.
The SOLE caveat being that  much of the expansion material is integrated with the base game components.  Some are still separate, but a lot if mixed in.
That said, everything is complete and in incredible condition!
This lot includes :
Arkham Horror (2005)
Arkham Horror: Dunwich Horror Expansion (2006)
 
Arkham Horror: Innsmouth Horror Expansion (2009)
  
Arkham Horror: Kingsport Horror Expansion (2008)
Arkham Horror: Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion (2006)
Arkham Horror: The King in Yellow Expansion (2007)
Arkham Horror: The Black Goat of the Woods Expansion (2008)
I will accommodate your requests as to which boxes you would like shipped as well.  The more, the bigger/heavier the shipping will be.
I will also try to ship as economically as possible.
Thank you, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask any questions!

All components are in pristine condition, original box insert is included.  Shipping to US only please.  This should easily fit in a flat rate box, so shipping for both should be under 20 bucks.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, base game played only twice and expansions never played (everything is cleanly punched with little to no wear). INCLUDES the essential DUNWICH HORROR and KING IN YELLOW EXPANSIONS. King in Yellow cards still in shrink.
The expansions are included in the original game box, there are no game boxes for the expansions. The insert for the game has been removed to accommodate the incredible amount of bits in the game. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including a sturdy plastic organizer box (think Plano) that houses all of the game bits and cardboard tokens. Very organized and will ship well.
ALL print materials included, including custom playaids for both the base game and expansions as well as eight custom printed character sheets.
Please contact me if you want any additional info or pictures.</notes>

    <notes>Played once and in excellent condition. Some very light scuffing to the box, but only cosmetic, and could be listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;as new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. All components have been carefully punched but are sorted and bagged up, and all of the in-box components are in as new condition.
Shipping to UK addresses would be £5.40 via MyHermes 3-day parcel delivery. Overseas delivery: just let me know your location and I will provide a quote.

Arkham Horror: The Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion (Revised Edition)
Condition: Original Owner. Everything is in combined into 3 boxes. Most expansion boxes have been discarded. Cards have been separated by expansion into bags that are labeled. Monster chits have been separated by expansion, color coded on their edge by colored highlighter (nothing on the flat sides, but on the thin, gray cardboard edges). This makes separating the monster chits very easy after a game. The 3 main boxes the game is in have some wear but are in decent shape. One box has a paper tear about 1 inch long and 1/2 an inch wide in the lower right corner. It is the oldest box of the 3, and has the most wear.
Shipping: 3 Heavy Boxes. Expect high shipping rates.</notes>

I just saw a listing of these for $700 online, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll undercut that.  Domestic shipping on these is FREE.  Shipping to Canada is $50.  Other international locations is $65.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGVA09)
Arkham Horror was originally published by Chaosium, Inc., in 1987. This new, updated edition features stunning new artwork and graphical design (including a new gameboard, counters, cards, and playing pieces) as well as revised and expanded rules from the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original creator, Richard Launius. Players can select from 16 unique playable investigator characters, each with unique abilities, and will square off against the diabolical servants of 8 Ancient Ones, including Ithaqua, Hastur, and the terrible Cthulhu! No fan of the Cthulhu Mythos will want to miss the opportunity to acquire this classic Call of Cthulhu board game! </notes>

    <notes>The lot includes the following base game and expansions:
Arkham Horror (original darker board, considered by some as a collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item) -- played a few times
Dunwich Horror - punched and played at most once
Miskatonic Horror - cards opened, tokens unpunched
Curse of the Dark Pharaoh (Revised Edition) - cards open, tokens unpunched
The King in Yellow - cards open, tokens unpunched
It also includes FFG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s first Arkham Horror novel, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ghouls of the Miskatonic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, and the free promo Ally card, Oliver Grayson!
This lot would cost you over $140 from an OLGS, my price is 35% less, and includes free shipping!
International: GM me before purchasing to be sure I can ship to your country and for a shipping quote (which will include a credit equivalent to US shipping).
All of my games are cared for in an OCD fashion in a smoke-free, pet free home!</notes>

    <notes>Arkham Horror plus The Dunwich Horror and Curse of the Dark Pharaoh expansions!
All comes in the original Arkham Horror box. No missing pieces and all game pieces are in very good condition. I probably played this game two or three times. With so many games in my collection this one just never got around to the table as much as I would have liked. I take pride in taking care of my games!
Sad to see it go but, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m hoping that someone else can get some play time out of it.</notes>

    <notes>This is a deluxe version of the base game, tricked out with extras. Extras include:
  *  Beautiful custom dice! 8/each blessed, cursed, and normal dice. Dice are beautifully jeweled color (red, blue, and green). Each die only has sides for successes (others are blank). Success sides show a large elder sign with a smaller number (so you can still look for 6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s).
  *  Component organizers! Plastic trays designed to make money/health/sanity/etc quick to setup and easy to grab.
  *  Crown Royal Monster Bag! This purple velvet bag is the hallmark of any discerning gamer.
  *  Amazing Tape for cards! Keep your cards together without damaging them by using this revolutionary tape that only sticks to itself.
Played a handful of times, and lovingly cared for. From a smoke-free household.  Buyer pays actual shipping via Fedex.</notes>

    <notes>Box corners have slight wear. Everything else is in great condition.
The game is heavy. I would prefer to ship using USPS Flat Rate boxes. But will search for the cheapest option.
If you are in Orlando, FL. Feel free to drive by to pick up the game. I would accept cash.</notes>

    <notes>I purchased Arkham Horror in 2012 and the game has been played one time. I enjoy the game, but for the folks I play with it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bit too heavy at two hours+. I would have listed the game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but the box has a few dings and scratches. All parts pieces, cards, rules, etc. are included. I also have a small tackle box to help organize the game that is also included.
If you have any questions about the game please let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to answer them.</notes>

    <notes>This price includes the Arkham Horror base game, Curse of the Pharoah expansion (revised edition), King in Yellow expansion and Lurker at the Threshold expansion.
Some of the character tokens, monster tokens and gate tokens have wear on them where they have been inserted into plastic stands. I have reduced the price to reflect this.
I have disposed of two of the expansion boxes and all content is stored neatly in base game and CotP expansion box.</notes>

Everything in mixed together and has been played only ONE time.  The main game box has a tear along one of the edges but still works great.  Everything else is in good or better condition and everything should be complete.  I am also throwing in a Plano box that is holding the counters and there are 10 of the black/green Arkham Horror dice.  This is a STEAL at $100.00!</notes>

Box actually says Arkham Horror Revised Printing 2006.
Minimal wear to box and skill markers.
I am also selling a like new version of the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh expansion (€ 10). Combine it with this game to avoid double shipping costs, and to get a discount of € 4 (so base game and expansion for € 26 excluding shipping costs).
Pick up possible in Nijmegen, to avoid shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for the base game plus all of the expansions in excellent condition.  All the boxes are included and EVERYTHING is sleeved (like 2000 sleeves) in nice Fantasy Flight sleeves (probably $130 worth in those alone).  The monster tokens are all in nice plastic coin cases as well.  Everything is also nicely sorted and bagged so you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a jumbled mess.  Domestic shipping on this is $50.  Shipping to Canada is $100.  Other international locations is $150.  I combine shipping on multiple wins at +$1 per item.</notes>

All components are all tightly packed in two standard AH boxes (I kept the original AH box, and the Kingsport Horror one). Cards are sorted by type, and kept together with rubber bands, small tokens fit neatly in a plastic compartment box, and all other components in plastic bags.</notes>

Arkham Horror: Miskatonic Horror Expansion
Arkham Horror: The King in Yellow Expansion
Arkham Horror: The Black Goat of the Woods Expansion
Arkham Horror: The Lurker at the Threshold Expansion
Arkham Horror: The Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion 
I bought these when they came out, so something like Dark Pharoah is the original edition. 
Big Expansions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; boxes are present. Small Expansions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; boxes are not present. 
Some or all inserts are missing - needed the space for all expansions. 
All non-small and non-miskatonic cards are sleeved. So, pretty much all location cards and mythos cards. Nasty undertaking (see my Runebound listing for more of the same). 
Boxes are in good shape. 
Also, for shits and giggles, included are tubes of red crystals and blue crystals I used to mark open gates and sealed gates. And present is a set of five green/black custom AH dice. The sixth side is represented by an elder sign. 
Pics are available on request. 
Shipping will be ugly. 
PayPal is a win for the good guys. 
Thanks, 
Mike</notes>

    <notes>This is a lot including Arkham Horror and all expansions.
All the components fit in 3 boxes (base game, Miskatonic Horror expansion, Innsmouth Horror expansion boxes).
The other boxes are available if you like (they are empty, and it will likely increase shipping cost).
Game includes custom made foamcore insert, and printed out dividers for cards.
It also includes a few plano boxes, and other little accents I used for my game.
Currently at Miniature Market discount prices, this lot would cost $314.
Shipping will be quite high. Please message for a shipping quote.</notes>

    <notes>My copy of Arkham Horror has been punched and played a couple of times. Please geek mail me if you would like photos or have questions about the game.
Buyer will pay shipping and packaging costs (not my time, but the box and bubble wrap). If you have a shipping preference, geek mail me and let me know.
Also, I live in the 21209 zip code (Baltimore, MD), so let me know if you would prefer to pickup the game and save us both time on shipping.</notes>
