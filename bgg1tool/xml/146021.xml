   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;reckoning effect_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGEH01)
Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldly mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction? Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One - an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas. With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game. </notes>

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £5.99 for this item.

Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One - an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas. With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game. </notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGEH01)
Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldly mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction? Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One - an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas. With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.</notes>

    <notes>Played only once. I am attempting to reduce my game collection size and this game just never made it to the table enough. It is a really fun game, however my game group just never got into it and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather see it get play time at another game group or household. I take pride in my game collection and take very good care of my games. This game, the rules, and box are in excellent condition. Please msg me with questions.

    <notes>One of the box edges was torn in shipping.  I glued it back together with a thick paper bracket.  It works okay, but you can still see where it was ripped.  There is also a crease running down the right hand side of the lid.  Other than that, the game has only been played three times and is in very good condition.  Comes with an extra set of dice.
Depending on where you live shipping costs $6-12.  Feel free to ask for the exact cost.  Games get mailed USPS Priority and typically go out the business day after payment is received.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for the base game and all released expansions as of 11/17/2016.  The condition is as follows for each component:
Base Game - Excellent, played twice by myself solo, box excellent too.
Expansions:
Mountains of Madness - see below
Under the Pyramids - see below
Signs of Carcosa - see below
Forsaken Lore - see below
Strange Remnants - see below
For all  5 expansions, the following applies:  New, only box shrink removed, components never removed from bags, tokens unpunched still in shrink, boxes excellent
Also, with all the expansions except Under the Pyramids, the component bags are labeled with initials to quickly identify which expansion the components belong to because at one time I combined all expansions except UtP into the base game box to save on shelf space and stored the expansion boxes not in use elsewhere.
Shipping will probably be about $15-20 depending on how far away from Texas you are.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Eldritch Horror has been played twice. All cards, tokens, dice, and game box are in factory condition. This game has been properly stored in a child-free, pet-free and smoke-free home. I no longer have the time to play unfortunately, so I decided to put the game up for sale. All components are accounted for and are as they were from the factory.
Shipping and handling will cost $12.00 (due to the large number of components included) and will be shipped out the following business day after confirmation of payment via payapl. Additionally, a tracking number will be provided once the package has been shipped.
If you have any additional questions feel free to send me a message via BGG. I also offer free pickup if the buyer is located in Rochester, NY.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for the Eldritch Horror core game, and the Eldritch Horror Forsaken Lore expansion.
This game has been played a few times, but all of the components are still in excellent condition. The forsaken lore expansion components are mixed in with the core game components. They are all in the core box. I do not own the forsaken lore box anymore. The core box has some shelf wear with some minor whitening on one corner. 
Buyer pays $13 shipping.</notes>

Both the base game and the expansion Mountains of Madness are included in the box. I no longer have the actual box for Mountains of Madness, but all of its parts fit in the base game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box. There is no insert, I just have the components bagged.
The game is in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played a handful of times, but there is no visible wear and tear on the pieces. 
Venmo is preferred, but PayPal works too.</notes>

    <notes>Includes Forsaken Lore and Mountains of Madness. Both expansions are in the original box and I do not have the expansions boxes anymore.
- Box has some wear on the corners. No rips or splits, but the image is worn 6.5/10. Look at images for details.
- All cards are separated into labeled bags by type or region. Card condition is great. All have been handled respectfully. 9/10
- Includes a plastic component holder for all of the chits. 
- Boards are in great condition with the only wear along the fold lines.
Its a great game, I just never get to play it anymore. If you have questions or would like more pictures please ask. 
I am local to Pasadena, CA, but am willing to ship. My estimate is shipping would be around $15</notes>
