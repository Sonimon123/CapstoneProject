   <description>This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pulses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;discretionary_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Counters: there is no counter manifest, so I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell if they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all there or not. However, it says that there were 520 counters, and I counted 520 counters (twice), so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess that there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all present and accounted for. </notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50

Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.

It is still holding together fine and is perfectly serviceable. The maps are in excellent condition. I noticed a very tiny stain on Map A, but other than that they are in wonderful shape. The counters are punched and sorted and the charts are also in excellent condition. The counter tray is missing, but I can probably find one if your heart is set on one. :)</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete, with counters clipped and neatly organized in the original counter box. The game is otherwise in pristine condition!
The rulebook and the two maps have no wear at all. 
The box has no shelf wear either and has been sitting in a closed cabinet in my home, under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. At this price and in these conditions, this game is REALLY a bargain.
I will ship worldwide at buyer’s expenses. Shipping to Europe is 13 Euros; within Italy 9 Euros, and 13 Euros to the rest of the world.
Paypal preferred. Feel free to email me with questions!
(IMPORTANT NOTICE: I am away from home on most weekdays, so allow a couple of days for a reply to your queries). 
Thanks for looking! Riccardo

    <notes>Would be unpunched but many counters have come loose. which is actually a good aspect since it indicates the counters are nicely die cut. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve noticed over the few dozen copies of this title I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold uneven counter quality. The loose counters are accounted for and ziplock bagged. rules booklet, maps and the pair of play aid charts are in unused like new condition. Decent box too. PLUS a very robust and comprehensive article collection for this title. About a dozen. Many of which don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear on the often incomplete articles indexes found online. And some cool aftermarket charts I acquired from someone who obviously had some love for the game. I print those out onto cardstock. The one to buy to play</notes>

    <notes>Unpunched version of the Victory Games classic
Box: Fair to good; one blown corner and a little shelf wear, but otherwise good
Rules: Very good to excellent; very minimal wear or thumbing
Map: Excellent; no issues at all
Counters: Unpunched; matte sprayed; generally well printed and punched; #1 is off left/right by 1mm, which affect 2 counters; #2 off left/right by 1mm, which impacts 4 counters; does suffer from typical 1980s countersheet issues with irregular sized counters in a few places
Other: Original 4 dice and counter tray
Weight: 1lb 7oz
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m prepared to listen to an offer, and would be more likely to consider if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying several game. Low-ball offers are likely to be ignored.
*** All games on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; list will be listed eventually - feel free to look through them and make offers ***
Shipping is done from 33947 via USPS Priority or Ground service, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to keep your costs down using Flat-rate and Regional-rate boxes if that works out cheapest. If you want a rough estimate of the shipping cost use the calculator at usps.com. Total the weight of all the games, then add a lb or two for the box plus packing materials. I ship to mainland US addresses only. (A couple of bad experiences.)
Payments via personal PayPal transfers are preferred (extra charged for cover any fees), but checks, money orders, cash, and other options considered. 
Not looking for any trades at this point, but may consider 18xx games.</notes>

PLUS Includes a multiple article (F_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;M, The Grenadier and others beyond the General/Victory Insider) supplement kit ...one of my favorite games to sell. I make a nice kit for it Of note I recently ran across a lengthy Paper Wars article which also includes their version of the leader variant (as presented elsewhere in the Victory Insider) so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive 2 leader variants with the raw materials quality printed onto cardstock for you to mount and cut. Many other optional rules and amendments to play in this Paper Wars piece. And it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t listed in the online article index</notes>

Box: Excellent
Laminated Maps A _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; B
The laminated maps are a great touch for longevity but will make shipping a little more expensive since they obviously no longer fold inside the box. I will find cheapest shipping method between 1 box and 1 tube or putting it all in one.</notes>

    <notes>All parts in very good condition.  Played (solo) once. After playing new edition of this game, I must admit to liking this edition better.  Leaders have more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;chrome_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, therefore more personal characteristics. And, random entry of leaders can be a very stimulating! experience.  Instead of generic naval capabilities, actual named ships are present here.  Etc., etc.</notes>
