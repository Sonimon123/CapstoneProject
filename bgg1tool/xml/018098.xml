   <description>(From the publisher)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Napoleon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From Back of Box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; map of the battlefield._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The game is in absolutely pristine condition, never played.  Out of shrink wrap, but all pieces etc. still in sealed bags.
This game uses the same system as Bonaparte at Marengo.  This is a very innovative and well produced game that makes Austerlitz a very playable and exciting game premise.  Destined to be a collector Classic.</notes>

The Battle of Austerlitz, 2 December 1805
 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;If the enemy dares to descend from the heights to take me in the flank, they will surely be beaten without hope of recovery._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
– the Emperor Napoleon,   
two days before the battle
On 2 December 1805, the Emperor Napoleon had lured the Allied Army under Czar Alexander into attacking him in one of the most famous traps in military history. The Allied army attacked but was split in two by a French counter-attack and disastrously defeated, giving Napoleon one of the greatest victories in the history of war - Austerlitz.
Napoleon’s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon’s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening. </notes>

– the Emperor Napoleon, 
two days before the battle
On 2 December 1805, the Emperor Napoleon had lured the Allied Army under Czar Alexander into attacking him in one of the most famous traps in military history. The Allied army attacked but was split in two by a French counter-attack and disastrously defeated, giving Napoleon one of the greatest victories in the history of war - Austerlitz.
Napoleon’s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon’s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening. </notes>

Napoleon’s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon’s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.</notes>

    <notes>This game is just out of shrink, and UNPUNCHED...though _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;unstuck_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is more appropriate as this is a block game with stickers for some blocks.  The maps are still in shrink.  If interested, email erwindj@aol.com.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t check this message box often.</notes>

    <notes>Simmons Games (SIS SG0002)
Napoleon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon’s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.</notes>

It uses two boards to make a double-size 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening. </notes>

    <notes>Closer to like new than very good but some of the leaders have been stickered.  There is still a full sheet of extra stickers in the box if you want to redo.  Other than that game is mint and never been played.  Some slight shelf wear but game was stored in a dry smoke free home.  Will ship game flat rate because it is HEAVY which is currently $11.30.</notes>

    <notes>Complete. Stickered. Game is in excellent condition (only played once) except for the map. That one time I played it, I bent it back to smooth it out during setup and it snapped. Now in 4 pieces instead of 2. No other blemishes and you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t detect the map binding discrepancy when it is all layed out for play. Let me know if you have any questions. Buyer pays shipping - I can get you an exact quote and can do FedEx Ground or USPS.</notes>

    <notes>Condition: Acceptable
Only reason for the rating is that there is a split corner on the box bottom - it was this way when I received and is most likely due to the weight of the boards. Everything is otherwise in excellent condition - I applied stickers to two of the metal pieces, everything else is unstickered.

    <notes>This game has only been played once, and all components are in perfect condition with the exception of the BACK of the game board which has some cracking on some of the folds due to trying to force the board to lay flat. One or two of these folds have tape on them, but note this is only on the back, and more of a flaw of the original board that refused to lay flat when first set out (it now lays flat and looks great). This game looks fantastic and very impressive with all of the pieces deployed. You will be very pleased!</notes>

There is an extra copy of German rules but it looks pretty much used. You will also get a printed colour copy of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Annotated Rules of Play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; v. 1.4 by Rick Mathews :)
The box, however, shows traces of storages: The corners are pushed in a bit and there the edges have white/grey streaks.

    <notes>All items are new and in shrink if so delivered by the producer.
All items are really on stock. No fake set-up here. No Order on demand.
International Customers, our precise shipping costs are as follows:
DHL International Shipping: Zone 1 (Mostly Europe): 15,00€+1,00€ per two kilos
Shipping costs can vary greatly after that and have to be asked for individually.
We ship only fully insured. So ordering only a small pocket game or anything very low priced may come out to be very uneconomical.
Methods of payment:
-You can always pick the game up at our storage location :-)
-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use paypal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)
Für unsere deutschsprachigen Kunden:
Sie können uns für alle Fragen gerne telefonisch kontaktieren:
Tel.: 0201-786877
Die Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschlands betragen 5,- Euro (inkl. 19% Mwst.). Ab 100€ versenden wir innerhalb Deutschlands Versandkostenfrei.
Alle Preise enthalten die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer in Höhe von 19%.
Bezahlmöglichkeiten für Kunden innerhalb Deutschlands:
- Alle Kreditkarten willkommen !
- Paypal
- Vorkasse
- Rechnung (Nicht für Erstbesteller, wir behalten uns vor die Zahlungsmöglichkeit per Rechnung von Fall zu Fall neu zu bewerten !)
 
Alternativ ist natürlich auch eine Abholung mit Bar-, EC-, oder Kreditkartenzahlung in unserem Lager möglich. (Im Geschäft wird neben Brettspielen auch eine üppige Auswahl an Rollenspielen angeboten.)

Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie können Ihre Vertragserklärung innerhalb von zwei Wochen ohne Angabe von Gründen in Textform (z. B. Brief oder E-Mail),
oder durch Rücksendung der Sache widerrufen. 
Die Frist beginnt frühestens mit Erhalt dieser Belehrung.
Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist genügt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs oder der Sache. 
Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:
Fantasy En_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Counter c/o Holger Willert
Gudulastr. 5 D(Hofgebäude rechts hinten) 
45131 Essen
email: fanen@fanen.com
Widerrufsfolgen
Im Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren. 
Können Sie uns die empfangene Leistung ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurückgewähren,
müssen Sie uns insoweit ggf. Wertersatz leisten. 
Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung - wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre - zurückzuführen ist. 
Im Übrigen können Sie die Wertersatzpflicht vermeiden, 
indem Sie die Sache nicht wie ein Eigentümer in Gebrauch nehmen und alles unterlassen, was deren Wert beeinträchtigt. 
Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, w
enn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt,
oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung,
oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. 
Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. 
Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. 
Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung erfüllen.

    <notes>The game was played only once and is complete and in excellent shape. Some stickers became detached from the blocks, but can easily be attached again. Anyways, the spare sticker sheet is also still there, so if necessary replacement of the stickers won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be a problem :)
I will ship anywhere in the world and never ask more then actual shipping costs. Shipping of multiple items can be combined.

Very minor stuff; barely noticeable. See pictures.

    <notes>The game condition is better than Very Good, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d consider it excellent showing no signs of box or component wear, except ... I broke one panel off one of the two map halves when I first purchased and unfolded one of the game map sections (the panel showing the legend and not terrain). This was famously noted on a NT forum thread the day to happened, and much laughter ensued. 
I have repaired this perfectly with black matte archival librarian tape on the back of the board and [i]this is completely unnoticeable when the map is laid out[/I]. I can provide images if requested. 
Stickers have been properly glued to the metal stands and do not come off. 
Non-smoking home.
Buyer pays postage via Canada Post parcel, therefore, will be expensive outside Canada (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess C$40 to the US?). Well packaged and tracked. Please note that the sale price is in $US, since most of my sales go there, and I will convert this price to Canadian dollars for the sale, to make adding postage easier. Can deliver to Origins in June 2018.</notes>

The only downsides are the box, which has a little wear and a split corner on the bottom, and one black wooden disc, which is missing.

    <notes>Never been played, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s closer to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, but labels have been applied.
Labels have been carefully applied (none are crooked).
Blocks were closely examined prior to applying any labels, to make sure there were no blemishes or marks on the top side of any blocks.
This game has not been played (regrettably so), and has been carefully stored in climate controlled, smoke free and pet free home.
As much as I hate to list this gem, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m at the point that with so many games in my collection, I decided to sell the ones that haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played in 5 + years (or never, as in this case).</notes>

    <notes>Like new, bagged. Contains a few print-outs of various supplements/aids. The stickers that are meant to attach to the metal leader pins don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stick very well. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re present, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably want to glue them on more permanently. Non-smoking household. Buyer pays shipping - warning, the box is deep, and will not fit in standard USPS Priority box.
Prefer Venmo but can also do Paypal.</notes>
