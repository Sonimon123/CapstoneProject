   <description>Zombicide is a collaborative game in which players take the role of a survivor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; each with unique abilities _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and harness both their skills and the power of teamwork against the hordes of unthinking undead! Zombies are predictable, stupid but deadly, controlled by simple rules and a deck of cards. Unfortunately for you, there are a LOT more zombies than you have bullets._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get; the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is zombicide!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Play ten scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, download new scenarios from the designer's website, or create your own!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     This is just a great game for zombie lovers!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for the KICKSTARTER ABOMINATION LEVEL with extra survivors and zombie versions, dice, zombies, signed lithograph, etc.  See Kickstarter page for details.  Note that some items will ship later.  Base game is here now, plus extra zombies, three additional survivors, special dice, and more.  This deal also includes an XL T-shirt.  Shipping is $30 for USA (that includes shipping now and later).  I will consider shipping elsewhere, but it would be $115 for the UK, for example.  I will ship what I already have right away, and will ship all other materials after they have all been received by me.  Add 4% for PayPal payment.
Think $160 plus $30 shipping is too much?  MAKE ME AN OFFER!</notes>

    <notes>this is the full Abomination pack with the 3 promo characters/stat cards, the extra dice and the extra Zombies, including the extra Abomination. NOTE: this has been opened and played twice but everything is like new. there is a blemish on one of the spawn tokens that was on it when i opened the game. some sort of printer error. 2nd NOTE: this Auction does NOT include the other promos and t-shirt that are coming in a second shipment in April. you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting everything that came in THIS shipment: the base game and all components, 2 extra sets of dice, extra Zombies and characters and an 8x11 print. 3rd NOTE: i stupidly tossed the cheap plastic holders that most of the regular zombies came in and have gathered them in a small bag. i still have the plastic for all the characters and the Abominations as well as the extra set of zombies, which also have their own box they came in. i also still have all 3 boxes and plastic for each of the 3 promo characters. 4th NOTE: you will pay for shipping, but i will ship it however fast/slow that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re willing to pay for. if you have any questions, mail me here at bgg.</notes>

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNGUG01)
Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts for 20 minutes (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own. </notes>

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £5.99 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £3.49. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
There is the option of first class post and faster courier may be available if required.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNGUG01)
Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts for 20 minutes (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own. </notes>

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNGUG01)
 
Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts for 20 minutes (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own. </notes>

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNGUG01)
 Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts for 20 minutes (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own.</notes>

    <notes>Complete Zombicide game only played a few times and in all original packaging, pristine condition. Base game miniatures are: 6 survivors, 40 walkers, 16 runners, 8 fatties, and 1 abomination. 
Also includes the zombie miniatures from the Kickstarter Abomination pack. This adds 20 more walkers, 6 more runners, 4 more fatties, and 1 more abomination. This does *not* include any of the promo survivors from the Abomination pack.
NOTE: I also have a fully painted version of exactly the same thing, if you are interested let me know and I can send pics.
Finally, you get a signed lithograph, an extra set of black special dice, and a set of glow-in-the dark dice. These dice are specifically made for Zombicide and are in addition to the standard dice that come with the base game.
I also have a Zombicide t-shirt in XXL if you are interested in adding it on for $15.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $15 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$3.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>COOL MINI OR NOT (CMNGUG01)
Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts for 20 minutes (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own. </notes>

In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own. </notes>

    <notes>Brand new in shrink.
I use Priority Mail regional rate and USPS Parcel Select to keep shipping costs as low as possible. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the Midwest shipping won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be too bad even though this is a pretty hefty game.
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I accept USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments, but your grand total will suffice to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after Paypal takes their fees out, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the transferred amount. So around $2 extra here. OR THERE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S THIS...
I also accept ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price plus exact postage.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, then choose the option of send money to friends and family, NOT to purchase goods. Make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees.)</notes>

    <notes>Some wear on the box, but all components are in like new condition. I removed the tray and sorted all components into ziploc bags. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s much easier to sort and organize.
Selling because we don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play it often enough and I need to cull down my collection. Hope it gets much more play from you!

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNGUG01)
Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, for 13 years old and up. A game lasts for 20 minutes (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survivors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hastily change to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going on, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Danger level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;survival horror_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own. </notes>

This is the Kickstarter edition of Zombicide and it comes with a *lot* of extra zombies and survivors. Additional Fatties, Runners, a whole lot of Walkers and an extra Abomination. Also 6 new survivors with their zombie counterpart selves: Nick Walker, Dave the Geek, El Cholo, Eagle, Cardboard Tube Samurai, and Troy. There are also some glow in the dark dice!
All contents are bagged and in excellent condition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played a few times and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only selling it because I decided I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not a fan of co-op games. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling Flash Point and its expansions if you want a bundle deal.
Base shipping cost inside UK for signed, insured delivery from Hermes looks to be about £6. With some packaging the final cost will be around £10. Will ship to Europe (and perhaps further) but shipping will need to be calculated.</notes>

I believe the extra zombies I have are from the Abomination Kickstarter level. There is an entire sleeve of 32 zombies walkers, fatties, runners as well as an additional Abomination with the Walk of the Dead card set (I believe since I can see card #43 - pack in shrink). I also have the set of black custom zombicide dice.</notes>

    <notes>This auction is for the Zombicide Season 1 base set..
It has been played a couple of times.   The back of the character sheets, which are blank character sheets, have been covered with plastic film so you can write on them with dry/wet erase markers....thus you can make your own characters.
This is a fun game, but not my theme of choice...I backed Black Plague and am way more excited for that.
So bid on this good deal and the game is yours.
Thanks for looking

This is my entire Zombicide collection. It includes my season 1 and season 2 (prison outbreak/ toxic city mall) kickstarter pledges + all stretch goals. There are also extra characters/minis we have acquired through promotional events and ones we bought via the kickstarter optional add-ons. 
Some of the miniatures have been painted.

    <notes>ZOMBICIDE MASSIVE SET
I bought this at the BGG.con 2015 Virtual Flea Market.   I have not played any of the modules or the game since I bought it.   It is in very good condition.
Here is the description that the seller listed in the Virtual Flea Market:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;This is a HUGE Zombicide bundle. It includes the base game, Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak, Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue, Zombicide: Toxic City Mall, and Zombicide: Angry Neighbors, along with many, many promo figures, extra tiles, an extra scenario book beyond the manuals, and other items. I am hesitant to call it a complete set of Zombicide Seasons 1-3, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gotta be close. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s stored in the boxes for the base game, Prison Outbreak, Rue Morgue, and Angry Neighbors. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not going to dig through this collection to find or sell individual figures because there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got to be close to 1,000 figures in there, dozens (probably hundreds) of character cards, and other materials. 
I would estimate the MSRP of this stuff as a whole as somewhere in the ballpark of $1,000._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Pictures available upon request.
I will ship this worldwide.   However, shipping to U.S. address will probably be around $25-$35 via UPS Ground.  
Seller pays for all shipping costs.  
Payment via PayPal</notes>

Prison Outbreak and Toxic City Mall are punched but unplayed. Base game cards have been sleeved, played 5 times. Some expansion cards aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even open. Walk of the Dead was incorporated into the base game.
I have compiled everything into the two large boxes (Zombicide and PO). I will need to ship both boxes and they are large and heavy, so expect shipping to be pretty high ($20+).
*NO KS ITEMS are included, except extra regular zombies*

    <notes>Includes the core Zombicide game and Toxic Mall expansion all stored in the core set box.
Played once; some wear and tear on the cards from shuffling, and box also has wear and tear on the corners. All components are included - I gave them a quick look over to double check, and everything seems to be in good condition. I noticed one of the miniatures has a warped base, and another miniature has a warped weapon. Otherwise everything should be fine. The miniatures are stored in a bag, not the original plastic molding. 
Will only ship to the UK, so UK buyers only please. Shipping handled via ParcelForce (Approx. £10.95)</notes>

    <notes>KS season 1, 2, 3. The first season has been open but everything else is sealed. There is little damage to the s1 box but everything else is for season is very good condition.
I am not accepted  any offer unless it’s more than what 
I already am asking for, nor will I sell anything out of this bundle. It all goes or doesn’t go at all.
Finally the shipping will be expensive for this. Not sure why every thinks this will be anything but that. It’s big, it’s heavy. There is no getting around it, period.
Look at the bright side. I paid 3 times as much for this stuff and most of which your receiving in the the same new condition I did.</notes>
