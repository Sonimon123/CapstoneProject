   <description>San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;violet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 238)
Puerto Rico_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s golden age returns. Through you! Players travel now to the capital city of this beautiful island. Who will build the most important buildings? Players build palaces, poor houses, silver smelters, gold mines, and many others - each with its own special features. The cleverest player will build well and win! As with the board game, players choose roles which can help all players, but the choosing player gets a special privilege with the role chosen. Players build buildings, produce and sell goods, and so on. The game is based on Puerto Rico, but different enough to give players new challenges and opportunities for fun and enjoyment.</notes>

    <notes>Played about 20 times, but in very good condition.  This ALSO includes the 2 expansions form the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Alea Treasure Chest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; neither of which have been played. I usually shuffle by dealing out cards on the table, not riffling or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;standard shuffle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; if you get my meaning.
The cards have little to no wear on the edges, and there are no marked cards (from folds, creases, etc.).  A custom tuckbox to hold the role/market pieces is included. Also 2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;card summary_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; sheets.
I generally don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like box inserts (unless they are REALLY good) so I ditched this one - but have everything in itemized zip-top baggies or similar.</notes>

    <notes>The game has only been played a couple of times and overall is in like new condition.  However, when punching one of the trader tiles a small piece of the printing on the back of one of the trader tiles was torn off.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess it to be less than a centimeter long.  That is the only issue.  All cards are accounted for!

I usually ship within 1 business day. I have a postage account so usually can get discounted shipping, which I pass on directly - so postage will be actual based on destination.
(Sorry the price is higher on this one.  After fees and my shipping cost I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m basically selling it at what I paid.  This is not my copy, which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m keeping because we really like this game.)

    <notes>One of my favorite medium light card games... much prefer this to Race for the Galaxy.
At some point I lost one of the 5 trading house tiles... so I made up 5 glossy blank on one side game cards and wrote the same info (actually more info, spelling out the goods types for anyone color blind) and shuffle these up instead.  Ironically I find these work better than the tiles did as the tiles are narrow and easy to knock over while the cards don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t and are easier to shuffle as well).  See the attached picture for what they look like.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to also include a set of 5 blank game cards so you can make an even nicer set if you want (vs. my bad hand writing).
UPDATE: I found the plastic insert so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to you if you want it in the box or not... I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if this game w/a box insert or not... if it did I tossed it and instead prefer to bag the components, including cards, so they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get tossed around when traveling. 
Looks like this (my) copy was played 48 times based on the number of scoring tables filled out!
34 score sheets left on the pad of score sheets... note that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s good for another 136 games since each side has 2 scoring tables and are also double sided.</notes>

    <notes>English edition.
The contents are in such good shape that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d say that this was played once at most.
The box has a very, very small amount of wear, a teeny-tiny ding in one corner and a couple of sides of the lid bow a little, so they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t quite snug anymore.

Exception: if you buy more than $75 worth of games from me at once, I will ship them. Please ask for a quote as that many games will likely be large/heavy.

    <notes>San Juan, Rio Grande Games/Alea English first edition 2004.  Complete and in very good overall condition.  Box has some minor wear at the edges and corners, but nothing significant.  There is a small tear in the paper on the right edge of the box (smaller than a dime).  Cards have been played but are all in great shape.  Role tiles have a little wear from sliding on a table, but are still good.  The score pad only has a few missing sheets.  Overall, a very nice copy with lots of life still in it.  Plan for an additional $10 for US shipping - might be cheaper if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re near AZ (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll likely use a USPS Regional Flat Rate A box).  Shipping from 85704.</notes>

    <notes>Very Good to Like New Condition!!
Truly a Great game!
Cards are in great condition as they were sleeved.
Cards come sleeved! - FREE
Played a few times.
Score Pad intact and pretty much unused.
Box is in really good condition too.
Game Tray has been cut and slit to fit sleeved cards and allow the box lid to be closed. Otherwise intact and fits all the components nicely.  You can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell the tray has been slit or cut when you open the box at all as the cards sit on top of the card holder area (where the slit is).
Cash - Local Downtown TTC Pick up - Toronto, Canada.

The components are not punched and the cards are still shrinkwrapped.  I do not remember why the outer shrinkwrap was removed - sometimes I removed it when it was ripped and sometimes I would remove it just to check that all of the components were included.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game is still in shrinkwrap.  However, one can tell there is a just a bit of box damage.  In the lower left corner of the box top, there is a slight convexity.  As if something heavier was on top at the spot.  Maybe 1/32 of inch convex.  The rest of the box is just fine.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>New in Shrink, 1st Edition, 2004, Rio Grande Games
San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;violet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.
In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.
Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.</notes>

Note: If this game had an insert then I no longer have it (most likely removed to accommodate the sleeved cards). Otherwise it is all present and correct.</notes>
