   <description>Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents. These all get placed on players' film-strips, to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors, but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors, even worst film._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts as money, and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;See Movie Comparison - Traumfabrik for listings of movies and actors in each version._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This copy of Fabrik der Traume has been punched and played once. All the pieces are included, as is an english translation of the rules. (Note: this is not the edition that came with the CD, so the CD is NOT included.) It is in pristine condition, and if I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t keep getting in trouble for playing games, I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t be selling it. Add $5 for shipping to the continental US (for a total of $30).

    <notes>Traumfabrik edition.  This game has been played once and the components are in excellent condition.  There is a ding in one of the box corners.  The box is still sturdy and not torn. No music CD.  Minor dishing on bottom.
I ship to the United States only. I prefer paypal payments but I accept money orders as well. I will ship once I receive payment.
I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion. While I take every measure to make sure the game is packed carefully and well, I cannot be responsible for damages caused during shipping. Insurance is available to the buyer at cost.
Shipping is $12.00</notes>

    <notes>Traumfabrik or Fabrik der Traum (with real actors from Hollywood_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Golden Age)
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>This is the meanwhile pretty rare limited German _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Traumfabrik_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; edition containing also the CD.
Game is still in shrink. Shrinkwrap is torn a bit and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a slight scratch on the top. Also one corner is a bit dented. (Guess this description sounds worse than it actually is... :)
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Fabrik der Traum - Hasbro (German 2nd Edition), 2001
This is Fabrik der Traume, the second German edition; opened but unpunched.  The box has slight damage to one corner and the impact seems to have cracked the plastic insert as well; however, the components are unaffected and in great shape.
Shipping is available to USA and Canada at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense from zip code 97355.</notes>

    <notes>Traumfabrik German Hasbro edition.  This does not contain the music CD.  Opened but never played, entirely unpunched in excellent condition. Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $8.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

The components of the game are like new, but one corner of the box has a scrunch, and the inside plastic tray has a small (hidden) crack in one part. </notes>

English edition. Played once. Components inside are in excellent condition. Box is in good condition, but it shows a little wear. I had a box band around it, so that left a mark. You can have the box band...
Also in this listing is Lost Valley, the newest Kickstarter edition. Unpunched and everything looks great. Also comes with the Yukon mini-expansion in a baggie, with new expansion tiles and reprints of misprinted tiles.

    <notes>Version - Uberplay
Condition - New in shrink-wrap.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>The good one with real movie art and Marilyn Monroe on the cover.  Yes, that does mean it is in German, but translations are easily available.
Still in shrinkwrap.  Wrap and box have shelfwear from the years.  Box has a crease along the top of the front.  The picture probably makes it look a little worse than it does in person.  The light was all from the top close to flat with the box front.</notes>

    <notes>Bought new, played once, put away. Box and contents in perfect condition, as new. Includes a music CD of classic American songbook.
My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (give me your EMAIL please).
Can ship quickly in the UK cheaply by courier.
Can ship quickish to the EU by Royal Mail
Can ship slowly by sea to the USA/Canada by Royal Mail cheaply. If you want airmail, that costs.
Other locations will research when I get an order.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
If you make the Paypal payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If you make the Paypal payment as a commercial transaction, I get charged near 4% of the payment because you get protection in a dispute. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously.</notes>
