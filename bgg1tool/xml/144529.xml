The fifth faction? It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a mystery. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s precisely why you made the trek to Theseus, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s precisely why you will die... In Theseus: The Dark Orbit, players move their pawns around the space station and activate the abilities of different rooms. Every move you take changes the movement possibilities of your opponent. On your turn, you need to think about which room you want to reach and (in addition) how to mess your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s movement, which leads to great choices and meaningful decisions. Rooms abilities change during the game as players install trait cards that give rooms new abilities and skills. Players create Theseus during gameplay by placing traps, smart guns, secret passages and many other features. In every game Theseus looks different; in every game it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s deadly for you in a new way... Rules for team play allow players to engage in incredibly emotional 2-vs-2 battles. With perfectly balanced factions, players will be able to fight engaging and deadly battles as a teams. Each faction has a unique deck of cards, and before the game starts, you discard ten cards from the deck. In basic mode you discard at random, while in tournament (master) mode you choose cards and build your deck. With five factions and 110 cards, the game can provide years of unique experiences. </notes>
