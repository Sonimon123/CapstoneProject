   <description>In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>NOTE: Most of the other marketplace offerings here do not include Pigsy, Bob, and Elysia. This pack includes all things that were KS exclusives.
Includes core game, Guildmaster pledge box with all contents, Pigsy, Bob, and Elysia. All items are new and sealed in the original packaging. This covers everything that was exclusive in the Kickstarter campaign.
Refer to the Kickstarter page for details on the Guildmaster pledge and other items: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/arcadia-quest
Items:
- Arcadia Quest Core Game, approx. $80
- KS exclusive Nameless Campaign, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing $30-$40 if it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t KS exclusive
- 26 extra KS exclusive heroes, approx. $10 each if they were sold separately
- 24 sculpted death tokens
- 20 sculpted wound tokens, not sure on value as 60 of these cost $10 for backers
- 30 sculpted coins, 100 of these cost $10 for backers
- 1 set of special guild dice, $10
- KS exclusive Guildmaster box, has no real value but it can hold all the extra stuff that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the core box
- KS exclusive Bob hero mini, $10
- KS exclusive Pigsy hero mini, $10
- KS exclusive Elysia hero mini, $10
The extra KS exclusive heroes went from 22 to 26 in a KS campaign update where the 4 faceless minis were being included as heroes with hero cards.
I have this stuff in hand and ready to go. Shipping will be approximately $15 within the continental U.S. via USPS.</notes>

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNAQ001)
In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces. Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign. Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.</notes>

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNAQ001)
In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces. Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign. Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.</notes>

    <notes>Arcadia Quest + extras. This was the kickstarter version, so as a backer I also got the Guildmaster box with a bunch of extra heroes and a small campaign to go with it. I think I also bought $10 of extra little plastic bits. These extras are also included in this sale.  The game was opened and the components verified complete, but it is new otherwise. Shipping in the US only via USPS. Contact me for shipping, default is a large flat rate box for $15.00 but if another way is cheaper I will let you know.</notes>

The game box came with a split that I mended with a thick paper bracket.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fairly sturdy.  The game was played once and everything is in very good shape.  
Depending on where you live shipping costs $15-$22 for Fedex Ground.  Feel free to ask for a shipping estimate.  Games typically get mailed out the business day after payment is received.</notes>

    <notes>This game is fun, but I was hoping for a co-op experience and it is VERY competitive.  The game is opened, played twice, all cards and components separated neatly into baggies, and handled with care.  Only selling for cheap because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m looking to recycle the funds back into my board game budget ;)  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m hoping someone will give this game a good home!
Buyer pays shipping, which depending on location will be about $12-20, depending on distance from California.</notes>

    <notes>In excellent condition. Opened and organized but never played. I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I will get around to it and I got it for a decent price on Amazon during a sale so I would like to just pass it along to someone who will give it good loving home for the price I paid. Buyer pays shipping. Probably around $15 give or take. Shipping from 97215. I will be out of town the weekend of September 1st - September 4th so if this sells during that time I will get it in the mail as soon as I get home and payment has been sent.
Open to trades and questions!</notes>

    <notes>This is for the original Kickstarter edition of Arcadia Quest.  It includes the Guidlmaster Kickstarter Heroes, The Nameless Campaign, and all other stretch goals/exclusives that were not add-ons.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played 4 times.  The insert has been removed and the figures consolidated into a plano box that is included.  Why is this listed in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition?  Because I began to paint six (6) of the figures.  They remain partially painted.  I can do one of two things for the purchaser -- leave them partially painted OR I can re-prime them (white or black, your choice) so that they are just plain. Let me know what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to do.  
Buyer to pay shipping from 94590.  Please note that given the size of this, shipping is likely to exceed $30.  It may be possible for me to fit it into two flate rate medium boxes.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like things sent separately in this way, please let me know.  
Happy to answer all questions!</notes>
