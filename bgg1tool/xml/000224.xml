   <description>History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Online Play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;a target='_blank' href=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;http://gamesbyemail.com_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rel=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nofollow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;http://gamesbyemail.com_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;/a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; (English, turn-based)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     ===========_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contents of 1993 AH edition:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 page rules folder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 page sample game folder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mounted mapboard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 x 96 army markers (25 I/V, 4 I/IV, 20 II/VI, 30 III/VII, 5 IV/VII,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 IV/VI, 6 IV/V)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 x 6 Monuments_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 x 7 Fleets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 x 1 VP marker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;20 Forts/Fortresses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;28 Capital/City markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;4 Sumerian Armies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;five six sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;64 Event cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;48 Empire cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill edition with the cardboard counters. I have not counted the counters, but they seem to be all there. Given that they are non-specific, even if one or two are missing, it wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be a big deal. Missing one die and the other dice are not originals. Cards and other components are all present (I counted the cards) and in very good condition. Box is compressed and has a small hole in the bottom of the front cover on the edge. Inside components are all in good condition, however.</notes>

    <notes>Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition.  Complete.  An extra part for each unit was included originally; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m missing a few of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;extras_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but I do have the amounts listed in the rule book for each unit.  Pieces are bagged separately by epoch and color.  Card decks are in paper card holders; when I got the game, some of them were bound with rubber bands, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear to have hurt them.</notes>

    <notes>The newer AH/Hasbro version with the plastic miniatures.  Box condition is very good, sturdy with one lid corner showing visible scuffing.  The contents are in like new condition, probably only played once or twice (never by me since owning it).  All items are accounted for (107 figures per color, I did count every single one of them).
This is a big box game so the shipping will probably be ~$12-$15, with delivery confirmation.  Insurance is extra; foreign destination will cost more.
*Note #1: Last copy I have left, so I increased the price slightly as my interest to sell is lower.
*Note #2: There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a service fee if you use Paypal with credit card.</notes>

Pieces intact and in good condition. No _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;damage_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to speak of....just normal wear for a game played about 8-10 times.

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill / Hasbro edition, with plastic pieces.
CONDITION: Overall in excellent - unused - condition! 
The game has been opened but never actually played - 5 of the 6 sets of figures are still sealed in their original bags, as are the monument, fort and city tokens. The event cards are pristine in ziploc bags as are the score counters and fleet markers.  The only blemish is that the lid of the box has a 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; split at the junction of the top and one side, with minor corresponding damage to the base,  but is otherwise sound.  
POSTAGE COST:
This game weighs 2.6 Kg packed - it is HEAVY!
UK postage:  £8.00
European Postage: £31.50
Rest of World Airmail: £51.00
Rest of World Surface: £42.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment.

UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail to Rest of World can take over a month!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.

Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.

    <notes>Hasbro/AH version (the one with all the cool plastic miniatures pieces).
Shrinkwrap removed just to inspect contents. Otherwise it is in new unpunched (mini still in bags) condition.
Since shrinkwrap is removed, the outer box will have very very minor wear. But the box looks new to me.
From a smoke free home. Contents smell great too :)
Buyer pays actual shipping, plus a couple of nickles and dimes to cover gas (I rounded up to the nearest dollar).
Contact me by email or geek mail if you have any questions.
NOTE: This is quite a big box and quite heavy, international shipping will/can be expensive...</notes>

    <notes>Large Avalon Hill version. It has the different colored minis rather than the cardboard chits.
Also a great game but the person I normally played with moved to COlorado and can not get others to play since.  I have tried its been 4 years of trying.  I now have to let it go due to a 2 year old boy wanting more of my time and well money. :O)
Shipping is expensive. I like to use Priority Mail shipping since it is to the destination faster but let me know if you want a cheaper method and I can get you a quote.
If it does not sell here you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see it at Gencon auction.
International buyers ask for shipping quote.</notes>

    <notes>I have both the Gibson and Avalon Hill (Hasbro - with figures) editions. So take your pick (although I will only be selling one or the other):-
Gibson £35
Avalon Hill £60
If you want the Gibson one gm me and I will adjust the price for you to click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. Both editions are heavy, particularly the AH one, so although I will sell internationally the shipping costs would be high.</notes>

    <notes>I purchased this game used, played it, didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like it.  Players copy, not for mint-condition collectors.  Some very minor shelfwear.  All components organized and present.  Priced to sell - not in publication any more.
This is the Avalon Hill/Hasbro Edition with the plastic bits.  The game is a used copy, but in good shape notwithstanding.  I purchased it used several years ago, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it once.  The box has shelf-wear (from the previous owner) from sliding back and forth on a bookshelf.  The rules are a photocopy, not the original, but all the pieces are present and accounted for and the board is in excellent shape.  
Due to odd size, shipping to the U.S. via Priority Mail will likely be about $15.00, give or take.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill version from the early 1990s.
Box top has a significant outward bow and is slightly concave. Box top shows wear and light dirt. Box bottom shows light wear and dirt around the edges. All the interior components -- The rulebook, sample game book, card decks (still in their wrappers), counters (unpunched), mapboard, and dice -- are near mint.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you.  I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>2001 Avalon Hill edition with hundreds of plastic bits!
All plastic bits are complete, with two of the colors still sealed in their original bags.  Cards are complete, and are crisp and look unplayed.  Board and rules are in great shape.  Box shows no bowing, but has some whitening at the corners.  All cardboard bits are in great shape, with 2 pre-eminence markers missing (one #4 and one #5).  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to track down these parts, and will send them along if I find them.  In the meantime, they are easily replaced and will not impair game play.
Shipping is $18.00 within the US.</notes>

    <notes>2001 Avalon Hill Edition with great plastic components.  Very little shelf wear, only played once, great condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 100oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>1993 Avalon Hill edition.  All counters and cards counted and verified.  One of the four _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sumeria_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters is a little off white than the others (see photo).  Cards in excellent condition with no creases.  Board in excellent condition.  Box has minor wear but no split edges or tears (see photo).  Overall a great copy for play.  The box is a little heavy so shipping from zip code 21702 may be a little more than other games.  If in doubt please ask for a shipping quote before ordering.  Please see photos and if you need any more information, please do not hesitate to ask.</notes>

    <notes>History of the World
Avalon Hill
2001
Components are in excellent condition.  Includes the Gameboard; 5 Dice; 30 Capitals/Cities; 32 Forts; sealed bag of Monuments (rules indicate 36); hundreds of plastic pieces - other than there only being four (out of five) dark blue Egyptians, there are at least as many pieces of each type and color as the rules indicate; 12 Coins/Fleets; 42 Score Charts; 8 Pre-eminence Markers; 49 Empire Cards; 71 Events Cards; cardboard box insert; rule book; 2001 Avalon Hill catalog insert.  Other than the one missing Egyptian figure, the game is complete.  I suspect that the missing piece was not included in the game in the first place.  
Box is in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pretty good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.  A large paper tear on one corner has been repaired with transparent tape, and there is moderate creasing on the lid where something heavy was set on top of the box.  In general, it looks good.  No split corners.

    <notes>On hold for John Rivera.
This is the sought after Avalon Hill/Hasbro edition with the plastic minis. All of the components in this game are in excellent _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition and the game has never been played. Cards are pristine. The box itself has a few dings on the outside box, and a couple of corners on the inside box that are starting to split due to poor packaging when I purchased the game. I can repair the split corners using a bit of wood glue (works like a charm!) or just leave it to you to fix it if you like later.

There is wear on the box that has been neatly repaired where possible, and some dishing from 21 years of storage.  Excellent player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of the game - checked for completeness and ready to play.  There is some light staining in the rules leaflets but no writing or hilighting.

    <notes>This is a used copy that was played a couple of times.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been sitting on a shelf for years and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about time this copy saw some action on someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s table--maybe yours!  I confess that I did not count to verify that all 700 and some plastic miniatures are still in the box, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never been careless about such things so odds are everything that it came with is still in the box.  The shipping price will be the exact cost to ship from Toledo, OH to your location.  I am a careful packer and I only use brand new sturdy cardboard boxes.</notes>

    <notes>This is a new boxed copy of the Avalon Hill/Hasbro version of History of the World.  The game is in mint condition - still in its original shrink wrap.  I used to own an online business selling games (primarily MTG cards).  This one was never sold.  It was tucked away and (frankly) forgotten about.
This out-of-print classic is now rare to find.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game is no longer in shrinkwrap.  But the game is unplayed.
All of the game components are still in their original bags.  The following items have been inventoried and are fully present: (rules, gameboard, dice, capital/cities, forts, monuments, coins/fleets, pre-eminence markers, score charts, empire cards, greater event cards and lesser event cards).  They are still in their original bags.
I have not inventoried the epoch plastic pieces in each of the six colors.  Five of the original six bags are still unopened and I wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t going to change that now.  The sixth bag (containing the green pieces) was opened.
The gamebox storage container (via the cardboard walls) has been put into the slots of the gamebox.
The outside game box is in excellent shape (amazing after all of these years).  At the top left of the gamebox top is a small piece of tape holding down the box cover paper.  Looks like there was a small split in the paper at the box corner cover.  The game box cardboard looks just fine.
Game comes from a non-smoking home.</notes>

A Brief History of the World
History of the World
History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear. The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history. Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s clever mechanisms can help balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.
Gameplay: Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch. The game board is a stylized version of the globe. The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events. Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation. Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events. There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few). Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires. One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t gotten one yet. If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch. Then the next player draws and makes his decision. The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws. Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by). One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Empire is called.
Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand. The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s actions. If the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them). A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop). If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s starting land with one unit of the Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s available troops.
Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer. To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it. Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from. In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well. If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense. Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker. In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.
At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort. On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land. Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues. Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered). After the active player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Empire is finished with it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.
Then scoring takes place. Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch. One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land). Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area). These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example). Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s color from all Empires controlled that remain on board. Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.
After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him. These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then. This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).
Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores. The player with the highest score wins.
