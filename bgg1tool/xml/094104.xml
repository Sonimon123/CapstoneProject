   <description>You could be the greatest warlord the isles have ever seen. Your thirst for power is matched only by your strategic wit and cunning. You know no rival, aside from your brother._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As sons of Zeus, you stand poised to conquer all of Greece, but not without the blessing of the gods. To determine who shall rule the domain of man, the gods have devised a contest and lent their most powerful forces for the cause: pillage and raze three cities. When the carnage ends, only one brother will be victorious, while the other will fade into antiquity as just another half-god spawn of Zeus._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To compete in this contest, players will take on the role of one of these two brothers with access to a powerful array of units including soldiers, beasts, and oracles; each with various uses. Soldiers are powerful, and affect the city they are played in.  Beasts are easily double the strength of the average soldier, but occupy two slots in the player's available army, and may be discarded to access powerful special abilities. The oracles offer passive boons to the player, but leave a lot to be desired in strength._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Omen: A Reign of War is a two-player card game by Small Box Games and features two distinct game modes: standard and draft. The standard game has players drawing cards from a collective deck, and accessing cards from a collective discard pile. The draft game allows players access to their favorite units, with each player drafting his own deck to play the game with._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;................................................................._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Omen: A Reign of War has seen several different editions and expansions since its initial 2011 release.  It is in its current and final edition, the Omega Edition; a streamlined edition incorporating almost all of the previously released content, plus additional new content, for Omen.  It will be the format of the game for any future printings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Omen: A Reign of War - Omega Edition Contents:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    66 Unit Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Feat Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Reward Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Relic Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Challenge Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    5 Whim Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    3 City Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    2 Reference Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    20 Coin Markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;.................................................................._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Omen editions/releases:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     1st Edition (2011) - 24 Units, with multiple copies of each unit, 12 Feats and 12 Reward Cards.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $7 (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

English second edition (including Shattered Aegis expansion and big wood coins), gently played a few times in a smoke- and pet-free home.
SHIPPING:
   USA: $9.90 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>For sale is a copy of the latest Olympus Edition, complete with all original components, and played with gently only once (and not using all the cards). Short of a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;CSI_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-grade inspection, there is no detectable wear on the components.
I am the original owner of the game. I purchased it recently, but found that my primary gaming partner wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t as crazy about it as I was, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it in as new condition as possible. At least we both agree that the artwork is beautiful.
As the game is published by Small Box Games, the box is small and fits nicely inside the smallest USPS flat rate box. Hence, I expect that the shipping cost will be around $5.00, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll provide an exact price once I know the destination ZIP code.
In addition (and preferable) to PayPal, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to accept payment via Google Wallet or Simple Instant transfer.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the English Second Edition, from the KICKSTARTER campaign! Opened and partially sleeved but unplayed.
It includes:
- The Base Game
- The Shattered Aegis Expansion (incorporated into 2E)
- The Forgotten Oath expansion (Kickstarter exclusive!)(NIS)
- Echoes of Myth Expansion (NIS)
- More than enough of the custom sleeves (add-on from the Kickstarter campaign) to sleeve everything.Five packs to be precise, but I sleeved some cards already and have 3.5 packs not yet in use. I sleeved the Reward cards in clear FFG sleeves since they have different backs.
- 60 of the KS exclusive metal coins with the owl back (that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 20 more than backers for for free. I paid extra for more! They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re also great to use with Cyclades.)
- Custom box that holds everything.
Check out my other items in the Marketplace. (I also have Hemloch, another game by Small Box Games.) I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll entertain reasonable offers for multiple purchases and combine shipping!

+ [thing=118052]Expansion: Forgotten Oath[/thing]
+ [thing=138243]Expansion: Echoes of Myth[/thing]
+ Kickstarter exclusive: 40 awesome metal coins[/i][/b] (see image below)
+ [thing=132981][b][i]Expansion: Relics of Olympus[/b][/i][/thing]
This is the edition that, unlike the Olympus version: 
* supports 4 player
* has multiple copies of cards, providing a different gaming experience even in the 2 player game. 
* has twice as many metal coins 
This set for sale also includes the Relics expansion, which is not included in the Olympus version.
[b]Condition:[/b] Box opened, main deck out of shrink.  Game is otherwise unplayed, expansion decks are in shrink (if they came that way), and everything is pristine.
[b]Payment:[/b] Amazon.com gift card is preferred.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take Paypal if necessary.  US money orders and checks accepted, though shipping will be delayed until clearing.
[b]International:[/b] I will consider selling to most locations internationally if the user has some trade and marketplace reputation and pays for mailing insurance.  Also be aware that mailing costs can be very expensive.

    <notes>Very good only because we played it once.  Cards are in like new condition.  Tokens punched.
One corner of the box (top box piece) is torn, it came that way from small box games.  Could be taped and work fine.  
Shipping: Small flat rate box. (2017 rate is $7.15)  or first class bubble mailer $5
This is a small box and could probably be slipped into another game box so consider purchasing another game from me and this will probably ship for no additional charge!</notes>

    <notes>This is the KS 2014 deluxe version of the game. The game is unplayed and thus new. 
Please note: 
The game was never in shrink (at least it did not arrive in shrink wrap), but the two card packages and the metal coins are still in shrink. 
And the game is in English.
If you would like to see any additional pictures, just send me a geekmail and I will happily provide them.
And if you have any questions, please ask!
Please note: I will ship to Germany (tracking optional) and to EU (only with tracking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; insurance)!
Shipping costs:
to Germany - 2,7 Euro (Deutsche Post Maxibrief ohne Tracking und Versicherung, beides optional auf Wunsch als DHL-Paket für 5 Euro oder 4,8 Euro Maxibrief Einschreiben)
to Austria - 4 Euro (DHL small package includes tracking and insurance)
other EU - 6,3 Euro (registered mail includes tracking and insurance)
Payment method A (preferred): via transfer to my EU bank account via IBAN/BIC in advance
Payment method B: via PayPal. Please note that if you choose this option, I would ask you to split the PayPal fee evenly. In this case, 1 Euro/2 -_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 0,5 Euro.
So the total price will be 33,5 Euro + shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Omen a Reign of War is my absolute favorite game of all time!  I literally keep a back up copy of this game just in case anything were to happen to my main copy of Omen.  However, I ordered an extra copy to give away as a gift, so I have 3 total copies of the game, and I think its time to part ways with 1 of those!
This includes a good to very good (depending on how picky you are) condition copy of Omen a Reign of War Olympus Edition (from Kickstarter). 
Games sold typically have a tracking label and are dropped off at FedEx in less than 24 hours from when payment is received. We work super fast to ensure you get your games in no time flat.
Shipping is a flat $7 for continental US addresses. This includes tracking and insurance. We ship via FedEx Ground from sweet home Alabama.  (I can probably also put this in a padded mailing envelope and ship via USPS Priority Mail for the same price, which normally only takes 2-3 days transit if you would prefer a faster option, but in a padded envelope instead of a box).
Paypal is our preferred method of payment, however if you would like to ship outside of the US or want to use a separate payment method, simply drop us a private message for more information. 
We typically respond to messages in an hour or less.</notes>

    <notes>The second edition of Omen comes with the Shattered Aegis expansion and multiple copies of every card, making it a better fit for deckbuilding and other customization than subsequent editions. We played this a few times, so the cards show minor wear, but other than that the game is in great shape. I separated the decks and provided a couple sleeves for each players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; starting cards.
U.S. shipping will probably be ~$8 for USPS Priority.</notes>
