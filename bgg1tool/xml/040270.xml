   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uml;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- H.P.

Lovecraft and his literary circle. In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One of the major appeals of the Living Card Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;reg; format is that it gives you not only a solid game experience, full of strategy and excitement, but it also allows you to customize your gaming experience to your liking. As you customize your deck from the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game card pool, you get to build a strategy around your personal play style._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game was originally a CCG, having been transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Monthly Asylum Pack expansions to the card pool were eventually supplanted by larger quarterly(-ish) expansion boxes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;FFG ended development and organized play support for the game in 2015. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even death may die._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I bought this game and liked it, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get anyone else to play it with me!  So regretfully I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cut my losses and sell it.  Condition is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; -- only played it a couple times.  I also bought two expansion packs -- _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mountains of Madness_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (opened, never used) and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ancient Horrors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (never even opened).  So you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting the complete Call of Cthulhu LCG plus two expansion packs ... an excellent deal, if I do say so myself.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold things on eBay under the name _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;profdiamond_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; so you can reference me there. This is my first time selling on BGG.com, so email me if you have any questions, and thanks!

    <notes>I have a variety of things for sale:
CCG Eldritch premium starter-sealed, came with 6 exclusive cards, Deep One rising, On the Lamb, and 4 others I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember-$12.00
25 Syndicate tokens-deep red clear acrylic triangles with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;$_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; etched onto one side.  They look like the $ was supposed to be painted but never was.  There is tan contact paper over the rest of the piece, you could paint in the $ before removing the contact paper.  Each is about 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or 17 mm tall. -$5.00
and the rare and limited Yithian Deck-played twice, kept in sleeves the whole time, a mint as an open pack can be.  The last one on ebay went for $170 so I put this one up for $125.00
Shipping to payed by the buyer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get an exact amount from the PO before invoicing. 
My local games store still has some of the older CCG booster, APs (including the first series), well picked through singles, and starters available.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re after older stuff, I can put you in contact with them.  I do have my CCG collection still, 4 of each common _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; uncommon, 3-4 copies of each rare with a few exceptions  (less than optimal cards like Cairo Mercenary for instance).  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not actively looking to sell them all, but if someone makes a good offer for the lot......(no individual card sales at this time)</notes>

Agency detectives , Miskatonic University students and faculty, and the members of the mysterious Syndacite all join the fight against otherworldly beings including Cthluhu, Hastur, Yog-Sothoth, and Shub Niggurath.

As a Living Card Game, hundreds of addtional Cards are available for all seven factions, allowing players to customize the contents of this set, or create thier own original decks.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - Call of Cthulhu LCG: Core Set
Language: English
Players: 2
Age: 13+
Duration: 30 to 60 min
Weight: 1.170 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die. Something awful lurks at the fringe of human awareness, dead gods that stir in their slumber, other worlds that press in against our own. A struggle over the fates of men is raging, and you are at its heart. Take command of brave but desperate human investigators or the monstrous and depraved servants of the Ancient Ones. The Call of Cthulhu Living Card Game is a brand new incarnation of the Call of Cthulhu CCG, compatible with all previous releases. Start your game experience with the Core Game, featuring several decks that can be combined in near-infinite deck combinations, Cthulhu figurines, and essential game aids for an immersive Call of Cthulhu experience. Expand your collection with monthly Asylum Packs, adding new cards, new strategies, and new horrors.

    <notes>This copy of the game has never been played.  
It comes with the original box, but the plastic box insert has been removed.  The box has some corner/edge wear.
This game is complete and contains the original 165 cards from the Call of Cthulhu: LCG Core Set.  Also includes 6 Domain cards and 10 Story cards from the CCG as a bonus.  All of these cards are sleeved with UltraPro penny sleeves and stored in a plastic UltraPro card storage box.
Contains the 36 original doubled-sided Wound/Success Tokens.  Also includes 36 red glass counters as a bonus.
Contains 6 Cthulhu Domain Markers.  3 are the original green markers that come with the Core Set, but the other 3 have been upgraded to the superior ink-washed versions.
Contains the original game board and manual.
I ship by USPS Priority Mail. You will pay exactly what the post office charges me for shipping - Geekmail me with your address for a quote. If you ask nicely, I may ship internationally too.
I accept PayPal only.  The Marketplace gives me 3 business days to confirm the order after you place it so, likewise, I expect payment from you within 3 business days of confirmation.

    <notes>Very nice shape, no issues, played a few times but still nice (I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t riffle shuffle, ever, so cards are pristine). Should be a 3 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGCT18)
Ancient, nameless horrors dwell in the darkness, writhing in the night sky and under the earth, just beyond our senses. In Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, players tak the roles of investigators, villians, and unspeakable horrors inspired by the dark mythos of H.P. Lovecraft.

I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money.

Condition - New in shrink wrap
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
Three options are available for delivery within the continental United States - local pickup only in the San Jose, California area, USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate, and FedEx Ground. The cost options are:
FedEx 18 x 14 x 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 5 pounds (one medium size game or two to three small games) - $15.85
FedEx 18 x 14 x 8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 8 pounds (one large or two medium size games) - $21.00
FedEx 18 x 14 x 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 10 pounds (two large or three medium size games) - $26.35
FedEx 24 x 12 x 8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 10 pounds (one extra large game) - $22.00
USPS Priority Mail Medium Flat Rate Box (either configuration, suitable for one medium size or two small games) - $12.65
USPS Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box (either configuration, suitable for one large game or three small games) - $17.15
Local pickup - no charge
Costs include shipping materials. Unless a larger box is specifically requested, shipments by FedEx will be in whatever of the above box sizes best fits the total order with reasonable room for padding (1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; margin minimum on all sides, 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or more preferred). Shipment by USPS will be in whatever flat rate box best fits the game - keep in mind the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;game size_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; flat rate boxes leave very little width or height for padding for standard size games and are not reccomended on that basis. In either case seller is not responsible for damage during transit. Prices for heavier FedEx shipments than listed above will be costed (increased) accordingly. Short hop FedEx shipment prices significantly lower than the above baseline will be costed (decreased) accordingly. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Shipping terms and rates are NOT NEGOTIABLE.</notes>

    <notes>Cards and tokens complete-- tokens are unpunched, and cards are in great shape, they look and feel like they have hardly been played. MISSING all six domain marker figures.  Also the box has one split corner, and is missing the insert.
You can use any kind of pawn or other marker to substitute for the missing domain markers, if you want to use this copy to get into this game fairly inexpensively.  Or this could be a good second core set of cards if you just want more cards.  If that is the case, and you want me to ship only the cards, let me know when you buy so I can set the shipping price correctly.</notes>

    <notes>Selling my collection of games.
This is for everything printed by FFG as part of their retail LCG line (only editions where there were three copies of every card).  This includes three copies worth of cards for the core game (I can give you all three core boxes if you want, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll up shipping), so you have all options.  Also includes some dividers from BrokenToken to help divide factions.
Buyer to pay $25 S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H as this will be a big heavy box.</notes>

I have a pretty large set of CoC. All of the cards were acquired used and are in very good condition. I have not noticed any particular problems. The only boxes I have are the base game ones, which are NOT in great shape, with dings and some split corners. Included in this:
(tl;dr 2x core set, 2 box expansions, 18 asylum packs)

    <notes>This is the base game, plus several of the expansions, played only a couple of times by the previous owner. 
As he wrote when selling, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m afraid I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even remember which ones (expansions) (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all mixed together). It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s definitely a box FULL of cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 
I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played the game since getting it.
Cards are neatly separated in plastic bags. Clean, smoke and odor free. Solid box. If there is an easy way to identify which expansions are in the box, tell me how and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to answer any questions.</notes>
