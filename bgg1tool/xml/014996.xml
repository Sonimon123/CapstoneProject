   <description>Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Ticket to Ride series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Online Play _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Xbox LIVE Arcade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is brand new and has never been played.
From the craggy hillsides of Edinburgh to the sunlit docks of Constantinople, from the dusty alleys of Pamplona to a windswept station in Berlin, Ticket to Ride Europe takes you on a new train adventure through the great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe.
Will you risk a trip through the dark tunnels of Switzerland? Venture aboard a ferry on the Black Sea? Or erect lavish train stations in the great capitals of the old empires? Your next move might just make you Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest train magnate!
The newest installment in our best-selling Ticket to Ride series of train adventures, Ticket to Ride Europe takes you across the Ocean into the heart of Europe. More than just a new map to play on, Ticket to Ride Europe offers you brand new gameplay elements including Tunnels, Ferries and Train Stations. We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also upgraded you to First-Class accommodations with larger cards, new Train Station game pieces, and a lavishly illustrated gameboard.
Like the Spiel des Jahres winning original that has sold over 320,000 copies worldwide, the game remains elegantly simple, and easy to learn. Ticket to Ride Europe is a complete, new game that does not require the original version. It is guaranteed to offer you hours of enjoyment.

    <notes>Game and box are in nice shape, cards are well cared for.  Played only a few times.
The actual weight might vary slightly after packing; I just give an honest guess, in this case 3 pounds.  I ship via USPS from zip 80015.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing or handling, and will use the lower of Flat Rate ($9.30 now, but it creeps up now and then) or Priority Mail, or Parcel Post if you prefer.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Days of Wonder (DOW7202)
From the craggy hillsides of Edinburgh to the sunlit docks of Constantinople, from the dusty alleys of Pamplona to a windswept station in Berlin, Ticket to Ride Europe takes you on a new train adventure through the great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe.
Will you risk a trip through the dark tunnels of Switzerland? Venture aboard a ferry on the Black Sea? Or erect lavish train stations in the great capitals of the old empires? Your next move might just make you Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest train magnate!
The newest installment in our best-selling Ticket to Ride series of train adventures, Ticket to Ride Europe takes you across the Ocean into the heart of Europe. More than just a new map to play on, Ticket to Ride Europe offers you brand new gameplay elements including Tunnels, Ferries and Train Stations. We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also upgraded you to First-Class accommodations with larger cards, new Train Station game pieces, and a lavishly illustrated gameboard.
Like the Spiel des Jahres winning original, the game remains elegantly simple,</notes>

    <notes>English Edition Base Game with Europa 1912 Expansion. Europa 1912 Expansion does not come with original box. Only one black train is missing, but game comes with three extra of each color train, so still fully playable. No other components are missing. Played a few times, but components are in very good to like new condition. Small crack in insert which does not affect how components stay in place. Comes with central printout for cards and 4 player aids, both printed from files on boardgamegeek. 
If you want to see any other pictures of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s components, I would be happy to post them. Just geekmail me with any requests or questions.</notes>
