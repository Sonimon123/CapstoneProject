   <description>Massive Darkness brings the classic fantasy RPG experience to modern board gaming, with an action-packed campaign chock full of gorgeous miniatures and a streamlined system that keeps the focus on the heroes' actions, with no need for a game master to control the enemies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Using the popular Zombicide system as a starting point, Massive Darkness adds all the richness of a dungeon crawl RPG. Pick your hero, choose a class, decide on which skills to spend your XP, and get loot by searching the dungeon or killing special enemies that can use the equipment against you! Face a multitude of different enemy types, coming in all shapes and sizes, whose behavior is resolved automatically...or you can try to sneak around enemies by taking advantage of dark areas of the map._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players begin their adventure in Massive Darkness by picking a Hero _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; each with two special starting skills _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and pair them with a Class of their choosing. Depending on the combination, another skill can be unlocked, giving players a wide range of choices and play styles. In Massive Darkness, the created Heroes go on Quests, killing monsters, collecting loot, and gaining XP. Players spend their XP to unlock new Skills, growing more powerful as the Quest progresses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Throughout the game, players encounter different monsters, including Minions, Agents, Roaming Monsters, and Bosses. An unique mechanism of the game is the Guardian. Any of the monster types have a chance of spawning as a Guardian, meaning it will use a random piece of equipment in the fight against Heroes. However, if players are able to overcome this difficult encounter, they will acquire that piece of loot!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping is to be computed upon receipt of the game and will be paid for by buyer.  I will find the most cost effective shipping between USPS, Fedex and UPS (I have discounted rates with some) unless you have a specific request.  
If you really like this Genre of game, I am also listing Dreamwars and Dark Souls separately.</notes>

    <notes>The game will ship directly from the US Hub of CMON.
Since I didn´t close my pledgemanager on time, it cant be sent to me from the EU Hub and its is now unaffordable for me to ship it to my homecountry germany.
Therefore I´ll sell my lightbringer pledge to an US resident.</notes>

This is for the Optional Add-ons only. NOT THE BASE GAME. (Reptisaurians, Elementals, and Ratlings). 
I bought my friend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pledge that needed the money, but I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play this game enough to justify all this awesome stuff. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll keep the KS exclusive stuff and be okay. Enjoy!

Kickstarter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Lightbringer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge level and associated stretch goals, plus exclusive add-on Zombicide Black Plague crossover pack.  I paid $139.30 for this through the CMON pledge manager, and at retail it will go for well over $200 - and that wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include all these kickstarter exclusives!
Included items:
1) Massive Darkness Core Box (opened, but unplayed condition - all contents unpunched, cards re-wrapped in plastic)
2) Troglodytes
3) Sorcerers vs Lord Tusk
4) Noble Warriors vs the Cockatrix
5) Chests and Pillars
6) Lightbringer Pack of varied exclusive bosses and heroes (kickstarter stretch goals)
7) Replacement Card Pack (core box replacements already completed, original replaced cards also included)
8) Black Plague Crossover pack
This all ships in the original packaging from CMON directly to you, within 1 business day of receipt of payment!
Stored in a non-smoking home without pets.
Ships via lowest cost trackable and insurable method from among USPS, FedEx, and UPS.</notes>

I would love to delve into the dungeons with all those awesome minis, but with the afflux of great games, and limited shelf space, I have to make tough decisions and sell some... Hopefully this can make someone else who missed on the KS campaign happy! I will ship to the UK only, the shipping cost should be around 10£.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete all-in Kickstarted Edition of Massive Darkness.
ACHTUNG: this set will only be *sold as a whole*. i *will not* separate individual pieces for sale, and questions/requests to that effect *will be politely ignored*.
Photo album: https://photos.app.goo.gl/3MgT8GQrJ8NDhWym1
(The bottom-most photos depict the bundle as a whole.)
Differences from a brand-new set:
- It has been opened and played about half a dozen times, but:
-- All cards, except for the (unused) Zombie Black Plague crossover bits, have been sleeved from the moment they left their boxes, and are therefore in pristine condition. Sleeves are included in the sale.
-- All boxes, books, and tiles are in like-new condition.
-- None of the minis are painted, but all of the minis except for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;common mobs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are labeled on their undersides.
-- About a dozen of the character record sheets have been laminated or sleeved, but the rest are unused.
-- The edges of many of the tokens have been colored over with a marker to improve their appearance (see the photo album).
This bundle includes:
- The core game.
- All stretch goals, exclusives, and add-ons from the KS campaign:
-- One set of each of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;frost_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;marble_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; dice sets (and the pretty black dice bag)
-- The plastic token set
-- The 3D Chests+Pillars and Doors+Bridges packs
-- An extra set of tiles (unopened) for both the core game and Crystal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Lava campaign
-- Reptisaurians
-- Troglodytes
-- Ratlings
-- Elementals
-- Sorcerers vs. Lord Tusk
-- Warrior Priests vs. The Spearmaiden Cyclops
-- Bloodmoon Assassins vs. The Hellephant
-- Noble Warriors vs. The Cockatrix
-- The Zombicide Black Plague crossover cards.
-- The reprinted/errata_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d character and monster cards.
All of the boxes include the original plastic blister packaging, but the minis are not stored in them.
It also includes the following _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;extras_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;:
- ALL of the cards, except for the (unused) ZBP crossover bits, are sleeved using docsmagic.de-brand thin sleeves.
- Three plastic organizer boxes (approx. 25 Euro value): a small one holding the tokens and two large ones holding all of the minis except for the Cyclops and Reptisaurus (neither of which fit in any reasonably-sized organizer box and both of which are stored in their respective expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box).
- Sleeves for the character record sheets. They fit the sheets perfectly if one trims about 2mm from the top and bottom edges of the sheets (this does not trim any of the text, just the extraneous border)
SHIPPING NOTES:
- The package ships from southern Germany and weighs approximately 12.5kg, so postage costs will be appropriately high:
-- 16.50 Euros if shipped within Germany
-- 34(!) to all EU countries outside of Germany
-- Source: https://www.dhl.de/de/privatkunden/preise/preise-international.html
- If you come by and pick up the set, i will reduce the price by 30 Euros (plus you save on shipping).
Reason for selling: i_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m simply not feeling it. This game was marketed as the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;next evolutionary step_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in Zombicide, yet the only thing it has in common with Zombicide is the size of the components (minis and board tiles).
Feel free to contact me (in English or German) with any questions *EXCEPT for the following*:
1) As mentioned above, i will *ignore* any requests to separate and sell individual components. This set will be sold only as a whole. NO EXCEPTIONS.
2) The listed price is non-negotiable (unless, of course, you want to negotiate upwards!). Part of that price accounts for me having to hand-carry the Massive Package 2km to the nearest post office to ship it.</notes>

Buyer pays shipping to anywhere in the US. There is a lot of stuff so it could get a bit pricey but happy to find the best rate for you. I live in Myrtle Beach, SC 29588 so a local pickup if you are in the area could save you on shipping.
I have played a few times, I would consider everything to be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I have a used few of the character class sheets from a few pads. Still plenty left. I have also consolidated many of the pieces into the Core box and the Stretch Goals box but I kept all of the original boxes and packaging. Happy to ship it to you either way.
Also willing to consider trades! Thanks for looking</notes>

This is everything currently available for Massive Darkness except the Elementals box, extra tile set and frost dice.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d also like to add that this is the actual cost of my pledge. No scalping.  Everything has been opened and verified, the expansions are still sealed, but the boxes have been opened for inspection and to add the relevant replacement cards.  I played the tutorial scenario and decided it was great, but not for me, and boxed it all up again.  So it is basically in like new condition.</notes>

Everything has been condensed into 2 boxes (stretch goals box and main box) I have all the boxes if they are wanted but this will cost more to ship. some of the inserts have been removed or cut to get the minis to a single box.
It has been played once only the first mission, and is in a non-smoking no pet household.
It is a heavy box so shipping will likely not be cheap</notes>

    <notes>I sell the Massive Darkness Lightbringer Pledge here.
The package contains everything from the Kickstarter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Lightbringer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge
and additionally contains the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Zombicide Cross Over_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Pack and an extra set of dice (marble optic).
The game is unplayed and unpunched. So the condition is like new.
One of the expansions (Troglodytes) is still in shrink.
Customer pays for shipping (inside Germany it will be about 6,-€ and in europe about 16,-€ with DHL). But the game can also be picket up directly in Hamburg.
If you have questions feel free to ask.</notes>
