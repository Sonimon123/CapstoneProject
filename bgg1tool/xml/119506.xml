   <description>Early in the history of the United States, slavery was an institution that seemed unmovable but with efforts of men and women across the country, it was toppled. In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Freedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Freedom - The Underground Railroad is an engaging cooperative game about a pivotal time in American history. Players assume the roles of important historical Abolitionist characters pitted against the slave economy from the early 1800_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s thru the Civil War. Players succeed together by balancing their actions between raising funds for the Abolitionist cause and helping slaves as they move from the Southern States to freedom in Canada. But every move risks alerting the slave catchers, who roam the board trying to return the runaway slaves back to the plantations. </notes>

Freedom - The Underground Railroad is an engaging cooperative game about a pivotal time in American history. Players assume the roles of important historical Abolitionist characters pitted against the slave economy from the early 1800_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s thru the Civil War. Players succeed together by balancing their actions between raising funds for the Abolitionist cause and helping slaves as they move from the Southern States to freedom in Canada. But every move risks alerting the slave catchers, who roam the board trying to return the runaway slaves back to the plantations. </notes>

    <notes>Selling this game is painful because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a huge fan, but need the money badly.
The game is mint condition except for two cards have a crease in them (kind of like a slight wrinkle).  They came this way (game was handled very carefully) and the crease is not very noticeable.  
This comes with Kickstarter slave catcher wooden pawns and the extra kickstarter reserve cards which are still sealed.  I do not believe it comes with the other two decks of kickstarter cards but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not positive because they are sealed.
Shipping will be $12.</notes>

    <notes>This is the (beautiful) Kickstarter Edition, complete with all the stretch goal bonus items. The shrink is off, but the counters are unpunched, the cards are still wrapped, and all the bits are still in their baggies. This game is as close to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as you can come without the shrinkwrap.</notes>

    <notes>ACADEMY GAMES (AYG5401)
Freedom - The Underground Railroad is an engaging cooperative game about a pivotal time in American history. Players assume the roles of important historical Abolitionist characters pitted against the slave economy from the early 1800_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s through the Civil War. Players succeed together by balancing their actions between raising funds for the Abolitionist cause and helping slaves as they move from the Southern States to freedom in Canada. But every move risks alerting the slave catchers, who roam the board trying to return the runaway slaves back to the plantations.</notes>

    <notes>Academy Games (AYG5401)
Freedom - The Underground Railroad is an engaging cooperative game about a pivotal time in American history. Players assume the roles of important historical Abolitionist characters pitted against the slave economy from the early 1800_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s through the Civil War. Players succeed together by balancing their actions between raising funds for the Abolitionist cause and helping slaves as they move from the Southern States to freedom in Canada. But every move risks alerting the slave catchers, who roam the board trying to return the runaway slaves back to the plantations.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Limited Signed Edition.  I removed the outer shrinkwrap to include the extras - the signed sticker, a sealed mini of a kerosene lantern (there may have been more extras but I really do not remember - I just know that I put everything inside the box).  The components are not punched and the game has never been played.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>For shipping purposed my zip code is 10950. I ship using USPS and will charge you the actual rate.  
If the shipping destination is on the west coast, usually Flat Rate priority mail will work best.  For most games, the Medium Flat Rate Box will fit, and this is a flat rate of $13.45.   For ‘taller’ games, the large flat rate box will be needed which costs a flat rate of $18.75.  Of course, I’ll verify that the flat rate box is the best option before responding with the shipping charge.
For closer destinations, I’ll determine the lowest cost option for USPS and charge that amount.   
Bottomline - In cases, you’ll pay what I pay for shipping and I’ll try to find the least cost option.  
Also, there can be some big advantages in saving money on shipping by combining multiple games into one box.</notes>

    <notes>The Box was unfortunately damaged by the delivery service. Even the board got some damage from that, but it is very usable. It is just very puzzling to see.  Everything else however is fine and nothing is missing or unusable. It is still a rare and elegantly designed game that is hard to get in europe. Shipping costs wiil once I know the destination.</notes>
