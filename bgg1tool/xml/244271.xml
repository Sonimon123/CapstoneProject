    <notes>Opened and punched. Unplayed. This is the huge battlechest edition (came with promo card pack, comic, and big ass box). I did open the promo card pack to verify everything was there (season 1 promos, season 2 promos, and randomizers).
Shipping will be precise. While big, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not super heavy. I would estimate shipping at $10 for east coast, and $20 for west.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink.  Includes Kickstarter bonuses (2018 promo card pack and comic book).  The box cover has a very minor wrinkle/crease in one corner, which is hardly noticeable, but I still want to disclose it for anyone who is extremely particular about the box condition.
Free shipping within contiguous US (I will use the cheapest shipping option available to me, which to most locations will be UPS Ground).</notes>
