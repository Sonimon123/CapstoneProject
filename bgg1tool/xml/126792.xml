   <description>In Myrmes, originally shown under the name ANTerpryse, players control ant colonies and use their ants to explore the land (leaving pheromones in their wake); harvest _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;crops_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; like stone, earth and aphids; fight with other ants; complete requests from the Queen; birth new ants; and otherwise dominate their tiny patch of dirt, all in a quest to score points and prove that they belong at the top of the heap, er, anthill. After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what's going on inside his colony _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't. Whoever has the most points after three years wins. All hail our new ant overlords!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

 In the kingdom of Myrmes, the ant colonies have been fighting for centuries to dominate their neighbors. To put an end to this war, the council of the queens has decreed that a final battle will decide the issue of the final victory. Send your soldiers and your workers to assault of the kingdom. Fill up your larder, hunt down insects and wisely place your pheromones to conquer the territory. But most importantly, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t forget to prepare for winter! </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO488)
In the kingdom of Myrmes, the ant colonies have been fighting for centuries to establish dominance over their neighbors. To put an end to this struggle, the council of queens has decreed that a final competition will settle once and for all which colony can claim to be the strongest. Send your soldiers and your workers ants out into the garden to hunt down insects or place pheromones, which allow you to claim new territory and increase the distance your ants can travel on future forays. Perhaps most importantly, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t forget to prepare for winter! </notes>

To put an end to this struggle, the council of queens has decreed that a final competition will settle once and for all which colony can claim to be the strongest. Send your soldiers and your workers ants out into the garden to hunt down insects or place pheromones, which allow you to claim new territory and increase the distance your ants can travel on future forays.

    <notes>Condition - Punched, played twice. Box is in excellent condition with very light shelf wear. Contents are in excellent condition, looking fresh punched. Includes corrected tiles.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game and colony tiles expansion.  I have the English Rio Grande edition.  There were originally some tiles misprinted.  I have the corrected tiles, but I have the mistakes in the box - they are in a bag and marked.  Other than the tiles that had to be replaced, the components are not punched and the game has never been played.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO488)
In the kingdom of Myrmes, the ant colonies have been fighting for centuries to establish dominance over their neighbors. To put an end to this struggle, the council of queens has decreed that a final competition will settle once and for all which colony can claim to be the strongest. Send your soldiers and your workers ants out into the garden to hunt down insects or place pheromones, which allow you to claim new territory and increase the distance your ants can travel on future forays. Perhaps most importantly, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t forget to prepare for winter! </notes>
