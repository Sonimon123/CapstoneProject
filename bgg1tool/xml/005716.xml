   <description>In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; two plains alternating with two mountains _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; mountains becomes plains and vice-versa _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>999 Games - Ballonrace
Language: Dutch
Players: 2
Age: 8+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.290 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards, two Plains alternating with two Mountains, are laid out and 1, 2, 3 or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added. From a hand of 8 Balloon cards must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent’s side - a move that can really ruin the opponent’s plans. High-valued balloons are played on the Mountains and low-valued balloons on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over and refilled with cubes. Mountains becomes Plains and vice-versa. 5 Trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the Trophy card for that color. Players may even trade 3 otherwise useless cubes for 1 they can use. The first player to earn 3 trophy cards is the winner!

This game comes in a Kosmos 2-player box, so shipping in the United States should be around $6 for Priority Mail.</notes>

    <notes>999 Games - Ballonrace
Language: Dutch
Players: 2
Age: 8+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.290 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards, two Plains alternating with two Mountains, are laid out and 1, 2, 3 or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added. From a hand of 8 Balloon cards must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent’s side - a move that can really ruin the opponent’s plans. High-valued balloons are played on the Mountains and low-valued balloons on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over and refilled with cubes. Mountains becomes Plains and vice-versa. 5 Trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the Trophy card for that color. Players may even trade 3 otherwise useless cubes for 1 they can use. The first player to earn 3 trophy cards is the winner!

    <notes>I would almost rate this as Like New, but for the scuffs on the box corners and some indication on the edges of the cards that the game has been played.
This game has been played about 10 times and is in excellent condition except for those things noted above.

A medium size flate-rate box would be overkill for this. Flate-rate postage for a medium box would be $11.35, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only going to charge you $9 for shipping, but it will come Priority in a normal box (assuming that is acceptable to you. I can use a medium flat-rate box if you prefer, at cost)</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande English version.  
The box has definitely seen some wear, but the Cards are in great condition with very little wear.  Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been played with much.  All the wooden cubes are present as well.
Shipping should be around $8 for US.  More for international.</notes>

    <notes>Game is unwrapped but only played a couple times very gently. Cards look new. All components present... The Germans make some really nice quality playing cards, by the way.
Will ship however you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pay for, from zip code 94704.
Feel free to combine shipping with any of the other games I have for sale: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=trader%20joe
I suggest the flat-rate Priority Mail rate for this small game, if within the US, but just let me know how you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to ship and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll add it.
All my games are from a smoke and cat-free house.</notes>

The components are neat and clean and the cards were sleeved and I will send the game with the sleeves.  I am a careful packer and only use new sturdy cardboard boxes.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition and complete. This edition contains a cloth drawstring bag. All game components are language independent.
Played only one or two times; cards and other components look like new. In fact I would actually consider this to be Like New condition, but BGG says that means right after the shrink was removed. Since I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it a couple of times, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m saying Very Good to be conservative.
Shipping by USPS priority or parcel (your choice). Shipping weight 1-2 lbs. (doing my best to find a box that will keep it at 1 lb.). Price does not include shipping.</notes>
