   <description>Formula D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute; is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack.  This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly.   Great fun for a big group._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The base game comes with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;

    <notes>Everything is complete and all of the components are in excellent, very good to like new condition.  Unfortunately, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the box that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s taken a slight beating.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some slight wear across the top, the edges and the corners are scuffed and worn away, and the bottom of the box is caved in a bit.  I can post pictures upon request.  But, if you can look past some slight (how slight depends on your perceptions of and sensitivity to box damage) cosmetic issues, then here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a great game for you in really good condition.

BONUS! Includes an extra complete set of gear dice, extra pad of unused race sheets, and an unopened pack of 10 pewter formula-one cars.
Contents verified complete.  The original pad is about half-used, with the other sheets marked with pencil.  The plastic cars have been assembled. The box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s appearance is excellent except for the upper left bottom corner which is dented.
I am also selling Eurogames_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Formula De tracks #3 - #30, most of which are still in shrinkwrap.</notes>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Euro Games, 19xx? - Formula De (original Descartes version) - COMPLETE. Outer box is in excellent condition with only minimal shelfwear in a couple of the (bottom of cover) corners.  Interior contents are also in excellent condition.  A handful of the track sheets were used (but mostly we just photocopied and cut, to keep from using the originals).  The black plastic insert has a small crack in the top right corner (came from the manufacturer that way).  Everything still very clean and crisp (comes from personal collection).  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 5.5 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Communication: (please read before buying)
I will email you once an item has been bought providing you with shipping options prior to the confirmation (payment) email. If I do not hear back from you within three (3) days by email (either through bgg-mail or personal email (to my hotmail account) I will cancel the purchase.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through paypal but will also accept moneyorders if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $0.85 (for delivery confirmation). Insurance is optional but recommended. I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Although I no longer sell on Ebay, you can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks.
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Thanks,
Jon

    <notes>Components inside very nice in this unplayed version of the game. The only bad part, I received the game with a hole in the box bottom. Sealed it with clear tape. Otherwise, box is sound and like I said, the stuff inside is great.  Smoke free home.</notes>

    <notes>The game:
German version from Euro Games.
All game parts are in very good condition.
Two sets of dice are included, plus extra pad of score sheets.
The cardboard/plastic inlet is missing.
The box shows light shelf wear.
Shipping:
All shipping is done via DHL. Shipping costs depend on size and weight of the parcel and destination. 
Payment:
Within EU I prefer the EU-standard-bank-tranfer (SEPA,IBAN/BIC). It is fast and causes no fees.
Outside EU Paypal and bank-transfer are possible.

    <notes>Immaculate condition - fresh out of the wrap.
A few very tiny scuffs on the box in keeping with the age of the game but the contents are unused and unplayed.
The cars themselves are on the sprues, apart from one car - see this picture: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1619656/itchyrichy
The paper pad is complete and new, everything is bagged and fresh.
Shipping £7.00 for the UK only.  
It can be sent overseas but you have to accept the high cost of shipping AND the delay it takes to arrive (in my experience it can be up to two months!) so be warned.
PayPal Only.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
