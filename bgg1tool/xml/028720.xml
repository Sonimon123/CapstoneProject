   <description>Brass: Lancashire _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; first published as Brass _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Build an industry tile_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Build a rail or canal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Develop an industry_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Sell cotton_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Take a loan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 101081N)
Brass is set in 18th century Lancashire at the beginning of what would eventually be called the Industrial Revolution. It starts at the beginning of the Canal Age and ends after the development of railways. Players take the roles of entrepreneurs attempting to make the most money from the various industries of the time. Cotton dominates the game but players ignore the other industries such as coal mining and engineering at their peril.

    <notes>Brass is set in 18th century Lancashire at the beginning of what would eventually be called the Industrial Revolution. It starts at the beginning of the Canal Age and ends after the development of railways. Players take the roles of entrepreneurs attempting to make the most money from the various industries of the time. Cotton dominates the game but players ignore the other industries such as coal mining and engineering at their peril.
Your goal in Brass is to build cotton mills, coal mines, iron works, canals, railways, ports, and shipyards, and to have them be used so that they score points. Your choices will be limited by the cards you draw, but not as much as by the plans you make. Lots of interesting detail in the historical Lancashire setting.

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101081N)
Your goal in Brass is to build cotton mills, coal mines, iron works, canals, railways, ports, and shipyards, and to have them be used so that they score points. Your choices will be limited by the cards you draw, but not as much as by the plans you make. Lots of interesting detail in the historical Lancashire setting. </notes>

Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.65 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 9.95
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 13.40
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 19.65
Registered Post: (Including 1.65 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 14.55
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 18.45
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 24.70
Registered post everywhere else. 
Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>

    <notes>The Industrial Revolution in Lancashire is the story of this game. Players build coal mines, iron works and cotton mills through the canal and railway ages. However, they need to balance construction with improving technology and income with victory points. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s another clever, challenging game from Martin Wallace.

    <notes>To tell you the truth I have no idea what edition this is. I will look figure it out if someone is interested. We have played this about 2 times, but the App replaced the game for us (which is odd, typically the Apps are not very good). 
Shipping will be $12 or less, if you are near NC I will find a smaller box that will make it cheaper. Let me know and I can run you a quote.</notes>

Weight: 2lb 13oz
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m prepared to listen to an offer, and would be more likely to consider if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying several game. Low-ball offers are likely to be ignored.
*** All games on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; list will be listed eventually - feel free to look through them and make offers ***
Shipping is done from 33947 via USPS Priority or Ground service, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to keep your costs down using Flat-rate and Regional-rate boxes if that works out cheapest. If you want a rough estimate of the shipping cost use the calculator at usps.com. Total the weight of all the games, then add a lb or two for the box plus packing materials. I ship to mainland US addresses only. (A couple of bad experiences.)
Payments via personal PayPal transfers are preferred (extra charged for cover any fees), but checks, money orders, cash, and other options considered. 
Not looking for any trades at this point, but may consider 18xx games.</notes>

    <notes>The game comes from a private collection (non-smoking and pet-free environment).
It has been opened but never played. All components are in excellent condition.
The box lid is still in its original shrink wrap for extra protection. It can be easily removed in case you find it unnecessary. I’m simply very picky about game condition and like to give my games this extra protection :)

    <notes>The Deluxe edition of this classic game - new and in shrink wrap.
I have backed this on Kickstarter along with Brass: Birmingham, and as my hometown appears on the Birmingham Edition I have decided to keep that one, so this is now available to anyone wishing to buy it.
It contains the new, refreshed base game, better quality components, enhanced rules, player mats, and more - see the kickstarter page for more information (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roxley/brass-an-industrial-revolution)
It also contains the 70 Iron Clay poker chips which can be used in this and other games instead of coins and are really rather nice!
If you have any questions, please drop me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get back to you as soon as possible. Also, if you wish to order Hope (the other game I am selling), I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll provide a discount of 10% on the total price e.g. £60+£35 = £95 - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll make the price £85</notes>
