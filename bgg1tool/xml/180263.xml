Shipping will be calculated according to destination via EMS.  The package is very heavy so international shipping will be quite high.  Estimated shipping EMS (4-5 days tracking/insured) to US mainland is 80 dollars with abundant extra padding and protection.

    <notes>Kickstarter copy of the 7th Continent including the cards from three expansions: Swamp of Madness, the Forbidden Sanctuary, and the Icy Maze. The game has been played twice unsleeved. All expansion cards were sorted into the main box and expansion boxes were discarded. The box cover has a small wrinkle in the corner. All cards are in good or better condition, many having never been handled other than to sort into the box.
I will ship via UPS Ground. Shipping is $15: I will cover any overage and refund if shipping comes to less than that amount.</notes>

Also contains the 3 extra packs _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Icy Maze_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Forbidden Sanctuary_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Swamp of Madness_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (KS exclusive). All 3 unopened but no other addons.
You will pay full shipping which may be a lot since it is so big and heavy.</notes>

    <notes>Includes all playable content created for the game, including the First Edition base game and all expansion materials (including playable add-ons) produced in the first Kickstarter, shipped to you immediately. Includes 200 premium Mayday sleeves sized for the game, and a bunch of Mayday penny sleeves as well. 
AND
The expansion big box from the second kickstarter, and all other expansion materials (including playable add-ons). I will update the pledge manager with your address, and you will receive your expansions when Wave 2 ships (estimated October, 2018). At the moment, the only non-playable content I have backed from the second kickstarter is the bone dice add-on. But if you wish to add more materials, I can do so through the Pledge Manger for additional cost.
Shipping for both the first edition content (shipped from 29429) and for the second Kickstarter will be paid by the buyer. Any additional Kickstarter add-ons added to the pledge manager will be paid by the buyer. Seller is not responsible for the timing of the second kickstarter fulfillment. 
Will ship to the United States only.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the 7th Continent: Veteran + New Gampeplay Bundle pledge from the 2017 Kickstarter.
This does NOT include the base game. This is for players who already have the core set.
For first edition owners, this includes the second edition upgrade pack.
Includes:
* What Goes Up Must Come Down Expansion
* Satchel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Journal Binder
* Second Edition Upgrade Pack
* Comfort Creatures Expansion
* The Flying Roots Expansion
* All Stretch Goals
This is a pre-order. The base game is slated for a late Q1/early Q2 2018 delivery with the remainder to be fulfilled in Q3 2018.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to ship separately or wait and ship everything at one time.
Please note, payment for the game will be expected now with an additional payment for shipping as soon as it is delivered. I will do my best to ship this as economically as possible and will work with you to use whichever carrier you prefer.
I will be happy to ship outside of the US, but know that the price for shipping internationally can be expensive.</notes>

    <notes>This first curse on this game has been played three times. Included is:
Kickstarter version of the base game
The five expansions
The bone dice
The explorer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s journal
Sleeves on ALL cards
The corner of the box was slightly crumpled in shipping.
I am a backer for the upcoming expansion. If you would also like to purchase that from me, let me know.
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>

I will be happy to ship outside of the US, but know that the price for shipping internationally can be expensive.</notes>

    <notes>Hi,
ich verkaufe hier meine The 7th Continent _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Rookie + Full Gameplay Bundle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; inklusive aller erschienen Erweiterungen und aller erreichten Stretchgoals. Zusätzlich biete ich in diesem Paket noch die Board Game Geek Promo Karten und das Bone Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bag Packet enthalten. In der Box des Basis-Spiels und der Box der Erweiterung _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;What goes up, must come down_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; können alle Erweiterungen verstaut werden. Ein Sammelsurium an kleinen Boxen entfällt somit.
Insgesamt sind in diesem Paket folgende einzelnen Bestandteile enthalten:
- The 7th Continent “Second Edition” Box (Basisspiel in der zweiten Edition)
- All Stretch Goals from the first campaign (Alle Stretchgoals aus der ersten Kampagne zum Basis-Spiel 2015)
- “What Goes Up, Must Come Down” Box (Die große neue Erweiterung)
- “Satchel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Journal” binder (Verwaltet alle Questitems, die während des Spiels gesammelt werden in einem übersichtlichen Notizbuch)
- “The Icy Maze” curse expansion (Erweiterung mit neuem Fluch aus der ersten Kampagne)
- “Swamp of Madness” curse expansion (Erweiterung mit neuem Fluch aus der ersten Kampagne)
- “The Forbidden Sanctuary” curse expansion (Erweiterung mit neuem Fluch aus der ersten Kampagne)
- “Facing the Elements” expansion (Erweiterung aus der ersten Kampagne)
- “Fear the Devourers” expansion (Erweiterung aus der ersten Kampagne)
- “The Flying Roots” expansion (neue Erweiterung)
- “Comfort Creatures” mini-expansion (neue Erweiterung)
- “Path of Repentance” mini-expansion (Erweiterung aus der ersten Kampagne)
- All Unlocked Stretch Goals (Alle Stretchgoals aus der aktuellen Kampagne zur Erweiterung “What Goes Up, Must Come Down”)
- Bone Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bag (Würfel in Knochenoptik und Würfelbeutel)
- Board Game Geek promo cards (englischsprachige Promokarten, die BoardGameGeek unterstützen)
Die Erweiterung, zusammen mit der Basis-Box in der zweiten Edition wurde letztes Jahr auf Kickstarter finanziert und war der erwartete, große Erfolg. Die Basis-Box inclusive des Bone Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bag Addons kann von wir sofort versandt werden. Das Spiel ist neu, originalverpackt und vollständig in englischer Sprache.
Jetzt sofort kann ich nur die bereits erhaltene Grundbox in der zweiten Edition und die Bone Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bag Addons versenden, weil der Rest erst in einer zweiten Welle versand wird. Die Erweiterungen erwarte ich für Oktober und werden sie nach erhalt umgehend weiter versenden
Leider habe ich mittlerweile keinen Platz mehr um dieses großartige Spiel zu behalten und muss es daher leider verkaufen.
Ich berechne keine weiteren Versandkosten für das Gesamtpaket.
Zahlen könnt ihr mit Paypal, Überweisung oder auch Bar bei Abholung.

    <notes>Selling my entire rookie pledge (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed it both here and under _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;What Goes Up..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as I was not sure where folks would look first).  
The base game is in hand and ready to ship. Base game is open as I played through the first curse once and reset the game before deciding the game is not for me. Everything is complete, but cards are open and all cardboard components unpuched and assembled (I will have to unassemble the discard pile holder for shipping). This box weighs 9 pounds and measures 14 x 14 x 6 (you can use this info at USPS.com to calculate shipping from 85284 to your ZIP code). PLEASE CHECK OUT THE PICTURES OF THE BASE GAME.
Rest of rookie pledge will be sealed, and will ship when it arrives later this year. The part of the pledge includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;What goes up..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion, and the additional Kickstarter stretch goals. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge a flat $20 for shipping for this part of the pledge. If it costs more than than this to ship, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover the extra cost.
Everything must be paid for up front.
I only ship to U.S. addresses and to buyers with U.S. PayPal accounts.
Please pay as a friend or add 3% to cover fees.</notes>

    <notes>The 7th Continent (English second edition) (2018)
This is the brand new (unopened, in shrink-wrap, received on 4th of April 2018), newest, 2nd-Kickstarter-campaign, English version of the 7th Continent, which includes all stretch goals from the first campaign and many more additions. Will ship to UK only, signed and tracked Royal Mail service for just 5 GBP extra. Payment by Paypal. With extra 15 GBP, I will also include the thematic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Bone Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dice Bag_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (unopened), which was separately shipped by the game developers (Serious Poulp) as a reward.
IMPORTANT: please, buy only if you are fully committed and ready to pay by PayPal within 1-2 days. There seems to be a habit at BGG of people buying this, thus taking the item off the marketplace, then not paying for weeks (already happened twice...). If you order the item, I will issue a confirmation within a day, and if the payment is not received the next day, the order will be cancelled.</notes>

    <notes>Consider this a preorder for October!  I backed at the Rookie Level (base game, stretch goals from 1st campaign, ‘What Comes Up, Must Come Down’ expansion, a couple other things) and also ordered the ‘Explorer Expansions’ through pledge manager (The Icy Maze, Swamp of Madness and The Forbidden Sanctuary expansions).  What I will do is provide you the pledge manager link so you can take control of the shipping and have it delivered to your home.  This is the price I backed at, so I am not seeking a profit.</notes>

    <notes>The game is new and has not been played. All components are within. It is still in the box in which it arrived. It is the first Kickstarter Explorer Level edition (see below for details).
It is a great concept, but it is not a game that will hit the table with my group. It is too much of a sandbox game for my group. As a result, it will not see much play. I am not sure of its true value as some people are charging extremely high prices for the same version of this game (?) here on the market place.
I will ship in the USA using USPS. I will send it as cheaply as possible. Do not ask for a shipping estimate. I am not making two trips to the post office. Shipping costs will likely be between $10-15 dollars.
I will send elsewhere to the world. Do not expect the shipping to be cheap although I will send it as cheaply as possible. Sending games to Pacific nations seems to be more expensive than Europe. Nonetheless, do not expect world-wide shipping to be inexpensive. 
Note: If you make an order and do not pay me and then fail to contact me as to why you have not paid me, I will give you a negative rating. I am taking the time to go to the post office and get you an estimate. I am sending the game as cheaply as possible. Please be an honest buyer.

The cards are partly sleeved - all the action cards, the hunting results, the curses - basically all cards recommended by the FAQ.
Some cards have little markings, but nothing serious - basically careful, but normal usage. Since the cards are numbered and sorted anyway, this will not influence gameplay.
The sleeves are premium sleeves by Docs Magic and are included in the offer.</notes>

    <notes>7TH CONTINENT
NEW UNPLAYED
Box is open and card contents have been counted and sorted.
The game is unplayed, only the cards have been opened.
All other contents are sealed and unpunched.
Cards are all present.
Only minor issue is 2 cards have slight artwork lifted due to being stuck together.
This will not stop you from playing the game.
You can send a message to the publisher, Serious Poulp, to get replacements.
If you want pics of the 2 cards in question, please message me. I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t put them up due to spoilers.
Postage in the uk is £10 with insurance.
Payment by Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Family and Friends_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;</notes>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the early 20th century. You have decided to sail back to the newly discovered seventh continent to attempt to lift the terrible curse that has struck you since your return from the previous expedition.
In The 7th Continent, a solo or cooperative _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;choose-your-own-adventure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; exploration board game, you choose a character and begin your adventure on your own or with a team of other explorers. Inspired by the Fighting Fantasy book series, you will discover the extent of this wild new land through a variety of terrain and event cards. In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons and shelter to ensure your survival.
Unlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)...or die trying.
The 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!</notes>

    <notes>This is for an opened but like new copy of the board game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The 7th continent._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; This game is rated as one of the top 10 board games of all time per BoardGameGeek, which acts as a meta-critic for gamers. This includes all of the kickstarter stretch goals that are applicable and is not available in retail. This makes for a great present to yourself, or even an upcoming gift for Christmas for others.
Buy with confidence. I have 100% satisfied customers and you can see through my reviews I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve already sold a half dozen of these with positive reviews as part of a side business I run. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold over $10,000 in games this year and treat each order with care. 
Shipping costs are only accurate for US buyers. The game will ship in a USPS large flat rate box. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re close to where I live and I can ship it for cheaper than the flat rate box, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund you the difference.
Buyer pays shipping which likely cheapest in a large flat rate box depending on location. I will ship to Canada, but please notify me ahead of time so we can calculate accurate costs of shipping.
Let me know if you have any questions! Enjoy!

All cards have been put back in their general order as best as possible... but there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a lot of cards and a lot of taking out and putting back, but I tried.  All the cards, minis, etc, are in great condition.
There are no expansions included with this, just the base game.

    <notes>This sale is for the Rookie + Full Gameplay Bundle pledge from the second kickstarter in 2017. I have the base game and expected delivery of all the expansions is March 2019.
I have the base game which is in great condition and only played a few times. I will ship the base box UPS as none of the USPS flat rate boxes fit the game. It is also not a light game so shipping could be a little pricey so keep that in mind.
The white box expansion and all the rest of the gameplay add-ons are expected to be delivered March 2019. The pledge manager is open and I will input the shipping details of the buyer into the pledge manager so the rest of the components will ship to you when they are sent out. I will only sell to a resident of the USA as I have already paid the shipping from the kickstarter. What will be needed for the pledge manager once this is purchased is a name, address, and phone number. Also, we could exchange email addresses so I can forward on any future updates on the project.
Please do not pay me as a business in PayPal as they take a fee out and it will be quite large for a sale like this. Also, could do local pickup if around Chicago.
Please reach out if you have any questions as well. Thanks.</notes>
