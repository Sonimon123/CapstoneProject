   <description>In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce. Any notation system you devise must be both flexible and reliable, recording negative information as well as positive in order to tick off the possibilities one by one..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Case of the Elusive Assassin, with the core mechanisms of that game being used in Sleuth, minus the game board, movement and player proximity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The box has one dinged corner and a little bit of wear on some edges.  The contents look like they were played no more than two or three times.  The rules booklet has some faint markings on its back as if it rubbed against a penciled drawing or some such --I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tried but I suspect gentle application of an eraser would make the markings vanish.</notes>

    <notes>Modern Face 2 Face version from 2004.  Game was inspected but never played.  Cards were never shuffled and notepad is 100% full.  Box has extremely minimal shelfwear.  All-in-all, this is a very nice copy of Sleuth.
Shipping within the USA will be $4.50.  International shipping varies but will probably be around $10.  Please message me for an exact quote though prior to purchasing.  Thanks for looking and check out my other games for sale.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent shape, pretty much as new.  Only read rules a few times, cards unplayed.
Should be a 2 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Face 2 Face Games (F2F 003)
Absolutely genuine classic deduction game from the master designer Sid Sackson. There are two decks, one normal size, 36 cards showing 1,2,or 3 diamonds, pearls or opals, in 4 colors, red, green, blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; yellow. This deck is shuffled and one removed and hidden; the missing gem for you to discover. The remaining cards are dealt out, any spare are turned up. The other deck is 54 small Search cards, showing one or two elements, eg diamonds, pairs, or blue opals, red pearls, or free choices. Players are dealt 4 each face up. You then select one, ask one player how many they have of that type. So ask for Pairs and the player will say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; if it has the Blue Diamond Pair, the Yellow Pearl Pair and the Green Pearl Pair. But if you ask them for the Red Diamonds, they must pass them over to you to look at in secret, but also declare to the other players how many are being passed.
Players have simple score pads showing the 36 gems on which to record information. Discard the Search card and draw another. You can declare your deduction at any time, or on your turn ask one question without having the Search card and then immediately declare. Mark your sheet, check the missing gem. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re wrong, you keep playing, but only answering questions. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re correct, you win.
The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. It is the mixture of seeing some cards, but only getting told numbers for others, that makes it hard to deduce. Any notation you devise has to be flexible but reliable, and it is as important to record negative information as well as positive detail.

    <notes>German version - Diamentenjagd.
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Please purchase only along with [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/gipyls]two other items I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling[/url], to make the complete Gryphon Games Sid Sackson Signature Collection (Sleuth, Monad, Venture).  Received in a math trade, and never played myself.  Outer box (sleeve that holds all three games) has a bit of shelf wear on the top, but the games themselves look near-perfect.
For US shipping (of all three games), see image below for your zone location, then refer to your zone for shipping pricing:
