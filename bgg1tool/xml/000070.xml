   <description>This game, with its really wonderful plastic bits, is about building a city.  Players acquire cards in eight different 'neighborhoods' and then use them to lay out buildings either one, two, or three spaces large.  The points they receive for a given building is a base score plus bonuses for the buildings surrounding it.  What makes this game really unique is the city hall.  Some player must play it (scoring no points for himself) in order for anyone to start placing any structure beyond the simple residences and business._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the original german Goldsieber version of the game.
Condition rating should be higher as the game has been played only once and everything is in great shape, but unfortunately one small tram piece is missing (should be easily replaced and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play (as you can use an already used one instead...)).
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

This game has been played only twice.  Everything is in excellent condition.  The game had 3 inserts for all of the pieces.  I removed the inserts and no longer have them (they were very annoying).  All of the pieces are bagged.
Cost listed includes shipping. I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex and my discretion. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.

    <notes>Box shows just little wear. Inside everything there in great condition. Also contains the plastic inlays that were given out separately after.
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Box shows little wear. Inside everything there in nice condition. Game has hardly been played.
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

Description: Used, complete. Box has some wear. Components all look great.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande edition. Complete, except for missing plastic insert. Box is clean with only very minor shelf wear. Tiles, cards, buildings all in excellent condition.
Shipping weight 3 lb 8 oz. The awkward Goldsieber box size can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be shipped flat rate, so shipping in the US will depend on your distance from CA and whether you would prefer Parcel Post or Priority Mail. Costs probably range from $8 to $15.</notes>

    <notes>Only played once and has only minor shelf wear.  Original German rules and printed English rules provided.  Extra laminated reference material included.  I have a nice storage container (visible in the picture) but if you want me to include it please add an additional $10 (it was an expensive one).
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the storage container included and add the additional cost to the total.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail.  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  NOTE that the box is a tight fit in the regular USPS Priority Mail flat-rate medium box that I normally use.  I can buy a larger box and figure out the non-flat-rate shipping cost for you.  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal.  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and played, Rio Grande Games edition.  Game is in excellent condition except the box bottom which has a puncture that has been sealed with tape on the inside of the box bottom.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve taken pictures to show you what it looks like.  Anyway, gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain.  Shipping is $7.50.  If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping.  Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>German version, but printout of English rules and some player aids in box.  Box is structurally fine, but has some scuffing and one small liquid spot.  Contents all in good shape and accounted for.  Buildings securely in their inserts.  Will ship to US only for $15.00 due to oversize box.</notes>

I bought this used and played once. All the plastic pieces are there and look excellent. The boards and scoreboard are in excellent condition. I have English rules printed out and they are in the box.  
The box is  structurally sound, but it shows wear and a couple corners are taped on the lid.  Also a few creases.
Also in this listing is the game Eruption, Not in shrink, but never been played. Cards are still in shrink. Everything is in excellent condition.</notes>

    <notes>Components are excellent, like new. Box is also like new. I put down _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; only because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an older game, and in as good a condition as it is, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hard to imagine it feeling new-ish. Also, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve removed the clumsy inserts, which made it very difficult to store and pull out the buildings.
This is the Rio Grande English edition--which matters if you want your city to have neighborhoods and street names that look like it came out of an American city.
Local pickup available in the D.C. area (20815), and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m always happy to provide exact shipping quotes.</notes>

    <notes>It pains me to part with these games, but I was recently in a pretty bad car accident and my vehicle was totaled. I am trying to raise some money to get a new car, public transportation in my area is not very good and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get me to many of the places I need to go.
My copy has never been played, but it does have the teeniest bit of shelf wear along a few of the edges/corners. The cards have been sleeved with FFG clear euro sleeves. Shipping will be $12.</notes>

Good condition: Box has some shelfware/damage. Off course al the board game components are present, but beware that there is no inner boxes. I know some people don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind as the board game components by this game doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really fit in the inner boxes. Anyway I have lowered the price for this copy for it ( I have two copies of condition good, this one has a lower price).
