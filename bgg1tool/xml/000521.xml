   <description>This game is like shuffleboard in the round.  Players take turns flicking disks on a board, trying to score points by attaining central regions.  The main stipulation being that contact with the other teams' pieces must be made in order for the disk to remain on the board afterward.  Although the game uses quite a bit of skill to flick the disks, there's a very significant strategy element to the game.  There are many different variants and rules, as this game is very old and has had many different incarnations over the years._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The board I am selling is professionally made and it will offer top quality play, but it is rather plain looking compared to the decorative boards such as the Hilinski boards, that is why I have it priced lower.

    <notes>Not selling a Crokinole Board, but am selling pure carnauba wax.
I was really nervous to put anything on my board because of the fear that it would mess it up or do the opposite, make it sticky. This works great.  
For 6 dollars I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll mail you a block (a heaping table spoon) to wax your board.
You only use a tiny bit each time so this is probably close to 30-50+ waxes.  You will find that you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to wax it that often for it to retain it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s coat.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve waxed mine twice; I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play it every week but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still pretty slippery. 
(There is a correct amount to use..If you are using a tooth paste squeeze amount you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re using way too much.)
Will send instructions with product.  
Shipping is free.</notes>

Full Description:
Crokinole is one of the top-rated games in the world. For the first time ever Mayday Games is producing a tournament sized Crokinole board for the masses!
Regulation size Crokinole Board. Board measures a substantial 30 1/4 inches across with a 26 inches playing area and 2 inches well around the edges. Middle hole is 1 1/2 inches around and the circle lines drawn at 4 inches, 8 inches and 12 inches out from the center of the board. Board also has installed wire hanging hooks suitable for hanging your game when not in play. (But do so at your own risk!) High-gloss finish on the surface of the board for easy sliding and maintenance. Water tight finish applied to the back to prevent warping from excess humidity or spills. Board made of 0.95 CM MDF base with 0.80 CM MDF top piece. Entire board is topped with a synthetic veneer (not hardwood) which has been lacquered and sealed for a great shine, water-tight finish and quick disc action.
8 wooden pegs (installed on the board). These should probably have been put in the box prior to shipping but were not. If you get a broken peg or two please email us and we will be happy to send you some replacements at no cost.
Screw/Rubber adaptor kit. About 1/2 the crokinole world prefers metal screws surrounded by rubber/latex tubing. Included with your board is an 8-screw and 16inches rubber adaptor kit to allow you to switch to this setup if you so desire!
One 100% beech wood box. Box is for disc storage with built in scoring track (20 holes on top for both players to track their score by 5s to 20)
28 count of 100% Beech Wood discs. 14 natural wood colored and 14 black (you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting two extra of each just in case your kids lose one or two!).
Two scoring markers. These are to be put in the 20 holes on top of the box for easy scoring by fives to 100 points as is standard for the game. Please note these were made slightly larger than the holes on the box. The first time you put them in you need to press them in firmly with your thumb to create a snug fit for your box/discs.
Rule Book. This revised, updated rule book includes all the tournament rules as well as variant suggestions for 3-4 player games as well as care and handling instructions to ensure your board lasts a lifetime! 
Mayday Games are providing a full 1-year warranty from date of purchase. They are so sure you will love this board that they are giving you a full 1-year warranty, a first for a crokinole board of any kind that they know of! Please note major defects/damage due to shipping or apparent manufacturer error must be reported within 30 days of delivery so they can claim the insurance with the shipper/factory. Any problems arising with the board as it is played on are covered for a full year. Anyone who preordered or is buying this current run of product may take advantage of this full 1-year warranty!
This board has great attention to detail and is well crafted to ensure years of fun.
Mayday Games recommend applying a 100% carnauba wax to the surface of the board and the discs for maximum disc speed (not Pledge!).

    <notes>Not selling a Crokinole Board, but am selling pure carnauba wax.
I was really nervous to put anything on my board because of the fear that it would mess it up or do the opposite, make it sticky. This works great. 
For 6 dollars I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll mail you a block (a heaping table spoon) to wax your board.
You only use a tiny bit each time so this is probably close to 30-50+ waxes. You will find that you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to wax it that often for it to retain it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s coat. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve waxed mine twice; I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play it every week but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still pretty slippery. 
(There is a correct amount to use..If you are using a tooth paste squeeze amount you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re using way too much.)
Will send instructions with product.

    <notes>BRAND NEW. Beach colored with a dark cherry surround. 26_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; official size. Comes with a nice wooden box with the pegs and all the discs for play. Very nice for the price. It has a very small flaw on the board mainly seen in the right light situation. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect game play and is mostly superficial. Great color combination. Exact shipping.
