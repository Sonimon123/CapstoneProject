   <description>In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s progress lost._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee - Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t Stop
Language: French (Dutch rules included) 
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 8+
Duration: about 15 min
Weight: 0.250 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In this Sid Sackson classic, there is a board with all the possible results of two six-sided dice: two through twelve. The object of the game is to move a little marker to the top of three columns by rolling that result, but you need many more sevens than you need twelves, based on the likelihood of each result. During your turn, you roll the dice and place temporary markers onto the board. You can continue moving these markers until either none of your dice match (your turn is over and all progress you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve made is gone), or cut your losses and end your turn (placing a permanent marker in your rows). Nice light filler for opening or closing a session.

Parker Brothers
1980
Includes English rules (no French); stop sign board; 11 pieces in each of yellow, blue, orange, green; 3 white pawns; two of four dice - they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re standard dice, easy to replace.
Box is really beat up.  3 out of 4 corners on the lid are split, and one edge is starting to go as well.  Box bottom has its share of dings as well.

    <notes>The same version that Amazon is selling right now. The most recent one. Played a few times. 
Very slight bowing in of top box lid but no dish lines whatsoever. Very hard to see it. Best to get it under a light and look just so to tell. This earns the game a Very Good condition.
Counted and Complete.
Will combine shipping with other purchases.</notes>

Actually, it appears that with three items won, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be due a 15% discount, but since I made the mistake in my spreadsheet I applied a 20% discount anyway.

    <notes>Box is very worn, but no split corners.  Someone has written a large _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the front cover.  The cardboard insert is spotted with age.  However in terms of playing, all the pieces are intact and as-new, except for one blue marker - this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t critical, as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never seen all 11 pieces needed at once.  English rules (only) are included.  A fantastic playing copy of the game.</notes>

    <notes>Product Notes
I would consider this game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; except for a tiny bit of shelf wear on the box. It has been played a half dozen times.
Includes: Bonus Orange _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Black sets of cones (for 5th _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 6th players or just more color choices). {MSRP = $5 per set}
ALSO INCLUDES: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Rollin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Down the Highway_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Expansion! {MSRP = $5.75}
Condition: NEW / Unpunched
SHIPPING: I will ship this via USPS Priority Mail, in a Regional Rate Box (B-2) from Zone 1.</notes>
