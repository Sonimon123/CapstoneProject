   <description>Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;technology tree,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I was on the lookout for this game and ended up getting two excellent copies so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be happy to sell one.
This copy has never been played.  Game is 100% complete and 98% unpunched.
The board is excellent/pristine as one would expect from an unplayed game.
The box is looking kinda crappy but has all its corners intact from what I recall.
The advancement cards haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been seperated yet either.  The following flaw is why I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t rate the game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  The advancement cards have turned over time to an off-white/light tea color with age.
Shipping is up to you but I love Fedex Ground.  They are cheap, not slow, great tracking, and free insurance.

    <notes>This is a good player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of Civilization. I have personally inventoried every component and this game is guaranteed to be complete with the exception of the blank/spare trade cards (which, of course are not necessary for play). This is one of the funnest games ever. The box shows wear in the form of rub marks and age, however there are no split corners. It is intact. The counters, although punched, look new. All counters and cards are sorted and ziplock bagged. S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H to the U.S. is $10. Please inquire about overseas shipping rates. Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>Partly (2/3)-punched copy in nice shape. 
Inventory shows everything is there except 4 missing counters: Egypt, Babylon, Assyria are each missing 1 of 55 tokens with a substitute/blank available if needed and Crete is missing a small marker. Negligible impact on gameplay.
The game comes with mounted boards and might be expensive to ship overseas if you are located outside the U.S. </notes>

I am the original owner of the game and have never played it.  I would have listed the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; were it not for the fact that some of the pieces are punched.

    <notes>*****PLAYER_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8217;S COPY*******
Imagine a game that was played heavily by a bunch of eighth graders and then stuck in a hot attic for 25 years.  That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8217;s this game.
Good news _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8211; It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8217;s complete.  I went and counted all the counters and cards.
Bad news _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8211; Cards have wear and are yellowed.  One card, an ivory, is damaged on its front, another card, an ochre is damaged on its back.  The rule book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8217;s cover has come off, but is present,  and the box has one split corner.
More bad news _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8211; The box and map have some yellow brown spots on them (foxing) and the back of the box clearly has some moisture damage.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8217;s intact, but has some bubbling.
The really bad news _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8211; The African and Babylonian counters are hurting.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8217;ve included pictures of each for your reference.  They are all there, but 34 Africans and 21 Babylonians are taped.  One African is missing his front elephant as are two of the Babylonians.  Each set has one missing city back, but the city front (the important part) is present.
The really good news _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8211; The game INCULDES the expansion trade card set.  So the damaged ochre card can be replaced with one of the originals and there are numerous extra blank trade cards.
This is the early AH version with the one piece map and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8220;architectural_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#8221; box.  Please see the pictures.
This is a great copy of the game for playing as you wont feel bad if someone spills their drink on this copy of this classic game.

    <notes>This is the second edition, only removed from shrink wrap. In fact, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think the components were ever even lifted from the box until I got my hands on it to take inventory.
ALL items are here, just as if you had unwrapped the game yourself. Everything is unpunched and virtually untouched by human hands. All of the extra Avalon Hill pamphlets are here. As I said, everything is exactly as new, bought from the store yourself.
The outer box is also in near-mint condition. There is extremely minor whitening on the corner edges, but otherwise zero damage to anything.
I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t believe I am even selling this. :p

    <notes>This is the second edition, only removed from shrink wrap. In fact, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think the components were ever even lifted from the box until I got my hands on it to take inventory.
ALL items are here, just as if you had unwrapped the game yourself. Everything is unpunched and virtually untouched by human hands. All of the extra Avalon Hill pamphlets are here. As I said, everything is exactly as new, bought from the store yourself.
The outer box is also in near-mint condition. There is extremely minor whitening on the corner edges, but otherwise zero damage to anything.
I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t believe I am even selling this. :p</notes>

    <notes>First edition - verified to be 100% complete. Components are in excellent condition - with six nation counters still unpunched. All paper/cardboard components are straight and crisp with no visible wear or discoloration. Box has some shelfwear and one small tape pull on the end, but is still strong and solid with no dishing or wrinkles. Game is free from offensive odors (smoke, pet, mildew, etc). The first edition Civilization box has a picture of the acropolis and the game board is all one piece with folding panels.  </notes>

    <notes>This is a partial punched copy of this game.  It was played one time with 3 players.  The rest of the nations are un-punched (see pictures).  The box has some shelf marks but other than that looks great. 
Shipping will be $12 and I will pack the game with great care.

    <notes>This is the Gibsons Games edition of the game with a one-piece mapboard (not the horrible 4-piece jigsaw type).
It is very, very similar to the Avalon Hill edition, the rules are virtually identical and the components are basically the same, just the look and feel being different.  I will include a copy of the Avalon Hill rules for reference, so that either edition can be played.
CONDITION: Excellent, near mint - contents barely used and 100% complete, with counters punched, sorted and bagged. The cards are also in ziploc bags.  The box just has light shelfwear.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50
European Postage: £11.50
Rest of World Postage: £23.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.

Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).

    <notes>Avalon Hill 1981 edition. The game is complete. Originally when bought the cards were rubber banded; after the shock I promptly put them in bags. These have never been used and look fairly new, given their age. All of the cards are accounted for as well.
Game was never played (and I never played it either) because none of the counters were punched; in anticipation of playing I punched 2 of the civilizations and bagged them, the rest are still unpunched.
The boards look unplayed and like new as well. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Archeological Succession Card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is present and in like new shape, and the player aids are still attached and like new.
The box has some shelf wear. They taped it shut (!) at some point, and the tape is still there and yellowing. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only 2 pieces and fairly small, but noticeable. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some scuffing and a very small crease on the back, doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even feel like a dent.
Overall, I would normally rate this Very Good due to it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age, but will follow the BGG guidelines!
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If you order several games from me, I will combine shipping.

    <notes>Green and red counters have been punched, but verified complete.  All other 7 sets of counters are unpunched.  All cards verified complete, and includes an extra set of unseparated civilization cards. Gameboard is the thinner, all one piece version.
Box has the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;faces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; artwork and is in good structural condition but has a crease on front and general wear along most edges.
I also have a much more used version, which is missing a few counters and has very well-played components.  I will sell it for $38.  If you want that version instead, send me an offer for that amount and geekmail me to confirm the version.  Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Civilization (1982) from Avalon Hill
Box: Light shelf-wear overall. One corner of the top has been repaired with clear tape and has a dent about 1/4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in from the corner. There is a 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; wrinkle running from one corner of the back toward the middle. Other than these minor issues, the box is in excellent+ condition!
Contents: New, unpunched, mint, and complete! The playing pieces are all unpunched, the Civilization cards are still unseparated, and the board, rules, player mats, and archaelogical Succession card are all new and in mint condition! The trade cards are mint and stored in a plastic bag for safety. ***BONUS*** Also included is a nice, homemade, color photo-copy of the Western Expansion map. The rules for this expansion can be found here on BGG.

There is a small area on the right edge of the top where tape was removed and some staining was left behind. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not sticky - just a dark mark where the tape had been.

I loved this game as a young man, but my current gaming group just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t willing to play.  I have limited space, so some things have to go.
For shipping, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge the shipping cost, plus $2 for anywhere in the continental U.S., and shipping cost plus $4 for elsewhere.</notes>

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE.
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address.
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price).
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 35 cents higher.

    <notes>Avalon Hill, 2nd edition. 
It has been punched and played, but it is complete (I checked every card and counter). All the commodity and advancement cards are in excellent condition. Most of the counters are as well, but a few have minor tears in the paper. The board has a few tiny nicks on the back, along the edges, but the front is excellent. The AST has some mild wrinkles, possibly from slight water damage. The box has very minor shelfwear.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete copy of Civilization, even including the Avalon Hill 1988 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Games and Parts Price List_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. 
Inside the components looks like they were only played with a handful of times, though there is about sticky inch-long line on the back of one of the game boards (can probably be easily removed).
The box top shows more wear and tear, with one corner taped up, some creasing on the sides, and paper tears where the box was once taped shut.</notes>

    <notes>This game was purchased new by me when it was first released.  I have never played it. (We always played with a friends copy.)  The counters were punched and then bagged.
IT ALSO INCLUDES THE EXPANSION TRADE CARDS!!
In addition, all the Civilization cards have been professionally laminated.
The box has a small amount of shelf wear on the bottom and top (see pictures) and there is a small dent on the edge of the  right side, but no other damage.
This is one of my favorite all-time games and I never thought I would sell it, but finances and space have become an issue.  I am also selling my Like New copy of Advanced Civ as well. Check that game listing out as well if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested.
Shipping costs will be exactly what it costs me to ship the item.

    <notes>1982 Avalon Hill edition.
The game has only been played two or three times, and the board, cards and other pieces are in near perfect condition. The box has a fair bit of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;shelf wear_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on it, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all in one piece without any dents, and there are no tears at the corners.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to accept payment in either Canadian or American dollars: whatever is convenient for you.</notes>

The game is 100% complete and all of the components are clean, crisp, and like new. The box shows some shelf wear (mostly on the bottom edge since it has been stored upright like a book), but is otherwise in excellent condition without dents, scratches, or dings.</notes>

The outside of the box is very good with no dings or crushed areas and all the corners are strong with no tears or rips. There is some whitening around the edges and a little on the corners but way better shape then you would think for a game so old. It really is an excellent unpunched copy of the game.
ENJOY!!!</notes>

    <notes>Punched not clipped.  1982 AH version.  Contents are in excellent condition and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this has been played as the Civ cards are all still attached.  Everything is crisp and clean.  The box has one split corner, a couple of minor corner creases and some shelf wear.  If you put your nose to the box you will smell a faint odor of cigarettes - not bad - but you can smell it.  Worldwide shipping and will be packed well. All forms of negotiable instruments considered.  Combine ship with multiple purchases.</notes>

    <notes>Gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy ... heavily played but components are in decent shape. Cards are okay. The two blemishes on my copy are the box (broken corners, definitely worn) and that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve penned in the number _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in black on all value 1 sites (because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hard to read white print on a bright yellow background).
There is also one Illyria unit missing. I still have all of the original blank counters, so the blank can be used to substitute for the missing unit. I seem to recall nobody usually played Illyria and that you only used the full counter set in games with an even or odd number of players. So for a gamer this is probably fine, and for a game collector, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll likely pass. 
My copy also includes the expansion trade cards and some photocopies of some articles.</notes>

    <notes>This is the HARTLAND TREFOIL version of the game, and it comes WITH THE WESTERN MAP EXTENSION (see picture) plus an extra set of German rules!
It has been played once or twice around 25 years ago or so, so condition is great.
Shipping is a bit awkward due to the form of the box.
Within Germany shipping with tracking and insurance will cost 7,00 €.
To everywhere else in the world I can ship the game insured and with tracking for a maximum amount of 21,00 €. However, the actual sum depends on the country I send to and the shipping options.</notes>

    <notes>Das Spiel wurde während meiner Jugendzeit (1990s) viel gespielt. Inzwischen spiele ich es gar nicht mehr, so dass ich es gern weitergeben möchte.
Bei dem Spiel, handelt es sich um die WDS-Version inkl der Westeuropa-Erweiterung, so dass bis zu 10 Spieler gleichzeitig spielen können. Wie man auf den Fotos evtl. sehen kann, sind die Karten nicht eingetütet und weisen somit schon ein paar Gebrauchsspuren auf.</notes>

    <notes>Good condition copy.  Seems to include extra cards - no idea why.
Some shelf wear on the game box.
Extra civilisation cards included in the game (70+ listed in rules, 100+ in the game).
Some _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;perished rubber band_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; residue on the trade cards.
Stain on one of the player mats.
Only two of the player mats have been used - rest are still on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;adhesive pad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Map and rules are in mint condition.
Pieces punched - but game it appears has only been played once.

    <notes>[ NOTE: I am only selling this with the Western Expansion map, see separate listing]
I purchased this game at a game auction back in the 1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, held onto it for over 25 years, and have only played it twice. Sigh.
Condition: box is damaged on the top right corner, and game has seen a lot of shelf wear over the years as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve moved around. All the pieces appear to be present, and I have several printed player aids, and some photocopies of some strategy articles from The General.
I hope this baby finds a good home.</notes>

Box has one corner starting to split, otherwise in good condition.
I have thoroughly checked this copy and there are two components missing, one black token and one Mysticism card, both of which can be easily improvised if needed.

    <notes>Box shows wear, has two split corners which can be easily repaired with glue, and tape on the box bottom.  Board shows some small white spots, I presume from rubbing wear (see photo).  Game pieces were counted and verified 100% complete.  Most of the counters are still unseparated on strips.  It looks like only three colors were ever used.  Trade cards, tech cards, rules and player sheets are in mint condition.  Includes the extra 6 blank trade cards and 1 blank tech card.  The thing that is lowering the condition of this is the game box.  Otherwise the contents are in very good condition.
Will ship in a flat rate box for $10.50.  Will ship internationally.</notes>

Otherwise it is complete-- I counted every card and counter to confirm this.  The box is in good condition with no split corners, but does show wear in several places.</notes>

    <notes>Complete, punched.
I bought and played this game in college in the 80s.
The box is intact, no tears, some shelf wear.
The board is intact and in good condition, but with a couple dog-eared corners.
All cards present, even blank spares.
All counters punched, bagged by color. 
Components are in good shape overall, but the game is definitely used. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for an affordable copy that you can actually play without worrying about messing up a collectible, this is it.
I listed this game as the 1981 first printing edition, because that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what the box cover looks like (with the Parthenon and Egyptian wall painting in panels), but the the back cover says ©1982. BGG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s information must be partially incomplete. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it matters much.</notes>

    <notes>I have this game for quite some time but never got to open it and play due to time constrains. Although the game is sealed you can see in the back (photos) that it seems like the box has some wear underneath the plastic wrap.
I take it that it is just aesthetic damage as the game is unused.</notes>

    <notes>Game is the Avalon Hill 2nd edition in Good condition. *Has never been played*, the player pieces are un-punched, the rulebook doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even look paged through. I have gone through and verified that *all contents are present*. The only game piece condition issue is that one of the civilization cards looks like it was folded at some point (the pottery card in the top left of the photo). The box is in acceptable condition (scuffing on face, corners, back - old tape, a few corners split, but still intact).
Buyer pays $15 shipping, USPS Priority.</notes>
