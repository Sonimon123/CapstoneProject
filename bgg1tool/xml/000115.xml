Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull;    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull;    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull;    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Investor and make it your own._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull;    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull;    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time).

    <notes>Game is very nice, played only a few times and well cared for.
The actual weight might vary slightly after packing; I just give an honest guess, in this case 3 pounds.  I ship via USPS from zip 80015.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing or handling, and will use the lower of Flat Rate ($9.30 now, but it creeps up now and then) or Priority Mail, or Parcel Post if you prefer.

    <notes>This is a quality game by Sid Sackson, published 2004, by Face 2 Face games, is out of print.
Only opened and viewed, never played.  Shortly after I got my copy, played at a friend’s, and it was a raucous party game of negotiation that was a lot of fun, but ordinarily, I am more the orderly negotiator-type, so have decided to let my copy go. 
Box _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; contents are clean, undamaged, complete.

    <notes>There is a little bend on the side of the box, like if heavier games had been on top of this game for quite a while. The box cardboard insert is slightly damaged at one corner. (Along the perforation where the cardboard folds, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s slightly torn.)
The game has been played about 3 or 4 times.

    <notes>Face2Face edition.  
Played a few times -- contents in very good condition.  
Front bottom left box top corner slightly crushed -- not broken or split; it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look that bad; it just looks a little wrinkly in a 1-inch area and rounded-cornered in a 1-centimeter area.
SHIPPING:
   USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS loses or damages the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: If you can provide your email address, you may pay by credit card via Google Checkout.  Or you may pay by PayPal to karlhanf@comcast.net , or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Condition Notes:
Still in shrinkwrap.
(I also have a second copy with a slightly dinged up box that I would sell for $2 less).
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE.
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address.
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price).
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 35 cents higher.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the Boss is a game of deal making and negotiation, where you are an investor just trying to make a deal. Through intelligent negotiations, temporary alliances, and cutthroat bargaining you will rake in millions. But watch out for the other investors at your bargaining table who meddle in your affairs and try to take over your deals. As the boss, you stand to gain the most, but you can find yourself quickly cut out of a deal. In the end, the winner is the investor with the most money. </notes>

    <notes>2004 English (though box says rules also in 5 other languages) Face 2 Face Games edition.
Brand new in shrink.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rip in the shrink on one edge and a maybe 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rip on another edge.
As of this writing this is the only new in shrink copy in the BGG marketplace available domestically.  And from what I can tell the 2010 edition never game out in an English edition (domestic or otherwise).  Also looks like the kick starter 2012 edition got canceled.</notes>

    <notes>Face 2 Face edition. This item comes from a smoke-free, pet-free, adult-only home and has been meticulously cared for.
There is some shelf wear on the box. The game components are in pristine condition, with only normal wear on the cards from being played around a dozen times. The investor cards have been sleeved.
I ship promptly and pack with loving care to ensure the game reaches you in the same condition it was when shipped. Shipping quote upon request. Combined shipping available, please browse my inventory! Local pickup available in Portland, Oregon.
Serious inquiries only, please.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=quicksalelist_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=roamdog
Condition Notes: Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape, but the box top has one blown corner.  
I also have a copy that is still in shrink for a bit more.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Please send a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer) to me.
Alternatively,
Please send an online Amazon gift card to me (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Alternatively,
You can send a Western Union transfer to me.
If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Please send an online Amazon gift card (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me) to me. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Alternatively,
You can send a Western Union transfer to me.
Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that given the recent rate increase by the USPS, the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me unless you literally cannot find it anywhere else. I have no control over these shipping charges.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really accept Paypal payments any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.

    <notes>Great condition played copy of I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the Boss, the English Face 2 Face edition.  Box has some shelf wear.
We played this one maybe 5 or 6 times, but there are two copies in our group, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to reduce down to two shelves.
Buyer prepays plus USPS priority mail shipping.  If I can find a different box, or you order many games, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to combine shipping or make a special trip to the post office for parcel post, but for just a couple games, or a single game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to use the free boxes for priority mail.  
If we can beat flat rate depending upon your location, we will, but many times flat rate does tend to be the least expensive.

    <notes>With a baby on the way, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m clearing out a bunch of games.

I am shipping from 27707 and am happy to combine items for reduced shipping or meet in person. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to entertain any bulk offers, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to send photos or connect over the phone to establish credibility if the lack of feedback is worrisome.
