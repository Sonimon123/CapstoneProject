   <description>Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Type: Industry, Economic 
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 12+
Length: 90-120 minutes
Game Description: 
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone’s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable ’renewable energy’ wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.

Game Description:
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone’s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable ’renewable energy’ wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.

Game Description:
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone’s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable ’renewable energy’ wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.

    <notes>Power Grid (RIO 240)
Type: Economic 
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 12+
Length: 90-120 minutes
Game Description: 
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone’s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable ’renewable energy’ wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.

    <notes>Hi guys, new copy of Power Grid with the Korea/Japan expansion board! All components complete and in pristine condition as if the shrink just came off. The cards are sleeved (I had to trim the cards so I could sleeve them) and the expansion board fits right into the base game box.  I want someone else to enjoy it since its collecting dust in my house, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling them cheap, both together for $25! Hope you fun with this game!

    <notes>Power Grid (RIO 240)
Type: Economic 
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 12+
Length: 90-120 minutes
Game Description: 
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone’s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable ’renewable energy’ wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.</notes>

Type: Economic 
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 12+
Length: 90-120 minutes
Game Description: 
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;renewable energy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 240)
 Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
 The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;renewable energy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes.</notes>

    <notes>Games is overall in good condition.  This one has seen a few years of use, but everything remains perfectly useable and is basically unmarked.  Complete except for one oil barrel that went missing; a black house can easily be substituted in its place.  Otherwise, all components are present.  Power plant cards have some slight wear, but nothing that would render the game unplayable.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO240)
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games,removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence. The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s network gains a predetermined size. Inthis new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities forconnection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants arepurchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;repotentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely bypurchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the rawmaterials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;renewable energy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximumefficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand yournetwork to get the cheapest routes. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO240)
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence. The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;renewable energy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes. </notes>

    The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone’s network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the powerplants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you’re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable ’renewable energy’ wind/solar plants),making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.

Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag.

    <notes>This is for Misterhawk.  Price includes shipping.
Power Grid has been played a bunch but is still in great condition. All the pieces are safely bagged and sorted. The cards are in great shape despite being played so many times. One of the Uranium pieces got munched (in my dogs mouth, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perfectly usable and I painted the the piece back up.) 
Included in this set:
China/Korea Map
Brazil/Spain _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Portugal Map
Flux Generator Promo Card
Theme Park Promo Card
Transformer Station Promo Card
Warehouse Promo Cards
Supply Contract Promo Card
What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, is that I made a bunch of extra things for the game (see picture):
Power Plant Stand
Money Folders
Power Outage Tokens
Power Plant Reference Card
Set-Up Reference Cards
Custom Region Selection Cards</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO240)
Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence. The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants(except for the highly valuable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;renewable energy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.</notes>

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
International orders require insurance which is usually only $2-3 extra to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>Includes Power Grid: The New Power Plant Cards along with the original cards in the deck that came with Power Grid. The new cards emphasize renewable energies more. Excellent shape, never used. Kept in smoke-free, pet-free house. English version marked _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;completely new edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on box by Rio Grande but I have no idea what year this edition is.
Shipping will be $18.75 because it only fits in the game board box style of priority mail large flat rate box.</notes>
