   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Mice and Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra's minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Collin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle's former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra's weakness and defeat her._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mice and Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle's housecat, Brodie. Mice and Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mice and Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; assuming they can all squeak by..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expansion advice:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For those who have expansions for this game the recommended order by the game designer for playing them is as follows (see original post HERE):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Sorrow and Remembrance (Base game)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Cat's Cradle (Lost Chapter 1)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Heart of Glorm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        The Ghost of Castle Andon (Lost Chapter 2)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Downwood Tales_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        Portents of Importance (Lost Chapter 3), connected to the story in Tail Feathers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Adventure Awaits! Living in the walls Lurk things that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t nice, That nobody knows of Except for the mice. In Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king - but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Colin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weakness and defeat her. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s housecat, Brodie. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to horde the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come. Assuming they can all squeak by... </notes>

Adventure Awaits! Living in the walls Lurk things that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t nice, That nobody knows of Except for the mice. In Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king - but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Colin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weakness and defeat her. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s housecat, Brodie.

The Cheese System allows players to horde the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.

    <notes>Base game. Very minor wear and tear on some cards (extremely minor scuffing on some corners of some cards) nothing that will impact game play. Components in this game are delicate. recommend sleeving cards. Very minor mashing of some tile corners on some tiles (this is due to the way the game was manufactured and not due to poor handling of the game). Fairly unnoticeable and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect game play.
Other than the above issues the game has been babied and well taken care of. There is no damage. The game is clean and organized. figures are unpainted. Has not been handled by children and has not been exposed to smoking. The game appears almost new.

    <notes>Game is in like-new condition, as it has only been played one time.  
Bonus: 1) All the standard-sized cards are in FFG sleeves (the small cards are not in sleeves).
Bonus: 2) Extras:  Comes with promo cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Needle Rapier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tattered Threads of Reason._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Bonus: 3) I have the set of storybook mp3s for the game (they narrate all the storybook sections).  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to burn a CD of those and send them along, since I obviously won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them anymore!
Bonus: 4) ALL FIGURES HAVE BEEN CUSTOM PAINTED and the game comes with a second set of rats (including a Captain Vurst figure), a second centipede (for the boss), and a second _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;spider_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (for the boss).
 - The heroes are incredibly detailed
 - Instead of 6 rats, you get 12: 6 regular rats, 5 elite rats, and 1 Captain Vurst (with a cape!)
 - There is an extra centipede and an extra _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;spider_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; for the boss figures (but note I had the spiders morphed into beetles; see pic below).

    <notes>Very lightly played  - three games total.  All components present and pristine. 
A great game to play with family or non-gamers, but a bit too simple for the hard core gamers.  An elegant rule-set, and game play is smooth, even better than Descent in many respects.

Adventure Awaits! Living in the walls Lurk things that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t nice, That nobody knows of Except for the mice. In Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king - but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Colin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weakness and defeat her. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s housecat, Brodie. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to horde the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come. Assuming they can all squeak by... </notes>

The one time I played, I used the deck with the damaged card, so you will be getting an extra sealed deck included.</notes>

Mice and Mystics + HoG expansion 
Game in great condition, only played the first two missions once. 
*** All cards are sleeved and are included in the game *** 
(for reference, if you wanted to sleeve the expansion using the same sleeves, I used Mayday green for the large cards -which are say 1mm too short but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fine- and Mayday mini euro for the small ones)
*** Also include an extra set of 5 action dice that I had ordered straight from Plaid Hat - sold out for a while now! ***
+ HoG expansion; opened but unplayed.
Postage to UK only for both base game and expansion: £6

    <notes>Plaid Hat Games (PLDMM01)
 Adventure Awaits! Living in the walls Lurk things that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t nice, That nobody knows of Except for the mice. In Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king - but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Colin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weakness and defeat her. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s housecat, Brodie. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to horde the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come. Assuming they can all squeak by... </notes>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition - played a handful of times carefully, cards have always been sleeved and miniatures have been highlighted with paint.   Not completely painted but very nicely highlighted.  
Payment via PayPal, or cash for local pickup.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of GMT war games and other classic boardgames. </notes>

    <notes>Plaid Hat Games (PLDMM01)
Adventure Awaits! Living in the walls Lurk things that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t nice, That nobody knows of Except for the mice. In Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king - but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Colin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weakness and defeat her. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s housecat, Brodie. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to horde the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Mice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come. Assuming they can all squeak by...</notes>

    <notes>Crumbles Figure
Looked high and low for a Crumbles figurine for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;lost chapter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in this wonderful game...but couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find one. Contacted the designer to ask if Plaid Hat Games was going to produce a figure...and was told they weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t. So I finally found a game with some little mice that would work. They are not as detailed as the mice that come with the game...but once I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d cut them off their base, glued them on a  tiddly wink...and painted them...they came up alright.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included Nez in the picture just to give you an idea of the size. FIGURE COMES PAINTED AS SEEN.</notes>

    <notes>Campaign has been played through 1 time, so there is normal wear and tear (nothing excessive - no bent or broken items, but some cards/boards may be slightly scuffed from normal play). Includes a Plano organizer for all the bits as well as self-printed/folded/glued card boxes and character envelopes (these are GREAT time savers). Game comes from a smoke-free home.
Shipping to US is $14. Combine with my Mice and Mystics: Downwood Tales offering (http://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/954297) for savings on shipping (if you purchase both at the same time, I will ship them together for $19).</notes>

    <notes>I am an experienced miniatures painter and I painted the miniatures for game-play and at a relatively high (above board game) quality.  For example, the roaches are painted like scarab beetles and the rats are each a different color so that they are easily distinguishable during play.  I noticed that I have not finished the centipede, so I can ship as is or customize it for you.
Shipping:
Most games can fit in a USPS medium flat rate box, which will ship in 1-3 business days for $13. Otherwise, games are being shipped from 80906.  
I am selling most of my collection, so check out the rest of my games in the market to save significantly on shipping!</notes>

    <notes>Box and components are in perfect condition.  Outer shrink is removed, cardboard chits have been cut from their trees with a hobby knife so there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no tearout, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never had a chance to play it.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very OCD with my game collection so keep my games in as-close-to-perfect order as possible.  The photos make it look like the edges of big boards are rough, but this is just glare off the shiny paper at the edge, the edges are all normal.
I pack games in a sturdy cardboard box with a lot of bubble wrap.  Shipping is approximately $20 by Australia Post, please message me for a more accurate quote.
I have a few co-ops for sale if that is your thing, my group doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like them so they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get played.
Thanks for looking, if you have any questions just let me know.</notes>

In excellent condition with only very, very slight wear on box, and almost no wear at all (if any) on components. Complete with all components, and components are sorted into baggies, with certain items set aside in a separate baggie as per the instructions for first-time play. 
The only flaw is that one corner edge of the bottom box is torn.</notes>

    <notes>Includes painted figures. Played several times by my family (finally beat it), but it is still in very good condition. The only visible sign of wear is white on the corners of the rule books and some of the cards - very slight. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got kids around age 5-10, this is the perfect game to play as a family. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a great lightweight dungeon crawl that keeps giving you a reason to come back to it. Plus painted minis! Painted to match the color scheme on cards. It really helps with the immersion. My daughter loved being Tilda - every time she rolled the dice to attack, she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d yell, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tilda, Smash!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Hopefully your family will enjoy this game as much as mine did.</notes>

    <notes>All components present. Some water damage to parts (viewable in the photos). No impact to playability. Of particular note:
* The Maginos character card, both front and back.
* Very slight water damage to the story control board. Not much visible from the front, but some visible on the back (pictures taken with and without flash).
Shipping via USPS Priority Large, so $18.90 (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund the difference if I can fit it into Medium at $13.65). If you really want, I can figure out how much it would cost for UPS/FedEx Ground, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take some more time to do.</notes>

    <notes>Painted.  Some shelfwear around the edges and corners of the box.  In the right light, you can see where someone rested their glass on the cover (I got this game in a trade).  The game boards as well as some cards have white markings around the edges.
Depending on where you live shipping costs $7-12.  Feel free to ask for the exact cost.  Games get mailed USPS Priority and typically go out the business day after payment is received.</notes>
