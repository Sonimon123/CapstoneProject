    <notes>This game is in excellent condition and has never been played. Shrink is removed from box but the contents are unpunched/untouched.
I prefer paypal payments but will also accept money orders.
This game will ship either USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion.
This game is an odd shape and is pretty heavy so shipping will be $15.00 with the increase in shipping costs this month.</notes>

Payment: I accept PayPal, money orders, personal and cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks. Personal checks will be accepted but I will wait until the check has cleared before sending the item. I will add 3.9% to the price when paying by PayPal.
Return Policy: I want you to be completely satisfied with your item. Because of this, I will accept return of any item for a refund of the purchase price within 30 days of the sale. The item must be in the same condition that it was sent. I cannot refund the shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>Academy Games (AYG 5002)
Storms of Steel witnesses histories greatest tank battle. After the stinging defeat at Stalingrad, the Germans gather their best forces for an all out attack to smash through the Soviet lines. The Soviets, having learned of the German_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s plan through their spy networks, prepare a trap to stop and then decimate Germany_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best Panzer forces. 
All new units including Tiger tanks, Soviet rockets, strafing airplanes, Soviet Red Guards, and much more!
4 huge new map boards!
All new firefights, including detailed historical backgrounds.
Storms of Steel continues the groundbreaking game concepts introduced in Awakening the Bear with new highly integrated airplane and anti-air rules. Stukas dive bomb, Sturmoviks strafe, and FlaKpanzer Wirbelwinds desperately try to fend off the death from above.

    <notes>Counters punched and sorted into poly bags. Board, counters and cards near mint condition. Played only a few times. No wear at all. Box perfect. Rule book has a small handful of important rules neatly highlighted in yellow highlighter. Otherwise, no wear on rule book. 
Due to shipping costs, I will only ship via Canada Post to locations in Canada (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a heavy game and postage would be too high otherwise). Buyer pays postage costs.</notes>

    <notes>Storms of Steel!  makes you a witness to the greatest tank battle in history! After their stinging defeat at Stalingrad, the Germans mass their best forces for an all-out attack against the growing Soviet bulge at Kursk. The Soviets’ network of master spies has caught wind of the German plans, and they are prepared to trap and decimate the best panzer forces the Germans can muster...
Storms of Steel! is the second stand-alone title in the best selling Conflict of Heroes series and follows in the footsteps of Awakening the Bear! by winning the 2010 Origins Award for Best Historical Board game. Each game in the series uses the same core rules system, so it’s easy to advance from one game to the next!
Bought this game and played it a couple of times...not really my cup of tea.
Will ship world wide so please contact for a postage quote.
Cheers

AND its cheap.  Nice box with no busted corners and little wear.  Worldwide shipping and will be packed well.  All forms of negotiable instruments considered even Facebook stock.  Combine ship on multiple buys but buyer beware - this is a heavy one!!</notes>

    <notes>Hello, this Game is in shrink (one corner of the shrink opened for the sign) signed by Uwe Eickert.
I will ship Worldwide, but it maybe pricey outside Europe.
Feel free to ask for shipping costs.

    <notes>Lot: Storms of Steel, Awakening the Bear, Price of Honour
Played only a couple of the intro scenarios for SoS, everything else is unused. 
Have most, if not all, original content from AtB (old cards, counters). All current counters are organized in GMT counter trays, and all current cards sleeved (original stuff is just bagged). Comes with some laminated sniper sheets and a few play aids, although I think they are mostly outdated. 
This will ship in the SoS and PoH boxes. I do have the AtB box but it is more beat up than the other two. Can be included at additional expense. 
I picked _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as the condition because it fits the description, but this is leaning toward _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; where most of the stuff has not even been used.

    <notes>Parts and boards are like new. It was a ding-and-dent purchase that I had to make some repairs on. Two corners were split, which I repaired with cardboard reinforcements (the bottom reinforcement may need to be redone in the future owing to the weight of the components). There is also some warpage/bowing on the sides of the box owing to it being left on the bottom of the stack at the warehouse (see photos). After repairs, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d say the box is in solidly _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition--the cover photo below is taken from the boxes worst side. I will send you more pictures and/or details if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.
I will entertain offers. :)
I will charge exact shipping from 80004 via USPS or your preferred shipper. The box is too big for the flat rate boxes so the price will probably be a little higher, $15 or so, but I will get you an exact price ahead of time. 
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Like new but without the shrink, the cards inside are still in shrink.
I will ship internationally too!
All my items I sell are either New in Shrink, or Like New. I take care of my games period, that includes inside and out. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m OCD about it. If for some reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a game that isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t New or Like New it will be noted. 
Thanks for looking, keep gaming.</notes>

Also includes all the original Awakening the Bear Maps(#1-5) in like new condition also, the Marsh map(#6), an extra counter sheet(punched) for extra Road block, Hasty Defense, Gun Pit, Trench, etc., counters, the cards are sleeved and in a plastic Deck Box and the two player Track Sheets are laminated.  All the counters are in GMT counter trays(3).  The Rule and Scenario books look like new because I downloaded and printed out a copy of each and didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use them at all.  It will be hard to find a copy this game with all the extras I am including. </notes>

    <notes>This is for Conflict of Heroes: Storm of Steel.
The game has been opened and gently played with, but all components are still present and in great shape.  The box and all components would easily rate either Very Good or Like New.  All components are present and already pre-sorted into labeled baggies (i.e. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Russian Infantry_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;German Tanks_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, etc.).
Buyer will pay for shipping, probably either USPS Parcel Select or UPS Ground, I can give quotes for both and ship whichever is preferred.
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see pictures.  Also be aware I have a whole series bundle available if you are interested in that, with Awakening the Bear, Storm of Steel, Price of Honour, and the Marsh Expansion Map all together.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking 124.99 for the lot if you are interested.  Thanks.</notes>

=================
Punched and bagged.  Looks unplayed, but might have been played once - there is a punchout board of terrain tiles which is unpunched (perhaps not needed for the scenario played).  The contents are like new (one of the four player guide has a tiny bend at  one corner).  The box has a tiny bit of wear on one corner, the paper is coming up just a little on another and one short edge of the lid bows out from the base a little.
I will ship this anywhere in the world, but this will be expensive to ship outside of the U.S.</notes>

    <notes>The game is no longer in shrinkwrap.  The game is unplayed and essentially unpunched.  A few of the counters may have been punched at one point in time.  Not sure.
All 75 cards are present.  The card deck has been opened.  All rules, firefights, player aids, maps and terrain overlays are present.  Both dice are present along with the original small insert.
The rules and firefight book have been looked through at least once.
Game box is still in very good shape.  However, the box top is displaying a bit of flaring along all four sides.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most pronounced along the long sides of the box top.  However, the box top stated flaring the second it was removed from shrinkwrap!
Game comes from non-smoking house.
Please send GeekMail if you wish to add a copy of the Map Board #6 - The Marsh as part of a combined purchase.  I believe I have an extra Marsh board or two from past trades.</notes>

    <notes>Ich verkaufe hier die deutsche Version von dem Brettspiel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Angriff! Teil 2: Ostfront 1943 - Kursk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Umzugsbedingt muss ich meine Sammlung verkleinern und mich schweren Herzens von diesem hervorragendem Taktikspiel trennen. Ich habe die Counter/Spielmaterialien durchgeschaut und konnte keine fehlenden Elementen bemerken. Die Einheiten habe ich in Kunstoffboxen gepackt, damit sie sich besser sortieren lassen und geschützt sind. Die Karten, Würfel und Spielchips sind in gutem Zustand, der Karton hat an den Ecken leichte Gebrauchsspuren (wie auf den Fotos zu erkennen).

    <notes>Note that this comes in 2 (two) boxes so is very heavy. I would prefer to sell locally and have it picked up but will post at your expense.
Game has been played quite a lot but is in great condition. One of the boxes shows slight creasing from the original delivery. The second box was a replacement but has proved useful for storage.
There is a duplicate set of rules that I printed out and bound.</notes>

    <notes>I know it says +shipping, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering Free shipping to the lower 48 states.  Ignore the +shipping in the listing.  I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t figure out how to turn that off.
I played the introductory scenario one time and only punched the counters needed for that.  It is basically unplayed.  The majority of the bits are unpunched.  It really is a fantastic game that I just can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to the table.  The box doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even show noticeable shelf wear as it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t one that got moved around much.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m 40-something and anal about games. Included is what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the picture. Please GM me with any questions.  Happy to provide a shipping quote, just send me your zip code.</notes>

Within Euro-zone I do prefer payment via EU-standard-bank-transfer (SEPA, IBAN/BIC) because it has no fees and is quick and safe.
If you want to pay via PAYPAL this will normally be OK, too, but please contact me upfront and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to take over all PAYPAL fees.

    <notes>Includes the Marsh expansion. Russian and German unit pieces are in a counter tray. The other pieces will be bagged. Only played about a dozen times. Cards were played in sleeves. In near perfect shape other than a little shelf wear on the box. 
I have also included a copy of the additional firefights released for SoS printed by me. The game can be upgraded to the 3rd edition with files from Academy Games and with the purchase of the custom d12 from them when available.
$35 plus shipping.</notes>
