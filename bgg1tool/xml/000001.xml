   <description>Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This one is a nice collectors item. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the quite rare 1st edition of the game which had only a small print run. Everything there in mint/unpunched condition. 
I only rated it very good because it has a very small scratch on the bottom of the box.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.30€ worldwide and 8.20€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.</notes>

For costumers in the USA and Canada the shipping of games can be arranged with United States Postal Services (games up to 1 lb. and only within the USA) or Fedex Ground (most of the USA and Canada). 
There is a small handling surcharge due to the higher effort of this special shipping offer. But believe me, the shipping costs and the delivery time (apx. 2 to 5 business days within the USA or 4 to 8 business days for shipments to Canada) probably will convince you.
If you need more details please e-mail me your ZIP or Postal code and I will reply as soon as possible with an irresistible (???) offer.

I opened the box and punched but never played. Components are absolutely nice and clean. Like a new condition. However,two corners of the box are little bit dent during shipping(it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very small),as you can see the photos.  I even printed the thick rules. The rule is included. 
 
Ground shippig. $14 for US, $12 for Canada. Insurance Included. For elsewhere, pls let me know your address.

The box bottom has one corner, which is beginning to split. Components are punched, but in perfect condition. Pictures available upon request.

    <notes>The beloved game of political scheming and dealing for power in Germany. 
This is the recent English-language reprint from Valley Games. This game is never opened, still in shrinkwrap, complete with all original materials in brand-new condition. A great addition to any true gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s collection.
This game has been adult-owned in a smoke-free, child-free, pet-free household. Again, brand-new.

    <notes>*** Brand new in shrinkwrap, but the box got banged on one corner, making a 1-inch area crumpled but not really broken.  It should still open and close fine. ***
SHIPPING:
USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping! So look at my other games for sale. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game.
MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance. (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.
Thank you! I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>Valley Games Edition. Practically like new. Played once. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just too hard to get a group together to play where I live, but it is a great game. 
I will ship within 2-3 business days of receiving payment. Shipping will be via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation. I estimate shipping and packaging material costs at $14.99. If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s higher, I will pay the difference. 
I have 100% positive feedback on EBay, but am new to selling on BGG. Buy with confidence. Please contact me with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games version.  Complete and in like-new condition; box is open, but counters are not punched.
You pay all shipping charges. For domestic shipping, this game can be shipped inside a medium Priority Mail flat rate box for $11.00.This method also does not include insurance, which can be added for $1.75. I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged shipments if you do not purchase insurance.
Please note that the Priority Mail flat rate box does not allow for much padding, so if you are concerned about damage during shipment you may want to have it shipped by another method. I will ship by any carrier you prefer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping for multiple items. I have quite a few games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling, but it is taking me a while to list them, so e-mail me for a complete list. Use zip code 98104 to calculate shipping costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to arrange for local pickup in the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia area.
I will ship anywhere, by your choice of carrier, however there is a $10 surcharge per international shipments above the cost of shipping to compensate me for the additional time involved in shipping internationally. Note that this is per shipment, so if you buy several games from me and have them shipped together, you just pay once. Sorry to have to do this, but international shipments are much more time consuming for me than domestic shipments.
Payment by PayPall only, except for local pickup which must be paid in cash. Sorry, no checks or money orders.  I will ship within 3 days of receipt of payment.

    <notes>HiG version of the game, never played. The box has some decent dents on the bottom and the box has a 1 inch or so split on the bottom back, but otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quite sound. The contents are in near mint shape, with only some of the chits having popped out of the cardboard tree. 
I ship via USPS (my zip is 95618), and ask that if you pay via PayPal you add 2% to the total cost. Let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

Valley Games edition, punched but unplayed
The counters, boards, tokens, cards, score pads, CD, and insert are all in excellent condition. The rulebook is in very good condition -- It has clearly been read, but it is clean and the pages are unbent. The box is likewise in very good condition.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. (Die Macher does fit in a medium sized flat rate box, so that should be at most $10.50 in the US.) I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition - the only _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wear_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is that the box top and some sides have faded (sunlight?).  All the components are present and correct and in excellent condition. This is the widely admired Hans im Glück first edition (blue box). Obviously a german version, but I include full english translation (not too easy to find for this version!).  And some player aids, suggested improvements etc.

Description: Die Macher from Valley Games in mint/sealed condition. Box has minor compression ding in the upper right corner
 
Shipping Weight: 5 lbs
 
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
 
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition. I have modified the game to have an American political theme. I have used printed sticky paper to change the parties to Republican, Democrat, Green, Independence, and Libertarian.  I have changed the German states to American states, both on the tiles and the cards, using professional looking state outlines.  I matched up the total seats with an equivalent electoral college amount. Definitely improves the playing experience for American players. All gameplay and mechanics are the same as the original game.

    <notes>Game played only once. All pieces are there. Everything is in very good condition, except a couple of player cards have what appear to be very tiny factory made blemishes -- these were not the result of the one play. But I therefore have downgraded the condition to acceptable and dropped the price accordingly.

    <notes>HANS IM GLUCK German 2nd edition. Best edition of the game IMO. I sold my other two editions and have been hanging onto this one. Time now to let this one go as well. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Imported By: Rio Grande Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; sticker on the cover. English rules are included, along with numerous play aids.
Played a couple of times. Components still look new. Box has a little shelf wear. One ding to the upper left corner of the box. Not too bad. The corner was not split.
Shipping charges paid by the buyer. Combined shipping  available. Please let me know if you wish for the shipment to be insured.</notes>

    <notes>Terrific condition, cards look absolutely stone mint.
I selected Like New because of the overall impression, but do want to note that there are some very neatly written, accurate clarifications written into the rulebook. These are NOT the ravings of a madman, these are things you will immediately be glad to have in there, especially in handwriting so much better than yours probably is.
There are also a slew of high-quality, FULL-COLOR player-aid print-outs included, as well as some really nicely done paperboard tuck boxes for many of the card decks, each printed with the cover art.</notes>

    <notes>German second edition, removed from shrink and punched, never played, everything is in excellent condition.
1770 g =_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; could be shipped in a 2kg parcel, though not with perfect packaging, so better let me use a heavier parcel. As a 5kg parcel can get expensive for international shipping (see below), I could also split the game and ship some heavy wooden components in a letter (e.g. Großbrief) and the rest in a well packed 2kg parcel.
(Within Germany, I recommend using a Hermes parcel S (or M) rather than a DHL Päckchen because the weight is irrelevant for Hermes.)
Does fit in a 30 cm wide parcel.
If you have any questions or want to discuss a shipping solution, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to contact me via GeekMail.</notes>
