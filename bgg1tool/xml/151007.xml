    <notes>Selling the base game plus the Character add-on deck, plus all six expansion decks.
Cards were always played sleeved, so condition is near mint.
Some cards very slightly warped, but can be easily flattened out and if sleeved this would not show.
Would prefer shipping to the United Kingdom, but will gladly ship elsewhere (buyer to pay actual shipping costs).
Would prefer a bank transfer instead of PayPal.
Any questions, please ask.
And please check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (Skull and Shackles), and Lord of the Rings: The Card Game (all six packs from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, Khazad-dûm (deluxe expansion), Heirs of Númenor (deluxe expansion), Over Hill and Under Hill (saga expansion), On the Doorstep (saga expansion)).</notes>

    <notes>This sale is for the base set plus all six adventure expansions in this series, only two of which have been opened.  Very lightly played; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very careful in how I treat my games, and especially my cards.  I have 4 x packs of FFG colored sleeves, a different one for each character.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sleeve every card, but I sleeve whatever is currently in each character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s deck.  These sleeves will be included too.   I did not buy the character expansion pack; you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to get that on your own.</notes>

    <notes>This item is reserved for user runescience. 
Includes Character add-on, and adventure packs 2-6. Also includes a Seltyiel miniature. The basic blue dice have been replaced with a slightly fancier set. 
The box shows minor shelfwear. The cards have been played up through box 3, so some have minor nicks that you would expect from normal play. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t consider any of them to be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;marked_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but if you are super picky, you might. I opened and inventoried all the expansions, and had Paizo send me some replacements for several missing and damaged cards. 
This is a large, heavy game, so expect to pay at least $15 shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping. If you see anything on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; list that isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t in the marketplace, make me an offer and if we agree on terms, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll create a marketplace item for that as well.</notes>

    <notes>Complete set: All Scenarios + Character Add-on Deck
Scenarios 2-6 are unopened and the cards are still in shrink. Some of the character and fleet cards have light pencil marks, these erase easily as I had replayability in mind when I made the marks (they are for tracking powers/feats). There was a tear down the corner of the box during shipping, I clear taped it and I honestly could not tell you which side had the tear, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not noticeable.
Please PM to discuss shipping cost, should be $10-20 for US addresses. I ship AT COST, I do not mark up shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base set, the Wormwood Mutiny expansion, the character add-on deck, 4 skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; shackles add-on deck mats and 7 skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; shackles base set character mats.  I removed the shrinkwrap from the base game so that I could include everything in the box, but all of the cards are still factory sealed and the game has never been played.  Comes from a smoke-free home.
     Added 8/21/16 - good news/bad news :)   I just realized that I also have the 24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Ultra Pro gaming playmat for Pathfinder.  Unfortunately, it will add to the shipping cost because of the size of the box that holds the playmat.</notes>

What you get:
The base set, the add-on character pack, and the six adventure packs (each one with its promo card)!
About the condition: the big box is okay; it was not pristine to begin with anyway. The seven packs are opened but present. The cards were not sleeved. The campaign was played once (45 plays for 35 scenarios) by component-loving adults, in a smoke-free, kid-free, food-on-the-table-free environment. All the cards are accounted for, and sorted back in their packs, so the campaign can be started with no fuss.

    <notes>This comes with the Goblin Keelhaulin promo, Character add-on for 5-6 players, and Adventure Decks 2-4. Adventure deck 4 is still unopened. The only reason we stopped playing is because we moved half way across the country. Rather than replay half the campaign, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re going to move to a different campaign based board game with friends.</notes>

Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 6.5 pounds, and will not fit into a USPS Flat Rate Box so figure an extra pound or two of packing material.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:
