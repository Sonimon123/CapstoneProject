   <description>In Hostage Negotiator, you play the part of a law enforcement agent responsible for negotiating the release of hostages taken by an unscrupulous figure hell-bent on having his or her demands met._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn in the game represents a conversation between you and the hostage taker. You'll play cards and roll dice to increase conversation points, decrease the threat level, and release hostages. Hostage Negotiator uses a unique _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;hand-building_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mechanism that puts cards you purchase directly in your hand for next turn rather than leaving you wondering when the cards will show up like in deck-building games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Hostage Negotiator there are multiple paths to victory, but the hostage taker has other plans. Will you try to calm him and get him to surrender? Will you stall and bide your time before sending in the team for a major extraction? How many hostages will you save? These are many of the exciting decisions you will make in a game of Hostage Negotiator!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Check out my other games to bundle an order and save on postage. I usually get the package in the post the day after purchase. I must emphasise that I take extra care to package in a sturdy box with packing protection, however I accept no responsibility for the package once it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the hands of Auspost. If you have a wild postal contractor who likes to hurl boxes AFL style at your front door then please let me know to organise signature on delivery. (Likewise if you live in a building where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not prepared to take the risk of Auspost leaving a parcel at the front door.) No refunds for damage or loss in transit - please take it up with Auspost - I will be happy to provide a copy of the receipt for your claim. All parcels come with a tracking number. If you require extra insurance then let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll arrange it. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold hundreds of games using Auspost and only once had a problem with damage to a game.
Local pickup in St Ives is available.</notes>

    <notes>Played only once or twice. Really nice components and pretty good game, but unfortunately a solo-game is not for me.
This also included the KS rewards and Abductor Packs #1 and #2.
I do not use PayPal, after being scammed a couple of times. I will allow payment through PayPal as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;sending money to friend/family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Otherwise, bank transfer would be my preffered choice or cash, with local pick-up.
Contact me before making a purchase, if you wanna know the shipping costs.
Verzenden in NL kan met Kiala, DHL of TNT. Afhalen kan in Dordrecht, Rotterdam en Rijswijk op afspraak.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through GM.</notes>

    <notes>Van Ryder Games (VRG003)
In Hostage Negotiator you play the part of a law enforcement agent responsible for negotiating the release of hostages taken by an unscrupulous figure hell bent on having his or her demands met. Each turn in the game represents a conversation between you and the Hostage Taker. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll play cards and roll dice to increase Conversation points, decrease the Threat level, and release hostages. Hostage Negotiator uses a unique _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hand-Building_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mechanic that puts cards you purchase directly in your hand for next turn rather than leaving you wondering when the cards will show up like in deck building games. In Hostage Negotiator there are multiple paths to victory, but the Hostage taker has other plans. Will you try to calm him and get him to surrender? Will you stall and bide your time before sending in the team for a Major Extraction? How many hostages will you save? These are many of the exciting decisions you will make in a game of Hostage Negotiator!</notes>

    <notes>This package includes the main Hostage Negotiator game PLUS Abductor Packs 1,2,3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 4 for £28
This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much. All of the game components (cards, dice, meeples, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game twice but always with care, on a green baize cloth. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.
I am selling the main game with Abductor Packs #1, #2, #3 and #4 and charging £3.50 each.
So the whole package will cost £14 + (4 x £3.50) = £28 plus shipping.
NOTE: This game has a custom insert (see picture)! This allows all 4 Abductor Packs to be stored in the main box and leaves room for storing further expansions. The insert is made of sturdy blue card with card lifts to ease the task of removing cards.
