   <description>Timeline: Diversity is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Themes included in Timeline: Diversity are: Discoveries, Arts, Events, Music, Inventions, Monuments, and Sports._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Timeline: Diversity can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series (except Timeline: Star Wars)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Timeline: Discoveries_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Timeline: Events_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Timeline: Inventions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Timeline: Music _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cinema_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Timeline: American History_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Timeline: Americana_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Time is what prevents everything from happening at once._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ... but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make Timeline any easier! The invention of the tank, the 1st appearance of a Superhero, and the invention of the coffee maker... Can you put all these events correctly on the timeline? With Timeline, learn the answer to this question and thousands more. Each card has a different historical event and on the opposite side its associated date. To begin, one card is randomly selected from the draw pile. This is placed in the middle of the table, date-side up and is the starting point of a chronological line which will slowly be built by players. The first player then chooses one of their cards and places it before or after that of the initial card. The player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card is then turned date-side up. If the player was right, it remains on the table. Otherwise, the card is discarded and a new one must be drawn to replace it. The more cards which are correctly played, the harder it is to correctly place new ones! The first player to get rid of their cards wins. </notes>

Time is what prevents everything from happening at once._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ... but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make Timeline any easier! The invention of the tank, the 1st appearance of a Superhero, and the invention of the coffee maker... Can you put all these events correctly on the timeline? With Timeline, learn the answer to this question and thousands more. Each card has a different historical event and on the opposite side its associated date. To begin, one card is randomly selected from the draw pile. This is placed in the middle of the table, date-side up and is the starting point of a chronological line which will slowly be built by players. The first player then chooses one of their cards and places it before or after that of the initial card. The player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card is then turned date-side up. If the player was right, it remains on the table. Otherwise, the card is discarded and a new one must be drawn to replace it. The more cards which are correctly played, the harder it is to correctly place new ones! The first player to get rid of their cards wins. </notes>
