   <description>Northwest India at the beginning of the 18th century. The rule of the Grand Moguls is waning, and the Maharishis and princes seize the opportunity to take control of the region. By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is #3 in the Alea big box series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Alea (German) edition -- brand new in shrinkwrap, but with some damage to the box (no expected damage to the game contents inside).  
Box bottom has a small (fingertip) sized dent with a 1/4 inch tear in the center, and some light creases about 2 inches long through this dent.  Box top has been cut, about 10 inches total, not all the way through the cardboard, but through the artwork so that it is clearly noticeable.  Will send a photo on request.
Priced to sell, so this is a good opportunity to get this out-of-print game, with unused, undamaged game components, at a low price.
Contact me with questions.

Shipping is EUR 8.20 within Europe or $14.40 worldwide. 
The delivery time varies from 1 to 5 weeks.
I can offer even more games upon request.
Please also check listings of my friend montsegur - combined regular shipping is possible.
For more details on my USA and Canada special shipping offer please click robbirob and then the more info button.
For costumers in the USA and Canada the shipping of games can be arranged with United States Postal Services (games up to 1 lb. and only within the USA) or Fedex Ground (most of the USA and Canada). 
There is a small handling surcharge due to the higher effort of this special shipping offer. But believe me, the shipping costs and the delivery time (apx. 2 to 5 business days within the USA or 4 to 8 business days for shipments to Canada) probably will convince you.
If you need more details please e-mail me your ZIP or Postal code and I will reply as soon as possible with an irresistible (???) offer.

    <notes>This is the German version of the game.  All components are present and in great condition.  The box is sturdy with no split corners; however, an E-Bay seller attached a mailing label directly to the box front.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve removed it, but small remnants of the label remain.  So the box front is in a sort of ding-n-dent condition.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 146)
Type: Auction, Area control 
Number of players: 3-5
Age of players: 12+
Length: 60-90 minutes
Game Description: Control of India at the beginning 18th century is up for grabs. The 200 year-long rule of the Grand Moguls has collapsed. Now is the time for the most powerful Maharishis and princes to take control of the Indian subcontinent. The players use strategy and cunning to win influence over India, province by province and city by city. The most successful player (and the winner) is the one who establishes the most magnificent palaces and has the most power in the end. </notes>

    <notes>Pristine, never played.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

Shipping in the U.S.A. will be USPS Priority Mail 2-Day Delivery (comes with tracking # and up to $50 insurance coverage). Mailing cost for most games will be $10.00 or less for USA delivery. Heavier games will be more expensive, but you can choose Standard Mail (delivery time 5-7 days) to get a lower shipping cost. Send me a message with your ZIP Code to ask for a firm price. Shipping discount available for multiple items on the same order (contact me for a price).

Theme: Control of India at the beginning 18th century is up to grabs. The 200 year-long rule of the Grand Moguls has collapsed. Now is the time for the most powerful Maharishis and princes to take control of the Indian subcontinent. The players use strategy and cunning to win influence over India, province by province and city by city. The most successful player (and the winner) is the one who establishes the most magnificent palaces and has the most power in the end.

A common complaint I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen is that you can run out of palaces. I have extra palaces in each colour that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll add so that you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t run out during the game.</notes>

    <notes>Insert thrown out. 
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>
