The battle ignites in the Mountains of Sorrow!
The Mountains of Sorrow are aptly named, for they have been the site of the unending clash between Goblin and Dwarf. The Cave Goblins seek merely to throw themselves upon any foe with the will to fight. The Guild Dwarves sit in their mountain halls, jealously guarding their ancient riches. But with the discovery of the Summoning Stones comes a new kind of combat, and now these two great races will help set off the War for Itharia.
Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins gives players everything they need to join the War for Itharia, as either of these great races. Will you play the Guild Dwarves, whose knowledge of siege warfare knows no rival? Or will you play the Cave Goblins, and swarm your foe with your fanatical hordes?
This Summoner Wars Starter Set provides two complete Faction decks, as well as all the materials needed to play games of Summoner Wars.

    <notes>Plaid Hat Games (PLDSWGDCG)
 The Mountains of Sorrow are aptly named, for they have been the site of the unending clash between Goblin and Dwarf. The Cave Goblins seek merely to throw themselves upon any foe with the will to fight. The Guild Dwarves sit in their mountain halls, jealously guarding their ancient riches. But with the discovery of the Summoning Stones comes a new kind of combat, and now these two great races will help set off the War for Itharia. Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins gives players everything they need to join the War for Itharia, as either of these great races. Will you play the Guild Dwarves, whose knowledge of siege warfare knows no rival? Or will you play the Cave Goblins, and swarm your foe with your fanatical hordes? This Summoner Wars Starter Set provides 2 complete Faction decks, as well as all the materials needed to play games of Summoner Wars.</notes>

    <notes>English first edition.
Complete and in very good condition.  Also selling Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs.
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately.  
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost.  I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.
Thank you</notes>
