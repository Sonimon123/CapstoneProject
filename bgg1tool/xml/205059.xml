   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a fully cooperative, app-driven board game of horror and mystery for one to five players that takes place in the same universe as Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign. Let the immersive app guide you through the veiled streets of Innsmouth and the haunted corridors of Arkham's cursed mansions as you search for answers and respite. Eight brave investigators stand ready to confront four scenarios of fear and mystery, collecting weapons, tools, and information, solving complex puzzles, and fighting monsters, insanity, and death. Open the door and step inside these hair-raising Mansions of Madness: Second Edition. It will take more than just survival to conquer the evils terrorizing this town._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>NIS
I preordered this game and was able to play someone else copy.  I do not tihink this one will be coming t my family game nights so my mistake could be your gain.
This box is pretty large and the game with the mini is a bit heavy so shipping may be a bit more than I am used to.  I am thinking it will be around $15.00 due to the odd size.
I only except paypal and ship in the Continental US</notes>

    <notes>Game is great shape. Played once and decided it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for us.
 One of the monster bases came slightly damaged but it wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t impact gameplay and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure Fantasy Flight would replace the base. [The monster bases all have slots for little cardboard tokens that you use to differentiate between multiple copies of the same monster. One of the bases has a damaged slot, but even if you used all of that monster type, the one with a damaged base would have no marker and each of the other copies would utilize one].
Shipping or pickup from 10014. I will calculate shipping costs and let you know what they are. I will ship on the same day I receive payment.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition with minimal plays (many components unused).  Enemies all assembled, with figures glued into stands.  Figures will be packed with bubble wrap to ensure no problems during shipping.  Tokens sorted into chit tray with cover for ease of use.
Ships from Falls Church, VA (22042) via lowest-cost insurable option of USPS, UPS, or FedEx, within 1 business day of receipt of payment. I have a mail scale and purchase postage digitally, so will provide you with exact shipping cost including discounts for online purchase of postage. I am able to offer local pickup on weekends in Arlington (infant + job limits my availability and travel options).
This is a non-smoking home without pets, and I take great care to maintain my games, even those that are played heavily (this one has only been played 2/3 times, with the first _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; second missions).</notes>

I have listed the game as very good condition instead of like new since 4 of the larger miniatures are glued to their bases as they did not stay in well when I first bought the game. 
Order will ship via FedEx ground with tracking and insurance within 1 business day of purchase for a flat $10 to any continental USA address. 
PayPal is the preferred method of payment.

    <notes>This listing is for a lightly used copy of Mansions of Madness: Second Edition.  This listing also includes the Beyond the Threshold expansion.  The game will come shipped with a GO7 Gaming HDF insert, assembled in the box.  All monsters are super glued to their respective bases and seated in the game insert.  All cards are sleeved with FFG Orange (Tarot) card sleeves.  There is only wear to the exterior of the game box due to vertical storage on shelves.   There is no wear to the game components whatsoever.
I will only ship via UPS to the CONUS (no PO boxes) and will only accept payment via Paypal.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but never played. Coming off a successful painting of miniatures from a board game I decided I wanted to paint this one. I bought Mansions of Madness (along with the Recurring Nightmares _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Suppressed memories expansions both of which are included in this sale and no I will not separate them) set to priming everything and then got bogged down and never finished it. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s now been over a year since I last picked up a paint brush. The work I did isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bad (you can see pics of the state of the miniatures posted in this listing, these are the only ones that were painted) Anything not shown with paint there is done in a black primer. Since the colors for the player characters were more vibrant, I decided to use a white primer that I had nothing but trouble with. I have replaced all but 2 of the player characters (you can see which 2 in the photos above) with new ones from Fantasy Flight (which have not been primed/as they would have come in the box state) so you can start fresh with almost all of them. The white-primed minis are still in the box and you can always get the primer off and try again :) So that is why you are seeing the base game and two big-box expansions for this wonderful low price INCLUDING pre-primed minis and even some already done! As an added bonus, ALL THE CARDS HAVE BEEN SLEEVED and I will be including those sleeves. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll even toss in the paints I was using! xD Painting minis just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me hehehe
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 10 pounds so figure an extra pound or so of packing material.</notes>

Buyer is responsible for postage: ($18 for Mansions or $31 for both games. USPS flat rate).
