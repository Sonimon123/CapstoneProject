   <description>Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;advanced variant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

60 full-color Troop cards and 10 Tactics cards 
9 Flags (plastic pieces) 
4-page Rule Book 
PUBLISHED 2000, 2004, 2007
DESIGNER Reiner Knizia 
COORDINATOR Andy Lewis

COVER AND CARD ART Rodger B. MacGowan 
CARD DESIGN Mark Simonitch 
PRODUCERS Gene Billingsley, Tony Curtis, Andy Lewis, 
Rodger MacGowan, Mark Simonitch
Battle Line is a two-player card game built around the theme of warfare during the age of Alexander the Great. Battle Line features 60 full-color Rodger MacGowan/Mark Simonitch cards depicting the prominent formations of the period (War Elephants, Heavy Cavalry, Phalanx, etc.) and 10 full-color tactics _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wildcards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last. 
Battle Line takes about 30 minutes to play. To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions. 
How will you muster your battle line? Will you use your elephants to trample a hole in the enemy front, or send Alexander to the front to win a critical flag? Maybe you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll dispatch the Companion cavalry to lead or reinforce a crucial point in the line, or perhaps you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s advances. 
In Battle Line, you and your opponent lead the combined arms of the greatest units of the era. Will you, like Alexander, reign supreme? Play Battle Line, and find out.

Battle Line is a two-player card game built around the theme of warfare during the age of Alexander the Great. Battle Line features 60 full-color Rodger MacGowan/Mark Simonitch cards depicting the prominent formations of the period (War Elephants, Heavy Cavalry, Phalanx, etc.) and 10 full-color tactics _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wildcards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last. 
Battle Line takes about 30 minutes to play. To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions. 
How will you muster your battle line? Will you use your elephants to trample a hole in the enemy front, or send Alexander to the front to win a critical flag? Maybe you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll dispatch the Companion cavalry to lead or reinforce a crucial point in the line, or perhaps you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s advances. 
In Battle Line, you and your opponent lead the combined arms of the greatest units of the era. Will you, like Alexander, reign supreme? Play Battle Line, and find out.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 001207)
Battle Line is a two-player card game built around the theme of warfare during the age of Alexander the Great. Battle Line features 60 full-color Rodger MacGowan/Mark Simonitch cards depicting the prominent formations of the period (War Elephants, Heavy Cavalry, Phalanx, etc.) and 10 full-color tactics _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wildcards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last. 
Battle Line takes about 30 minutes to play. To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions. 
How will you muster your battle line? Will you use your elephants to trample a hole in the enemy front, or send Alexander to the front to win a critical flag? Maybe you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll dispatch the Companion cavalry to lead or reinforce a crucial point in the line, or perhaps you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s advances. 
In Battle Line, you and your opponent lead the combined arms of the greatest units of the era. Will you, like Alexander, reign supreme? Play Battle Line, and find out. </notes>

Battle Line is a two-player card game built around the theme of warfare during the age of Alexander the Great. Battle Line features 60 full-color Rodger MacGowan/Mark Simonitch cards depicting the prominent formations of the period (War Elephants, Heavy Cavalry, Phalanx, etc.) and 10 full-color tactics _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wildcards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that give players extra flexibility and choices and help make each new battle wildly different from the last. 
Battle Line takes about 30 minutes to play. To win, you must create powerful formations along your side of the line of battle that are superior to those of your enemy. Victory goes to the player who wins 5 of the 9 battle flags (an envelopment) or three adjacent flags (a breakthrough). Based on Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original design published in Germany as Shotten-Totten, Battle Line enhances and expands that game system to give players even more tactical options and gut-wrenching decisions. 
How will you muster your battle line? Will you use your elephants to trample a hole in the enemy front, or send Alexander to the front to win a critical flag? Maybe you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll dispatch the Companion cavalry to lead or reinforce a crucial point in the line, or perhaps you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ll rely on your spies to determine the enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s strengths and weaknesses before committing your best forces. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll always have plenty of choices. With every card play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll determine the strength and direction of your attack while plotting to fend off your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s advances. 
In Battle Line, you and your opponent lead the combined arms of the greatest units of the era. Will you, like Alexander, reign supreme? Play Battle Line, and find out. </notes>

Ancient battles were fought in organized formations. The leaders of both sides directed their forces along the battle line to gain tactical advantage in order to overwhelm their opponent in the center, breakthrough one of his flanks, or hold their position until the time came for a decisive move. How will you muster your battle line? Your objective is to create powerful formations on your side of the nine Flags, in order to beat the formations on your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s side of the respective Flags. The first player to win three adjacent Flags (a Breakthrough) or any five Flags (an Envelopment) achieves victory. </notes>

2011 Version, Ancient battles were fought in organized formations. The leaders of both sides directed their forces along the battle line to gain tactical advantage in order to overwhelm their opponent in the center, breakthrough one of his flanks, or hold their position until the time came for a decisive move. How will you muster your battle line? Your objective is to create powerful formations on your side of the nine Flags, in order to beat the formations on your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s side of the respective Flags. The first player to win three adjacent Flags (a Breakthrough) or any five Flags (an Envelopment) achieves victory. </notes>

    <notes>My late husband was an avid board game collector.  It is time for the games to find new homes, hopefully to someone who enjoys them as much as he did.  All his games are in excellent condition, he took very good care of them.   If he did play the games, no eating or drinking was allowed.  
Please feel free to ask any questions.   Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Like new Battle Line, I ordered it off Amazon.co.uk, played few times and now I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m done with it  :) 
Before I played the game I put the cards in card covers, so everything is in excellent condition.
Please add 2 pounds for shipping if in the UK and add 3.5 for shipping outside the UK, thanks!
Hope you enjoy! 
ps: I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really know which printing/year/version this is, but the picture from Amazon has a copyright 2004 on the box.
pps: the versions are all the same as far as I know :)</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>GMT Games, 2011 printing. 
Game is complete and in excellent condition, only ever played with card sleeves (sleeves not included).  
For this printing of the game, GMT used a thicker card stock with a tougher, glossy card finish.  Cards look durable, especially compared to earlier printings of the game.</notes>

Will include the FFG red deck box pictured [geekurl=/image/1485754/battle-line]here[/geekurl]
The rules have been folded to fit into the deck box. 
Will include the original box if you want it but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use it because the plastic insert doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really match/fit this game.</notes>
