   <description>Description from BoardgameNews_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Designed by Uwe Rosenberg
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.
No. of players: 1-5
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 120-180 minutes</notes>

    <notes>Description of Game (quoted from box back):
“Players start the game with two family members living in a two-room wooden hut. In each round, each member of their family may choose one action. If they collect wood and reed, they can extend their hut and then add to their family.
Family growth allows additional actions, but has the disadvantage that more food must be produced. And to get food, the players plow fields and plant seeds.
The planted grain and vegetables are harvested during the Harvest, when animals breed as well. To raise animals, pastures must be fenced to allow sheep, wild boar and cattle to graze.
Occupations or Improvements can ensure a family’s upkeep. Each of these cards allows the player a small advantage in the game.
Victory Points are earned when players renovate their wooden hut to a clay hut and later even a stone house. But everything else to do with balancing food requirements or making every day life a little more comfortable can earn Victory Points – especially Family growth.
Each game uses a different group of the 166 different Occupation cards and 146 different Improvements, ensuring that no two games are exactly alike. Additional rules for a Solo game and a shortened Family game ensure appropriate challenges for each gaming table.”
Game Contains:
# 9 double-sided boards
# 138 Good tokens
# 36 Food tokens
# 54 Animal cubes
# 25 Person tokens
# 75 fences
# 20 stables
# 24 Hut tiles

In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.

Description of Game (quoted from box back):
“Players start the game with two family members living in a two-room wooden hut. In each round, each member of their family may choose one action. If they collect wood and reed, they can extend their hut and then add to their family.
Family growth allows additional actions, but has the disadvantage that more food must be produced. And to get food, the players plow fields and plant seeds.
The planted grain and vegetables are harvested during the Harvest, when animals breed as well. To raise animals, pastures must be fenced to allow sheep, wild boar and cattle to graze.
Occupations or Improvements can ensure a family’s upkeep. Each of these cards allows the player a small advantage in the game.
Victory Points are earned when players renovate their wooden hut to a clay hut and later even a stone house. But everything else to do with balancing food requirements or making every day life a little more comfortable can earn Victory Points – especially Family growth.
Each game uses a different group of the 166 different Occupation cards and 146 different Improvements, ensuring that no two games are exactly alike. Additional rules for a Solo game and a shortened Family game ensure appropriate challenges for each gaming table.”

In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo.

This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo.

All the cards that have been opened were put directly into card protectors (included) which are color coded by card type.  Only the Z-deck and Basic deck are open - the others are still in shrink-wrap.  Two hinged-plastic bits-storage boxes are included - they fit inside the box and hold all the resources.  The boxes even have labels in the same font as the title on the box cover!
The resources and farmer disks are stickered (on one side only) like this:

In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.
No. of players: 1-5
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 120-180 minutes

    <notes>In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo.

In Agricola, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else.

You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
The rules include a beginner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s version and an advanced version.
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).
Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference.
Each player also starts with a hand of 7 job cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 item cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of: there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you are better off reacting to what your opponents do.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7026)
Designed by Uwe Rosenberg
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.
No. of players: 1-5
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 120-180 minutes

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7026)
Designed by Uwe Rosenberg
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.
No. of players: 1-5
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 120-180 minutes</notes>

Nota bene: As this game weighs 2.4 kilos, shipping costs for anywhere other than the UK will be quite high. I will ship it anywhere in the UK for £8. For any other locations, please request a quote via geekmail.</notes>

Designed by Uwe Rosenberg
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.
No. of players: 1-5
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 120-180 minutes

In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. 
Contents: 360 cards, over 300 wooden components, 50+ tiles, 9 boards, tokens, scoring pad.
No. of players: 1-5
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 120-180 minutes

Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).

Each player also starts with a hand of 7 job cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 item cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of: there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you are better off reacting to what your opponents do.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7026)
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. </notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and in very nice condition.  We have played it 6-8 times, but everything still looks great.  I love this game, but unfortunately my gaming counterparts do not.  They reason, clearly, is because I destroy them when we play. :_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;)
Shipping will be added on once we assess the options.  The game is heavy so its probably going to be around $12 or so.  </notes>

Also includes animeeples, so you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to just play with the cubes for the sheep, cows, and pigs. Buyer pays $7.00 shipping. I can try to consolidate shipping costs if you purchase multiple games. Thanks for looking. Local Chicago pickup also available.</notes>

    <notes>This is a lightly used copy of Agriocla.  I bought it a few years ago and only have played it a few times.  No one has any desire to play it so I must sell it.
All the pieces come in an organizable container which is free to the buyer if they want it.
I want to sell this rather quickly, so I am open to negotiating.
Shipping will be 14.00 shipped within the continental US.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7026)
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. </notes>

    <notes>THIS ITEM CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED BY Alex V (Vila), AS HE WON IT IN A GEEKLIST AUCTION.  (If you are not him, please do not try to buy this item.)
NOTE: This is NOT for the complete game of Agricola!
Rather, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s for the original wooden (and cardboard) bits for the resources (wood, clay, stone, reed), grain, vegetables, animals (sheep, boar, cattle) and food from the base game. I have replaced these in my set with the animeeples, grain/vegemeeples and the similar wooden bits for resources and food, so I thought I would offer these originals to any interested party.
WHAT YOU GET: 238 bits! 33 round (dark) brown Wood counters, 27 round _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;red_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (light brown, actually) Clay counters, 15 round white Reed counters, 18 round _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;grey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (black, actually) Stone counters, 27 round yellow Grain counters, 18 round orange Vegetable counters, 21 white cubes for Sheep, 18 black cubes for Boars, 15 brown cubes for Cattle, and 36 round yellow cardboard tokens for Food. All the bits are wood, except for the cardboard Food counters.
BONUS!: An additional 60 even-better bits! I will also include Mayday Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Wooden Farm Animal Set (Animeeples For Agricola). This bonus is a set of wooden animals - 25 sheep, 20 boars and 15 cattle - produced by Mayday Games for use in Agricola. Note that these Animeeples are in addition to the original cubes-as-animals from the original game listed in the previous paragraph.
Why It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Cool: A total of almost 300 bits! You could double your current supply so you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to use the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;multiplier chits_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; while playing Agricola. Or, you could use them as bits in another game or your favourite prototype.
Condition: Excellent.</notes>

All of my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games are for sale as well, so if some of those interest you, let me know and we will negotiate a price.</notes>

    <notes>This is the german version of the game.
It was bought new, unpacked and stored away as it turned out that we cannot cope with the german version cards (there is an english instruction included with everything translated - but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bit too cumbersome for me).
So basically it has all the pieces, was literally touched once and remember it is in GERMAN.
Can collect from Worcester/Oxford/London.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7026)
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. </notes>

In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
 
Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.
 
Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.
 
Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. </notes>

Agricola and Lord of the Rings LCG.  They both fit in a large flat rate board game box.  I put $1 extra on it and bought some packaging materials because I am worried about Agricola sliding around during transit.  If you feel this is unfair, geekmail me and I can drop it off.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played about 5 or 6 times and is in good condition.  There is minor shelf wear on the box.  
This is the English Z-man edition of the game.  There are no specialty decks and contains the standard wood bits.  No animeeples.  The box insert has been removed so the plano container that holds the bits will fit in the box.
I will ship this item via USPS priority mail.  Shipping is $11.</notes>

To be honest, this game is not brand new, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better than brand new. I believe you will love it. Enjoy! :D </notes>

    <notes>For $60 I will include the base Agricola game, plus the Farmers on the Moor expansion.  Base game played a bit, but cards and pieces still in good shape.  Only played the expansion a couple times.
Will ship worldwide, though keep in mind this is 2 games, and neither is particularly light; depending on where you are shipping costs will probably be either a bit to very expensive.</notes>

    <notes>This is the german version of the game.
Played this game once as 1-player, so the game is as new.
I will be at Spiel in Essen on friday 19-10, so if you are there also, I could bring the game to avoid shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG7026)
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats? Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do. Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. </notes>

A few of the common cards have been premium sleeved (The ones that go on the game board and would get handled a lot).  The rest are all pristine unplayed as this copy saw almost no usage. Check my many other game listings for combined shipping.  Expansion listed separately.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG7026)
In Agricola (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;farmer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rug rats? Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do. Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. </notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling the base game, farmers of the moor, the gamers deck, and the impossible to find and sought after World Championship Deck as one complete set.
The game is in like new condition. Clean, organized, no damage, and game pieces are organized in a clear plano box container.
This set would cost you 96.98 + shipping from coolstuffinc.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it all together for 70+ shipping. The world championship deck is out of stock and has no plans to be reprinted at this time. I will not sell the items separately. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all or nothing.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my Pimped Agricola collection.
This includes:
Agricola base game
 - bonus Z-deck
 - Custom deck boxes for the big decks
 - Individual containers for bits for faster setup.
Goodies expansion.
Farmers of the Moor expansion.
This is everything you need to have the ultimate Agricola experience (except the dirt under the fingernails).
CoolStuffInc would charge $125.00 for all this stuff new and you still wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get the Z-deck, custom deck boxes or bit containers. Personally I hate to let it go, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not getting played enough to warrant the shelf space. Someone give it a good home.

    <notes>Box has a little bit of wear damage from its initial delivery to me. It never bothered me but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important to note for those who would not be interested in purchasing a game without a pristine box. None of the game components were impacted by this and are in very good condition. For some reason, photos are not uploading to this posting but if you want to see pics of what I am talking about on the box, please send me a geekmail message and I will send you the images.
Please note: This is the ZMan edition without the animeeples.

    <notes>Going along with my most recent sales, this is a copy of a new in box copy of Agricola. This is another game I bought, but due to having little kids I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had no time to play. Rather than hanging on to it for some other time, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather see this go to someone who could get some real fun and value out of it.
Shipping with be $12.35 to anywhere in the US- that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s USPS priority mail flat rate- my actual cost. That gets you really fast shipping, insurance and tracking. If you are in the loop of Chicago I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to have you come grab it for no shipping.
Thanks!
Edit to add: If you buy any additional game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling as well, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cut the shipping in half :)

    <notes>So I got this game and then realized that my gaming group was never going to have the time to play something this involved. I have had it sitting around for a year and never did anything with it except remove the wrapping from the cards. The only issue is that the box has two split corners from when it was shipped to me. 
So, all of the contents are brand new and never used. The box great except for the split corners. 
In any case, a game is meant to be played and we are not going to use it so someone else should have it.</notes>

    <notes>Game is the edition that came with animeeples. I have a small plastic storage box in there that holds the animals and the rest of the resource tokens. All the cards are bagged (no elastics), all player bits are stored in individual bags by color. 
The box has slight damage on a corner, but all pieces and boards are excellent. I never did get around to playing with the cards, we only played the family game a couple of times. We only played it 3 times or so.</notes>

    <notes>Just played Caverna this weekend and no one will play agricola with me again :( I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played it once and everything is in great condition, with no damage to the box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a tackle box to store all of the wooden bits. I can also include the Farmers of the Moor expansion for $16 ($40 total) if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the box for the expansion anymore but they both fit well in the agricola box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship USPS Priority Mail unless otherwise requested. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you a discount for bundle shipping in gratitude for a saved post office trip if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for one of the other random games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling.</notes>

    <notes>I purchased the game brand new from an OLGS, and I have played the game 5 times. The game has been in my possession at all times. All of the game components are in pristine condition, and all components are bagged. The game comes from a smoke-free home.
The box is in great shape overall, but there is a crease on the box lid extending along the bottom (below the barn). This occurred during shipment to me, not while it was in my possession.

    <notes>This is my personal copy of Agricola, which includes the base set, and some, but not all, components from _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Goodies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion. (see https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/73833/agricola-goodies-expansion) Please see pictures of what is included. The game is in good condition. The box has a tear in the corner, and game was used occasionally for several years, so things aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t necessarily shiny anymore. However, the game was well cared for and all the components are kept track of.
Expansion components include:
CZ deck
Ö deck
All the meeples - resources, vegetables, animals (Please note, the original resource cubes are not included)
seasonal deck boards (winter, spring, fall)
I generally ship via USPS medium flat rate box ($13.45) unless you ask for something else, or if the game won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in that box.</notes>

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - Agricola - has been played 6 - 10 times. Box has a few scuff marks (hence the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition) and all the pieces and boards are still in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition. I do take good care of my games :) ...
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/chidentity ...</notes>

    <notes>Components in very good condition--box has a lot of white around the edges and corners. Includes clear plastic box for holding pieces (but the lid of the game box sits like a millimeter too high when the plastic box is inside, so you might decide to take it out).
Buyer pays actual shipping costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just go to the post office and say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the cheapest way to ship this._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Should at least be a medium flat rate box, but maybe regional will be cheaper.
Not the version with little cute animals (which exists, I think?). Just little cute cubes.</notes>

    <notes>One very good used copy of Agricola, Z-Man English edition, for sale.  Complete EXCEPT it only has 27 clay counters and the instructions say 33, which is not a gameplay problem at all.  Scorepad has ~25 sheets remaining.  Tiles, wooden pieces, boards, and the K and I decks are like new.  There is some mild wear on the regular improvement and occupation cards, and the rules have obviously been read a few times and also have a bit of wear.  Game box is perfectly intact with some very mild shelf wear.
At worst, this will ship flat rate to the continental USA, and a regional rate box or UPS package may end up being cheaper.  I take almost any form of payment, from paypal to bitcoin to walmart and USPS money orders or amazon gift certificates.</notes>

These do not prevent the game box from being fully closed. Also includes 3 cards from the O-deck and 8 cards from the L-deck in various languages (plus 3 duplicate cards).

    <notes>This game is like new, carefully bagged from a smoke free home. I usually ship within 24 hours and am very careful in packaging. I ususally use USPS flat rate but can do regional rate if it is cheaper. I ask that you use friends and family with paypal so I do not have to pay fees on actual shipping. I have about 25 games up in the market. Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Selling one copy of the original Z-Man printing of Agricola.
This copy has the original Z-Deck and two of enhanced wood products (animeeples and vegimeeples).
This copy is no longer in shrinkwrap but is unplayed.
I believe that all of the components are present in this copy of the game.  The counters are still unpunched.  The cards have been removed from their shrinkwrap and are segmented by type.
The game box is in excellent shape after all of these years.  There appears to be a very small dent in the game box top near one of the sides.  It is hard to notice.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling my Agricola small card deck expansions (including promos) and Agricola accessories.  Please GeekMail for additional details.</notes>

All game components are in excellent like-new condition - I have marked the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; only because there is a minor blemish on one side of the box.
Feel free to send me a message and make an offer or to suggest a trade. Price listed in Canadian dollars. Buyer pays shipping, and may be grouped with other items. Available for local pick-up in the Toronto Area.</notes>

I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)

This is the 2013 ZMAN edition, now out of print! Contains the original card decks included with the base game (e.g. K Complex Deck, I Interactive Deck), animeepls and resource meepls I have added myself. Please take a look at the photos.
Unfortunetly the postman dropped the box on delivery and it recieved a big dent, so I bought a new copy.

    <notes>1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>
