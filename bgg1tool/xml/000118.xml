   <description>Buying and selling paintings is a very lucrative business, at least that's what Hollywood's led us to believe, and that's the premise of this game.  Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Everything there in great condition. Game has hardly been played.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Mayfair Games (MFG 4402)
Welcome to the high-risk world of art auctions! You seek to earn profits by selling the works of up-and-coming new artists. Players take turns running auctions of different styles, with the highest bidders claiming the artwork to sell at the end of the round. But the value of each painting is based not only on the popularity of the artist, but also on the success of his earlier works!
The goal is to have the most wealth at the end of the fourth round of auctions. Do you have the insight to invest in the artists that will have the most staying power throughout the auction season? Can you manipulate the art market so that your favorite artist will give you the greatest return? Or will you be forced to auction off your most valuable pieces just to keep the doors of your gallery open?

    <notes>Modern Art (1996) from Mayfair
Box:  Light shelfwear with a few dings and dents, the most serious of which are a moderate dent and 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; crease on the box bottom.  Overall the box is in very good condition!
Components:  Complete and in like new condition!   Game does not look like it has been played, as most chips are unstickered.  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

    <notes>New, Mayfair edition in original shrinkwrap. Thought I would get it to the table with my wife but now I realize it has no chance so might as well sell it.  I accept PayPal and only charge the exact shipping.  The game and packing weighs 1 pound 8 ounces so you can calculate U.S. shipping costs from zip code 21702. I will ship worldwide if you are willing to pay the shipping.  Any questions, please ask.  Please see my other items for sale to save on shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Shelf wear on box, components great, only played a few times.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

The game has been played no more than three times.  All components are in perfect condition.  The player screens are folded gently.  Box has minimal wear.  Original German rules and printed and stapled English rules are included.
Modern Art is a classic, Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s great auction masterpiece, and the Spiel Des Jahres for 1993.
Buyer must pay exact shipping and packaging.  I will ship by USPS with tracking, unless requested otherwise.  Shipping from zip 80020 (Colorado).</notes>

    <notes>This is the Hans im Gluck German second edition (SdJ nomination logo) with the Car cover.  The only language-dependence is on the back of the player screens though.  Artwork-wise, this is one of the best versions!  Condition is almost like new, with less wear on the box than I get with some new games.  Contents perfect.

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition. Box is perfect, and the game has seen very little play. This is the German second edition, but the game is completely language independent (the only German you see is in the rulebook), and a printout of the English rules is included.
Shipping via USPS Priority will likely run $8 to $12, depending on where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re located. Local pickup available in the D.C. area.

    <notes>Box has some slight dishing. The chips have had a few stickers applied but the rest of the sticker sheets are unused and intact. There is some slight color _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;rub-off_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the chips from them all having been bagged together. It is most noticeable on the white chips, in the form a slight yellowish or pinkish tint. The rest of the components are in very good condition.

    <notes>***PRICE INCLUDES FREE SHIPPING TO MAINLAND UK**
Please note, this is the 1996 edition from Mayfair which many consider to be superior to the 2004 edition because of the superior components, especially the cards, which are larger and much better quality.
The game is complete and the components are in excellent condition.
The rulebook is slightly marked and the box has some minor signs of wear, mainly a minor dent in the top left corner of the fron of the box.</notes>

    <notes>Hello!  I have once-played copy in very good condition (see photos).  Shipping anywhere is $9 for 2-day with free tracking and insurance.
Additionally, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including a miniature wooden easel that is perfectly sized to hold each card during the auctions (see photos). It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a very fun way to thematically bling your games!  (And it folds to fit in the box nicely).
Thanks very much!

    <notes>Great fun game to play with friends!
Game barely used - only played a few times. Box definitely has wear from being on shelves, but the insides are complete and in great playable condition given that this is a game from the 90s.
Would love to sell this to someone who will play it! Please contact me if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Shipping from DC metro area. Local pickup is also available.
This game is new and still in the shrinkwrap. I purchased this game and it ended up shipping before I could realize it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the game I was intending to buy. Oops.
Payment is expected within 1 week of the invoice being sent via Venmo or Paypal (no-fee payments preferred, thanks).
Shipping costs are calculated according to the lowest price for the buyer. Typically, this will be USPS Priority Mail which includes a tracking #. The weight of the game is ~2 lbs.</notes>

This is just for tracking sales with the Geek so they get commission. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be working nearly all day at First Look and will have the games with me there. You can find me in a grey striped beanie or ask for Yelmel. The other Enforcers at First Look will likely know me.
I accept cash or PayPal to rand.lemley@gmail.com, whatever is easier for you. Just let me know which you prefer.
Looking forward to seeing you and hope you enjoy PAX!
Cheers
