   <description>In Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, a two-player Living Card Game, you take the part of a warlord, leading your armies into battle against your opponent in a bid to claim glorious victory. Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This listing is for the base game.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s opened, two of the starting decks were made and sleeved.  The sleeves are included.  I played it about three times.  You get what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the picture meaning the box insert isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t included.  I removed it so the box would hold more cards.  Everything is in like new shape.  I love card games above all else, but have too many so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this one despite it being designed by the preeminent Eric Land.  Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell Eric on me.</notes>

Cards were only used sleeved, so every thing is in great condition. There will be only one box (all the cards from both sets will be sent). Deck boxes have a little wear, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re supposed to take wear instead of the cards! Demo Deck includes third copies of some space marine and ork cards.
Shipping is from Burbank (91504) or can arrange for local pickup if you live around Los Angeles. As an estimate, shipping from Burbank to New York City was just over $13. No packaging/handling fees unless you want tubes for the mats, that will cost extra. Will combine with my other game sales for better deal on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Hi guys - time to get rid of my Warhammer 40,000 Conquest cards from the popular FFG LCG. Moved on to other games.
There are two Core Sets here, plus one full cycle of 6 chapter packs, all very well taken care of: 
The Howl of Blackmane
The Scourge
Gift of the Ethereals
Zogwort_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Curse
The Threat Beyond
Descendents of Isha
Everything is in great condition and I have boxes for everything if you so desire. Also, i_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw in a bunch of card sleeves if you need them. Postage within the UK included, check with me for other European countries. Please add fees if using Paypal.
Thanks!
PS - if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re anywhere near Edinburgh feel free to collect instead....</notes>

    <notes>I am selling my collection of Warhammer: 40,000 Conquest cards. I intended to get into the game because I liked the 40k universe, but soon found myself having no time for the game. I find it be a good game, and enjoyable - but again, I have no time for it.
I would like to sell it as one collection, hopefully to somebody that knows they want to get into the game and achieve some sort of competitiveness with it. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only missing the most recent War Pack (Boundless Hate). The collection includes the following:
03x Core Sets
01x The Howl of Blackmane
01x The Scourge
01x Gift of the Ethereals
01x Zogwort’s Curse
01x The Threat Beyond
01x Descendants of Isha
01x The Great Devourer
01x Decree of Ruin
All Tokens, Token Cards and Dials are included, along with the Learn to Play Book, Rules Reference, and Reference Sheet from The Great Devourer Expansion. Everything has been stored in deck boxes and is in Near Mint condition, and two of the token sheets are still sealed.</notes>
