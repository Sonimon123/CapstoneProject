   <description>In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can to get first crack at the gems on hand for the taking._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Original edition:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game board consists of six rows, with twelve gems (of various colors) placed in these rows. At the start of play, each player places his pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2015 edition:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7015)
Designed by Grzegorz Rejchtman
Fast! Captivating! Simple!
Fast! Because all players are trying simultaneously to cover their Ubongo spaces with the appropriate tiles.
Captivating! Because you don’t want to stop and excitedly look forward to the next round. 
Simple! Because the rules for playing Ubongo are explained in only a few sentences.
And here’s how the game works: Each player receives their own puzzle board and 12 tiles, all shaped differently. Then one player throws the die and turns the sand timer. Which tiles will have to be placed on each player’s board is determined by the icon on the die. Now each player tries to place their tiles and solve the puzzle as fast as possible. The fastest player shouts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ubongo!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and is allowed to move their pawn on the common game board and take two jewels. Meanwhile the other players continue to solve their puzzle - as long as the sand timer is running, they are allowed to place their tiles and collect jewels. The player who has collected the most jewels of one color is the winner! And that player won’t necessarily always be the fastest.
COMPONENTS 
Contents: 36 double-sided puzzle boards, 72 gems, 4 sets of 12 puzzle tiles, 4 pawns, 1 sand timer, 1 die.
No. of players: 2-4
Ages: 8+
Playing time: 20-30 minutes

    <notes>The box has shelf wear and one dinged corner. But the components are still in very good condition. The game has been played perhaps 3 or 4 times, but it was included in my library game night for a while (thus the shelf wear). 
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way. I will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.</notes>

    <notes>I think Acceptable is underselling it but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing some of the spare gems so there we go (one blue, one yellow). Still has everything you need to play it, though, and in pretty good condition - there don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to be any cardboard splits, all the tiles are clean, that sort of thing. The rules are in German but all the components are language-independent. The insert has a few small cracks in it and the box has some wear on the corners and edges; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lived for a bit but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in good nick and eminently playable, is what I mean. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m based in London and am happy to have you collect it for freesies if you can; otherwise, shipping is £7.00 within the UK first class, for international shipping just drop me a line and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll tell you, I will (if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re willing to pay, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship).</notes>
