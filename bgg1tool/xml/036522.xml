    <notes>Devir (DVR BG2MAYO)
The Game Dos de Mayo is an abstract game of the terrible incidents that took place in Madrid on May 2nd 1808. On that date, civilians in Madrid and a few Spanish army units rebelled against the French occupation troops of Napoleon.
Dos de Mayo is a bilingual (English and Spanish) boardgame for two players, in which each player controls the forces of one side, either Spanish or French. The game lasts 10 turns and takes about 20-30 minutes to play.
Each turn is divided into four phases:
· Preparation
· Orders
· Movement
· Resolution
At the end of Turn 10, the French player achieves victory if all the Spanish forces have been eliminated, all the access areas to Madrid are French garrisoned and has not lost four or more cubes. If a French victory does not apply, the Spanish player wins.
The game includes:
·A board showing the old map of Madrid, divided in 21 areas or zones
·41 wooden cubes: 30 blue (representing the French troops), 10 red (representing the Spanish civilians and troops), and 1 unpainted used as the turn marker.
·22 event cards, 11 French (blue back); and 11 Spanish (red back)
·2 player aid cards
·1 turn track card
·A rulebook, including historical commentaries and a full example of play</notes>

    <notes>Devir (DVR BG2MAYO)
The Game Dos de Mayo is an abstract game of the terrible incidents that took place in Madrid on May 2nd 1808. On that date, civilians in Madrid and a few Spanish army units rebelled against the French occupation troops of Napoleon.
Dos de Mayo is a bilingual (English and Spanish) boardgame for two players, in which each player controls the forces of one side, either Spanish or French. The game lasts 10 turns and takes about 20-30 minutes to play.
Each turn is divided into four phases:
· Preparation
· Orders
· Movement
· Resolution
At the end of Turn 10, the French player achieves victory if all the Spanish forces have been eliminated, all the access areas to Madrid are French garrisoned and has not lost four or more cubes. If a French victory does not apply, the Spanish player wins.
The game includes:
·A board showing the old map of Madrid, divided in 21 areas or zones
·41 wooden cubes: 30 blue (representing the French troops), 10 red (representing the Spanish civilians and troops), and 1 unpainted used as the turn marker.
·22 event cards, 11 French (blue back); and 11 Spanish (red back)
·2 player aid cards
·1 turn track card
·A rulebook, including historical commentaries and a full example of play

Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.

I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY 101203N)
The Game Dos de Mayo is an abstract game of the terrible incidents that took place in Madrid on May 2nd 1808. On that date, civilians in Madrid and a few Spanish army units rebelled against the French occupation troops of Napoleon.
Dos de Mayo is a bilingual (English and Spanish) boardgame for two players, in which each player controls the forces of one side, either Spanish or French. The game lasts 10 turns and takes about 20-30 minutes to play.
Each turn is divided into four phases:
- Preparation
- Orders
- Movement
- Resolution
At the end of Turn 10, the French player achieves victory if all the Spanish forces have been eliminated, all the access areas to Madrid are French garrisoned and has not lost four or more cubes. If a French victory does not apply, the Spanish player wins.</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY 101203N)
Dos de Mayo is based on the terrible events that took place in Madrid on May 2nd 1808. On that date fed up with the abuse by French soldiers and sick of the indolence of Spanish authorities many of whom acted in collusion with the occupying French troops the people of the city rose up in arms against the best army of the time in a desperate attempt to regain their pride through rebellion against the Napoleonic invader. Dos de Mayo is a board game for two players lasting around 20-30 minutes (even less for experienced players) in which each player controls the forces of one side either Spanish or French. The rulebook includes historical commentaries and an example of a full game. </notes>

Set up for local pickup.
Description from auction listing:
Opened and only played once. 
However the card came wrapped only in a brown paper band. Due to this the corners of the cards were free to bump around as the box was handled. They are not in bad shape but not what I would call mint. In addition the back of one of the cards has some glue residue from the paper strip wrap and the back of one of another card seems to have a bit of speckling in the ink. For these reasons I would recommend sleeving the cards in backed sleeves as it is noticeable enough to identify the two cards. All else is in like new condition. I just want to be straight forward so there is no surprises. </notes>

    <notes>Selling one copy of the Gryphon/Gen-X printing of 2 de Mayo.  English and Spanish-language components and rules.
This copy of the game is no longer in shrinkwrap, but has not been played.  The game is still in great shape after all of these years.
Game contents have been verified.  All components (cards, game board, order sheet pad and wooden markers) are in the game box.  Rules are present in both English and Spanish.
The English-language rulebook has a very slight (horizontal) bend roughly in the middle of the booklet.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Just superficial damage.
The game box is in very good condition.  If you look closely, you can see a minor dent/scratch here and there from other boxes being on top of this.  For some reason, there are barely visible remanents of a sticker over the lower left corner of the bottom game box.  No damage to the game box itself, but it is noticable if you look at this bottom corner.
Game comes from a non-smoking home.
I am also selling one copy of the 2 de Mayo: Assault on Palace Grimaldi expansion.  It would be nice to sell these two items together.</notes>
