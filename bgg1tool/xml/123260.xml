   <description>Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Bézier Games (BEZSUBU)
Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice! </notes>

Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice! </notes>

I will send this game to the eventual buyer using the Collect Plus courier service. It will be tracked and needs to be signed for upon receipt. Details can be found at www.collectplus.co.uk.
Post and packing costs will be:
£6.00 delivered to your door, OR
£4.50 delivered to your nearest participating dealer for you to collect. (I recommend this, as you do not have to wait in for delivery. An email is sent when it is ready to be collected.)
Some places within the UK may have to pay additional postage charges. I will contact you if this is the case. If this does apply you are probably more aware of this than me.

    <notes>Bézier Games (BEZSUBU)
Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice! </notes>

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZSUBU)
Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice! </notes>

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZSUBU)
Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice! </notes>

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZSUBU)
Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice!</notes>

As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice!</notes>

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZSUBU)
Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play the same game twice!</notes>

    <notes>The game is unplayed and unpunched. The box, however, has sustained some damage from previous seller.  See photos. 
Shipping via priority flat rate medium-sized box ($13). Buyer to pay shipping. Can also do local pickup.
When paying via PayPal buyer must be OK with selecting the personal option, ie _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;send payment to friends or family._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 
Everything on my trade list is also for sale at below MSRP/negotiable prices. Can combine shipping for several games.</notes>

    <notes>Games has been played a dozen times. All components are in good condition aside from the game box. Please refer to the pictures which shows it in detail. Otherwise the rest of the box is good.  
This sale includes the expansion, Suburbia Inc. Suburbia Inc when bought new doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come with its own box. The higher price for the used games reflects the inclusion of the expansion. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also included a poker chip tray for use with the cardboard money. Helps with organizing. 
Shipping in Canada is about $15.00-20.00cad. EMT accepted as well. 
For US buyers, shipping will more than likely be fairly pricey, but I will provide a quote. 
Due to high shipping costs, I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship to anywhere outside of Canada and USA, sorry!</notes>

    <notes>This item is for an essentially new copy of Suburbia. It has never been played with but the pieces have been punched and organized. Even better, the game comes with a high quality wooden box insert. Unfortunately I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember who the maker is other than it was fairly pricey. 
Shipping will be $14 through FedEx Express.
If you have any questions just send me a geekmail. Thanks!</notes>

The price has been set at the winning bid, or Buy It Now, price posted to the auction item comment page.
If you won multiple items, please be sure to add them all to your cart at once and then check out so I can include them in your shipping estimate.
As a reminder:
I will only ship to the addresses within the United States.
I only accept PayPal and payment details will be sent alongside your final invoice.
Your item(s) will ship on the Saturday FOLLOWING verified payment. 
I will provide tracking information for your item and insurance sufficient to cover the final price of the auction on shipped items.
Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.
If you have any special requests, please Geekmail me so we can discuss prior to payment finalization.
Thank you for your purchase and I hope you enjoy your new game(s)!</notes>
