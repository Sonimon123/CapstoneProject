   <description>In YINSH, the players each start with five rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

International shipping will probably be between $10-$20, but you should message me for an exact quote.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

Sometimes you will have the impression that there is nothing but chaos on the board. You line up a few of your piecesÑand the next thing you notice is that they have changed color! The more pieces on the board, the more difficult it becomes to predict what will happen. But also the more opportunities you have! So do not worry: you will get your chance. Just stay alert, and you will create your own little bit of order in the chaos!</notes>

    <notes>Smart Games - YINSH
Language: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Spanish 
Players: 2
Age: 8+
Duration: about 20 min 
Weight: 0.940 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: he players each start with 5 rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of 5 markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove 3 of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!

Sometimes you will have the impression that there is nothing but chaos on the board. You line up a few of your pieces and the next thing you notice is that they have changed color! The more pieces on the board, the more difficult it becomes to predict what will happen. But also the more opportunities you have! So do not worry: you will get your chance. Just stay alert, and you will create your own little bit of order in the chaos! </notes>

Sometimes you will have the impression that there is nothing but chaos on the board. You line up a few of your pieces and the next thing you notice is that they have changed color! The more pieces on the board, the more difficult it becomes to predict what will happen. But also the more opportunities you have! So do not worry: you will get your chance. Just stay alert, and you will create your own little bit of order in the chaos! </notes>
