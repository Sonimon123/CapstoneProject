   <description>DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is part of project GIPF._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition.  It has been played several times, but the box shows no wear.  I am selling my entire collection of Gipf so if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, please look in the other Gipf games for the entire collection minus Yinsh.
All games are in excellent condition being in slightly played status.  If you have any questions feel free to ask!
If you are interested in purchasing multiple games, or the entire collection let me know and I will combine shipping for all games.

Length: 15 minutes
Game Description: 
DVONN is a challenging stacking game with very simple rules. It is played with 3 red DVONN pieces, 23 white pieces, and 23 black pi eces. The players must try to control as many pieces as possible by building stacks, preferably by jumping on top of their opponentâ€™s pieces. While doing so, pieces and stacks must remain linked to the red DVONN pieces. If not, they are out of the game! When no more moves can be made, each player puts their stacks on top of each other. The player with the highest stack wins the game! GIPF is the first and central game of Project GIPF, a series of 6 games for 2 players. TAMSK is the second game, ZERTZ the t hird, and DVONN the fourth. The Project is a system that makes it possible to combine games - not only the games of the project itself, but any game or challenge. This system is based on the use of potentials. Each game of the project introduces its own new potential into GIPF.</notes>

    <notes>Smart Games - DVONN
Language: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Spanish 
Players: 2
Age: 8+
Duration: about 20 min 
Weight: 0.850 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players first place the DVONN-pieces on the board and next their own pieces. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO183)
DVONN is a challenging stacking game with very simple rules. It is played with 3 red DVONN pieces, 23 white pieces, and 23 black pieces. The players must try to control as many pieces as possible by building stacks, preferably by jumping on top of their opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pieces. While doing so, pieces and stacks must remain linked to the red DVONN pieces. If not, they are out of the game! When no more moves can be made, each player puts their stacks on top of each other. The player with the highest stack wins the game! GIPF is the first and central game of Project GIPF, a series of 6 games for 2 players. TAMSK is the second game, ZERTZ the third, and DVONN the fourth. The Project is a system that makes it possible to combine games - not only the games of the project itself, but any game or challenge. This system is based on the use of potentials. Each game of the project introduces its own new potential into GIPF. </notes>

If in doubt please ask or refer to DHL_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s postage calculator. I round DHL-prices up to cover expenses for packing materials.
Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; BIC) or paypal. Buyer assumes any fees. For paypal see paypal.com for exact details or refer to the table below.
Paypal fees are kinda complicated, so please bear with me
Account registered in: fees
Germany: 1.9% + 0.35 â‚¬
Northern Europe: 3.7% + 0.35 â‚¬
US, Canada, Europe I: 3.9% + 0.35 â‚¬
Europe II: 4.9% + 0.35 â‚¬
anywhere else: 5.2% + 0.35 â‚¬
Total amount to pay: (cost of game + shipping + tracking_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;insurance + 0.35)/(100 - x%)*100
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry Some paypal-sites allow to assume the fees when transfering money. If not I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll tell you the exact amount. So either way you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to do any math at all
