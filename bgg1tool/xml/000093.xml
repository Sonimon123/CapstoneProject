   <description>In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The game is factory shrinkwrapped and has never been openned, but a corner is slightly dinged. It is minor, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to say it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perfect. Still, the game is very difficult to find in the United States (out of print), so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s well worth it. Shipping will be via UPS or Airborne Express. I can provide a tracking number if needed.</notes>

    <notes>English edition, by Rio Grande Games.
New, still in shrink-wrap.  Price is somewhat flexible -- if you have a reasonable suggestion, make an offer and we can proceed from there.
However, the shrink wrap is slightly torn on one corner, and the box has a very small dent/indentation on the bottom edge of one side.  Pictures are available upon request.
Shipping in the US will be $12.  For worldwide rates, please email me.
Side note: I have little feedback here, but please check out my ebay feedback for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;weadockfamily_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; if you are concerned. Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>El Grande: Decennial Edition by Rio Grande Games....which includes all of the greatest El Grande expansions.  
Game was opened, but it was never played.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s technically new, but shrink has been removed.  I ended up using my friend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy to play, so mine never say play.   
All the components are included, and they are actually in their original wrapping/packaging (eg cards have not been opened, the castillo has never been assembled). 
Thanks for looking.  </notes>

    <notes>This is the standard Rio Grande edition, not the recent Decennial version.  So while there are no expansions, the components are nicer than the Chinese-made ones and there are no typos in this version.  The box is a little scuffed a bit, but the components are in fine condition.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to provide images if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.</notes>

    <notes>This is the german Hans im Glück version.
Rating might be better than good looking at the components, but the box shows a bit of wear and the bottom of the box has a split corner.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

Type: Area control 
Number of players: 2 - 5
Age of players: 12+
Length: 60 - 90 minutes
Game Description: The players are the Grandes in old Spain. Each wants to increase his influence at the court and in the regions. Each turn, the players choose from 5 actions, different on each turn. But first choice goes to the player who plays the highest priority card and you have only 13 for the game. Choose your actions and priorities wisely to become the most powerful Grande and win the game!This Decennial version also contains the expansions previously known as Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies, and Grandissimo.In Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, each player has 18 or 28 cards that replace the action cards from the basic game. Before the game begins, each player chooses 13 cards to be his action/priority deck for the game. The players use these cards instead of the action a nd priority cards in determining turn order and special actions. Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies adds four new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and new action cards to support these additions. The new action cards are in two new stack, giving players seven options on each turn instead of the five from the basic game. By combining the two, you can play The King _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies. In this game, you use the action/priority cards from Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, and the new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and the new action cards supporting them from Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies.Grandissimo adds a ship, jail, Portugal, the Grand Inquisitor, the Queen, the Jester, and new action cards in two new stacks to support these additions.Errata - due to printing problems with the cards, there are 5 cards with incomplete text on them. The complete text is in the rules. The affected cards are shown below:From the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stack:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue: Move all of your own Caballeros from...any one region!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue: Move any 4 of your own Caballeros on...the board!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;From the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stack:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Your fellow players must send all of their own Caballeros from one region back to the provinces.

    <notes>Relisting at $29 plus $10 to ship in USA (shipping from southern California) for a new still-shrink-wrapped copy of El Grande Decennial Edition (all expansions included). 
The box is in mint condition.  The only reason I am listing it so low is because I want to sell it sooner rather than later.
I will accept payment by PayPal from a verified address/account. I would prefer a non-credit card payment so I can skip the PayPal fee - if you pay by credit card, then the price is $31 plus $10 shipping.
Thanks! :)</notes>

I am selling _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The El Grande Expansions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in a separate listing, if you are interested.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 284)
Type: Area control 
Number of players: 2 - 5
Age of players: 12+
Length: 60 - 90 minutes
Game Description: The players are the Grandes in old Spain. Each wants to increase his influence at the court and in the regions. Each turn, the players choose from 5 actions, different on each turn. But first choice goes to the player who plays the highest priority card and you have only 13 for the game. Choose your actions and priorities wisely to become the most powerful Grande and win the game!This Decennial version also contains the expansions previously known as Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies, and Grandissimo.In Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, each player has 18 or 28 cards that replace the action cards from the basic game. Before the game begins, each player chooses 13 cards to be his action/priority deck for the game. The players use these cards instead of the action a nd priority cards in determining turn order and special actions. Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies adds four new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and new action cards to support these additions. The new action cards are in two new stack, giving players seven options on each turn instead of the five from the basic game. By combining the two, you can play The King _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies. In this game, you use the action/priority cards from Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, and the new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and the new action cards supporting them from Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies.Grandissimo adds a ship, jail, Portugal, the Grand Inquisitor, the Queen, the Jester, and new action cards in two new stacks to support these additions.Errata - due to printing problems with the cards, there are 5 cards with incomplete text on them. The complete text is in the rules. The affected cards are shown below:From the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stack:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue: Move all of your own Caballeros from...any one region!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue: Move any 4 of your own Caballeros on...the board!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;From the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stack:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Your fellow players must send all of their own Caballeros from one region back to the provinces.

    <notes>This is the German edition of the game, but has translations of all the rules and cards in English.
This game has been played once or twice (before I got an English edition), and there is minor bending of some of the cards from rubber bands.  The box also has scuffs on the edges and corners.  Nonetheless, all the pieces and cards are present and in good shape, and the game is ready to play.
Shipping in the US:  Parcel post $14.00, Priority mail $18.00.  International pricing available on request.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games - El Grande Decennial
Language: English
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 12+
Duration: about 90 min
Weight: 1,980 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: This decennial edition contains the basic game AND all of the following expansions: Grandissimo, Intrique _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the king, Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the colonies, the King _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the colonies!!!!
In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various provinces. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of provinces. After every third turn, the regions are scored, and after the ninth turn, the Grande with the most points is deemed the winner.

    <notes>Dicenniel Edition - played maybe 4 or 5 times, some wear to the box (from being transported in a rucksack when on loan for a games night! :( ) otherwise complete and contents in great shape.
Paypal preferred for speed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; security.
Very reasonable courier shipping to Europe available (works out especially good when combining multiple games!)
I cannot possibly hope to provide in advance a shipping quote for every destination, especially when combining games, so please do ask!

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 284)
Type: Area control 
Number of players: 2 - 5
Age of players: 12+
Length: 60 - 90 minutes
Game Description: 
The players are the Grandes in old Spain. Each wants to increase his influence at the court and in the regions. Each turn, the players choose from 5 actions, different on each turn. But first choice goes to the player who plays the highest priority card and you have only 13 for the game. Choose your actions and priorities wisely to become the most powerful Grande and win the game!This Decennial version also contains the expansions previously known as Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies, and Grandissimo.In Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, each player has 18 or 28 cards that replace the action cards from the basic game. Before the game begins, each player chooses 13 cards to be his action/priority deck for the game. The players use these cards instead of the action a nd priority cards in determining turn order and special actions. Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies adds four new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and new action cards to support these additions. The new action cards are in two new stack, giving players seven options on each turn instead of the five from the basic game. By combining the two, you can play The King _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies. In this game, you use the action/priority cards from Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, and the new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and the new action cards supporting them from Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies.Grandissimo adds a ship, jail, Portugal, the Grand Inquisitor, the Queen, the Jester, and new action cards in two new stacks to support these additions.Errata - due to printing problems with the cards, there are 5 cards with incomplete text on them. The complete text is in the rules. The affected cards are shown below:From the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stack:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue: Move all of your own Caballeros from...any one region!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue: Move any 4 of your own Caballeros on...the board!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;From the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stack:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Your fellow players must send all of their own Caballeros from one region back to the provinces.

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

    <notes>This is the first German edition of El Grande by Hans im Glueck. Please note that this is in German, from rules to cards. You will either need to make paste up stickers to put on the cards or consult the rules translation (included).
Game has only been played once (years ago) and is in excellent condition. Box has some wear on corners, consistent with storage, but has no split corners or dents. The main issue with the game is that when I got it back in the 1990s, it was missing two blue cubes and one green cube. I made replacements out of other game parts I had: you can see them in the image below. It is relatively easy to obtain wooden game cubes now -- back then it was not. The cards are in near mint condition, having been handled very little.
Please note that, if you are interested, I also have the Koenig _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Intrigant expansion available for an additional $5.00. (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewitem_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;itemid=365486).</notes>

    <notes>The players are the Grandes in old Spain. Each wants to increase his influence at the court and in the regions. Each turn, the players choose from 5 actions, different on each turn. But first choice goes to the player who plays the highest priority card and you have only 13 for the game. Choose your actions and priorities wisely to become the most powerful Grande and win the game!
This Decennial version also contains the expansions previously known as Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies, and Grandissimo.
In Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, each player has 18 or 28 cards that replace the action cards from the basic game. Before the game begins, each player chooses 13 cards to be his action/priority deck for the game. The players use these cards instead of the action a nd priority cards in determining turn order and special actions. Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies adds four new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and new action cards to support these additions. The new action cards are in two new stacks, giving players seven options on each turn instead of the five from the basic game. By combining the two, you can play The King _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies. In this game, you use the action/priority cards from Intrigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the King, and the new regions, the Grand Inquisitor, and the new action cards supporting them from Grand Inquisitor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Colonies.
Grandissimo adds a ship, jail, Portugal, the Grand Inquisitor, the Queen, the Jester, and new action cards in two new stacks to support these additions.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: El Grande Decennial Edition
Description: El Grande Decennial Edition opened, but unplayed/complete (the Decennial Edition is the version that includes the four expansions)
Shipping Weight: 6 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

The more games you buy though, the less it makes a difference and I will combine shipping happily.

Box shows just a bit of wear. Inside everything there in nice condition except the (pretty useless) inlay is damaged and the king_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s piece has been replaced with a chess king_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s piece (which doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play).

    <notes>This game is in like-new condition and has only been played once. This game will not fit into a USPS Flat-Rate medium box (it is too long), so it will need to be pre-boxed and a shipping quote obtained afterwards once it is packaged.
I will accept PayPal or a USPS money order.
Please sent me a PM if you have any questions.</notes>

The box and components are all complete and in very good (pretty much as-new) condition.  The rules (german, with english print-outs from BGG) have been punched for insertion into a 4-ring binder.

    <notes>If you are looking for used and very rare out of print FIRST EDITION copy of El grande, this is the copy you want to purchase! It is an almost flawless condition! All of the components are accounted for and are in tip top shape.  In fact, the cards and board don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even look like they were ever used.  The only damage is some light corner and edge wear on the box.  I put a picture of the most noticeable spot below. Overall the box is in great shape for being almost 20 years old!  This is a true collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item!  The cardboard insert is tearing in a spot, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not a big issue at all as you can also see in the pictures.  All components are in AMAZING SHAPE!  
Shipping is just $15 to the USA which includes bubble wrap protection and a tracking number sent the day after purchase! This is a big game to ship! I ship well protected and you can check my feedback to confirm this!  Enjoy this rare collectible! 
Ps...pleas message me if you want any specific pictures!  I am more than willing to send anything you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like if you need to see anything else!</notes>

    <notes>This is the Rio Grande Decennial Edition, with all the expansions. Shrinkwrap was removed, game was admired and never played. Literally, I lifted off the cover, looked at the map, and put it back. The cards are still in their shrink wraps, nothing beyond the map was even touched. 
There is very light whitening on a couple of edges from the shelf, but the box is otherwise pristine and still has that new look.
Box is of the same size as Clash of Cultures, Tales of the Arabian Nights, Robinson Crusoe, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing Priority Flat Rate will cost somewhere around $15 or so.
Shipping from 20815, local pickup available.
I have 100% positive rating here and on eBay. Any questions, let me know.</notes>

    <notes>The cards are still shrinkwrapped and the game has never been played, but the outer shrinkwrap was removed (I used to remove the shrinkwrap to check that all of the components were present when I bought a new game).  The one corner looks like the box is creased, but it is more like the material that covers the box is creased as opposed to the box being creased/dented - it was shipped to me like this.  I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it would bother anybody, but I like to mention it in case a buyer is more interested in collecting the game as opposed to playing the game.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

It was only played twice. Board is also in near mint condition. From a smoke free home. Buyer pays actual shipping (from Ohio, 44654). Thanks for looking!</notes>

Only played once since receiving for Christmas in 2003. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s like the used car that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been sitting in Grandma_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s garage and only driven to church on Sundays. Has moved around the country some with me so there is some minor wear on the box edges and an almost imperceptible 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; crease near the upper right corner of the front cover, but otherwise in great condition, with components all intact and in excellent condition as well. Just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t getting playtime for me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to buy a crokinole board with the proceeds :)
Happy to provide pics if potential purchaser is interested!</notes>

One piece of the board doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sit quite flat on table, this is a minor issue but is listed here for completeness and the box is slightly worn and has a bit of tape on it.

Game is in German, but there are several printouts of the rules in English, and there is a pack of cards printed in English from Rio Grande Games.
Shipping weight is about 5 pounds.  Please contact us if you have any questions.</notes>

Payment by bank transfer (SEPA: IBAN _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; BIC) or paypal. Buyer assumes any fees. For paypal see paypal.com for exact details or refer to the table below.
Paypal fees are kinda complicated, so please bear with me
Account registered in: fees
Germany: 1.9% + 0.35 €
Northern Europe: 3.7% + 0.35 €
US, Canada, Europe I: 3.9% + 0.35 €
Europe II: 4.9% + 0.35 €
anywhere else: 5.2% + 0.35 €
Total amount to pay: (cost of game + shipping + tracking_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;insurance + 0.35)/(100 - x%)*100
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry Some paypal-sites allow to assume the fees when transfering money. If not I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll tell you the exact amount. So either way you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to do any math at all
