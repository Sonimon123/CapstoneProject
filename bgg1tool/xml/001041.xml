   <description>Players are attempting to score the most points by building up influence in the districts of Venice via their aristocrats. The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups. The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions. The entire game lasts three Passages and each Passage may contain several turns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;62 Action cards:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;   30 District (5 for each district)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Bridge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;   12 Transfer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;   10 Doge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 Banishment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;28 Limit cards:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;   8 X _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;   10 X _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;   10 X _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Related game:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Canal Grande is a two-player card game based on this game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Esentially this is like new; the components look like they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never been used, the manual doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even have a wrinkle on it (!), and the box looks brand new. However; I did find a small 1/2 inch indent on one corner, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very light and barely noticeable. But, I list it so you know what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting.
I prefer paypal but check or money order is OK too. 
Buyer pays shipping, which I use USPS only. I can only ship to people in the US, sorry. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve no problem at all in telling you how much shipping is going to cost before you buy it!

    <notes>$14.95 to anywhere within the United States. I will combine shipping for multiple items and buyer will pay actual shipping costs.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling over 50 other boardgames and expansions which I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t yet listed on the BGG Marketplace (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m mostly listing the out-of-print games at the moment).  Feel free to browse my collection (any game listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;owned_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but not listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;previously owned_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is also for sale) and send me a message either before or after the auction if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in additional games for combined shipping.  In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling each game for 20% off the lowest online retail price, and almost all of my games are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition - many come with card sleeves, deck boxes, and Plano organizers as well.
And feel free to message me if you would like pictures of this game or any other game that I am selling.
Thanks again!
Jeff

    <notes>The components are like new as the game was never played. Cards are still in original sorting and there are more wooden cubes included than the rules state. The box has some slight wear on the edges only. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s why I list it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and not as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.

    <notes>Ravensburger First Edition
Game board, cards, and other pieces in very good condition. Extra cubes included. The box has some general shelf wear and a name/phone # written on inside of top cover. One corner of the top cover is very worn (artwork worn off). Another corner is worn, but not as bad. See images for pictures of the damage.
I can ship this priority mail or standard mail, whichever is cheaper for your zip code.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of San Marco has been played once.  Even after one play, the game is close to excellent condition.
All game contents verified.  All 12 plastic bridges are present as well as the many wooden counters, game cards and game map.  The map is in fine shape as well as the rules (rules in many languages, including English).
The plastic insert is still intact with no visible damage
The game box is in excellent shape after all of these years (10-15!).  The only visible damage is the wear and tear around the corners of game box bottom.  Other than that, this game looks in great shape.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>
