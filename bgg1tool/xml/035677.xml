   <description>In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Like new copy of Le Havre. Game was ordered through CoolStuffInc and is  marked as Australian edition. There is no difference between this and the US specific release as far as I can tell. 
Chits punched, cards sleeved, skimmed through rule book, and the game never hit the table. Like new condition and complete.
Price includes Mayday sleeves already on cards, and small tupperware style containers for the individual bits. 
I accept paypal only, and will only ship within the US. Shipping will be $11.00 through USPS priority flat rate. Thanks for looking.</notes>

The shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

    <notes>This is the first English (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Australian_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) edition of Le Havre, plus Le Grande Hameau expansion, plus the Essen Promo Cards expansion.  All in excellent condition, with the counters stickered up with the Spielbox stickers that were printed a year or two ago.... 
BUT...
... when I first received this game straight from it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original Essen release, the game box arrived half squashed and looked awful.  I tossed the box and moved the contents into an Agricola: Farmers of the Moor box, which is half the size of the original Le Havre box.  I did save the spine of the original box and pasted it onto the Farmers of the Moor box, so you can at least see it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Le Havre.
So note THERE IS NO ORIGINAL BOX, just the contents, in a AGRICOLA FARMERS OF THE MOOR box.  See images below.</notes>

    <notes>This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much. All of the game components (cards, counters, boards, rules, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game 3 or 4 times. The punched counters have been carefully separated, trimmed, sorted and bagged. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.

    <notes>English language (aka Australian) Lookout Games edition.  Appears to be a 2010 printing based on the 2008-2010 copyright on the back of the box.
New in shrink... a 1 inch rip in shrink near top but all ok below... a 4 inch long rip near bottom which looks like it was caused by it being swiped by a pointy corner of another game which also has caused a 3 inch or so long pen tip wide depression. </notes>

    <notes>Latest Z-Man edition w/Grand Harneau inside, brand new in factory shrinkwrap.
I use priority mail regional rate and USPS Parcel Select to keep shipping costs as low as possible.
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I accept USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments, but your grand total will suffice to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after Paypal takes their fees out, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the transferred amount. So around $2 extra here. OR THERE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S THIS...
I also accept ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price plus exact postage.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, then choose the option of send money to friends and family, NOT to purchase goods. Make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees.)</notes>

    <notes>This is the edition that includes the Le Grand Hameau expansion.  The game is still shrinkwrapped, but one entire corner has the shrinkwrap split open because it must have been shrinkwrapped too tightly.  The game was shipped to me this way, but there is no damage to the box.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

I take very good care of my games, as my collection is very important to me, just looking to make room for newer games as this one turned out to be a non factor for my gaming group and my wife.
Please note that upon buying this game myself I removed the insert from inside the box and placed things all in small _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;snack size_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ziplock bags.
Includes the Le Grand Hameau Expansion (As stated in the version)
Buyer pays shipping, will ship USPS priority

    <notes>Box is ding and dent with some creases but retains its overall shape very well. I believe its the newest edition or close to it...says copywrite 2008-2016.
Bonus...all cards sleeved in premium sleeves and bits have there own separtate plastic mini containers.  Not sure if it had a cardboard insert but if it did it was pitched to accomodate the containers.
Never played at all.  Ships $13.65 flat rate medium box bubblewrapped.</notes>
