   <description>Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Space Hulk (2nd Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Space Hulk (3rd Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Spacehulk/Genestealer/Deathwing set combined.
These are all combined in one set, All the essential parts are present however its not 100% complete. Unfortunately there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s here no good inventory available.  
Here is an inventory of what there is:-
Space Hulk box (One corner repaired, little rubbed on the edges up but sound)
Space Hulk missions and background
Space Hulk Rules
Genestealer rules and Missions booklet
Deathwing rules and Missions booklet (Tape on the spine to prevent
further splitting, two intro pages in poor condition rest okay)
11* Space marine Figures
18* Genestealer Figures (2  missing an arm)
3* Librarians(One has a damaged weapon)
8* Hybrids (1  missing an arm)
78* Floor tiles
36 * Object tiles (Hole, Junk, covers,  Cryo  etc..)
13* Geotiles
20*Door counters
20*Slotta bases
44*Psychic attack cards
2*Hellfire Markers
2*Vortex Marker
2*Stasis Markers
2*Miasma Markers
2*Jinx Markers
2*Warp Time Markers
5*Power Field Generator Blips
1*Trump Suit Counter
4*False Alarm/Alarm Markers
37*Green Blip Markers
2*Redblip Markers
1*CAT marker
1*Ship_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Log
4*Plasma gun  Fired/recharging counter
8*Overwatch/Jam counter
12*Flamer effect marker
From my best estimation the counters appear to be complete, but there are no dice and there appears to be four Space marine, eight Genestealers and two Librarian figures missing.  But even with these missing the game is quite playable and you have all the expansion sets in one

    <notes>Double boxed set of the game, includes 24 genestealers, 10 power armored marines and 10 plastic terminators (the good 2nd edition ones). All the white dwarf add ons are included as well.  Condition is superb - slight tear in the box corner top.  Interested in selling the game whole, not for trade.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to take pictures of the game if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.
Shipping is included in the price for the US, it would cost the buyer the actual amount if shipped out of the US.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Box has some edge wear and one torn corner. Components: rule and scenario books, score cards, rooms, corners, corridors, intersections, doors, bulkheads, dead ends, stands, dice counted and complete, in excellent condition. All 10 space marines present, not all of them are fully assembled or painted. All 20 genestealers present, one has a broken hand. 28 of the 30 bases for figures present; hopefully not all 30 figures are ever used in any scenario, but they are the standard Games Workshop stand-up bases. Game is supposed to come with 71 counters, but has 85. 1 of 4 space marine entry areas missing (no scenario calls for more than two). Game also includes a strange plastic piece that I cannot account for.</notes>

    <notes>Box is beat up (as one might expect with GW_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cheap boxes of that era), minis are partially painted.  Space Marines are basically done, Tyranids are just started.  Contents are in great shape.  Some of the original plastic terminators are switched out for metal terminators of the same era to add variety to the look.  For example, one terminator captain has a small shield on his arm.
This is the 2nd edition game, everything you need in one box.  In addition, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included a bunch of scenarios found only in White Dwarf.  If I remember correctly it is all the scenarios for 2nd edition released in WD along with all of the new rooms and objectives.  I had a subscription for many years.

    <notes>This is for the 2nd Edition.  All parts are present and in great shape.  The mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are all assembled and fully painted; the Space Marines in Blood Angel red and the Gene Stealers in purple and blue (I copied how the picture looks on the box cover).  Box has some shelf wear but no dishing or tears.  Also included are some print-outs I got from the web years ago.  One looks like the 1st edition Gene Stealer expansion, one is the Deathwing expansion for the 1st edition, and the rest are extra scenarios and map sections.  The scenarios are called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Duty And Honor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Bringer Of Sorrow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fangs Of Fenris_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Fate Of The Sword Of Halcyon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.

    <notes>Box is only acceptable, although fully intact (see pictures).
Components are in excellent condition. This is the copy that is reviewed in the following video:
http://vimeo.com/6173107
I bought it from Josh when he got his 3rd edition copy. I liked the game so much I went ahead and bought a new copy. Then wife saw both boxes and gave me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the look_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. One has to go. 
The game includes several extras (see pictures):
1) additional tiles (those with the brown back in the pictures)
2) additional uncut floor sections (the big sheet-like ones in the pictures)
3) three White Dwarf magazines (#197, #199, #203), in wrapper, with additional scenarios and unpunched cards
4) 2-sided card stock play aids (which look so professional I originally thought they came with the game)
I will happily accept cash for an in-person transfer in the San Francisco bay area. If you let me know in advance, I can carry it with me to LA where I visit every week for a similar no-shipping charges exchange. 
Otherwise paypal only.</notes>

    <notes>This sale is for Space Hulk, the first edition. This item has been removed from its original shrinkwrap but the condition of the box is excellent with only slightly visible shelfwear. No items have been intentionally punched and no figures have been intentionally removed from their sprues. Content is 100%, nothing is missing.
Some marine weapons have come loose from the sprues, as well as three marines. two of those marines are undamaged while the third has a broken antenna. The antenna exists and is inside the box (in a ziplock bag). Another marine still stuck to the sprue has a broken antenna (still stuck to the marine_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s head). Both antennas can easily be glued back on the marines and once painted (even unpainted if one is careful) will not affect the look of the figure.
A true collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item, whether it is to enjoy it on the shelf or actually open it up and play with it.
Pictures of the game, showing condition, are available.
Contact me for further questions about shipping and payment.

There is some box wear (this game is from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;80_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s!), and the some of the little antennae on the marines have snapped.

    <notes>This listing is for the original Space Hulk 1st ed core set plus the Deathwing expansion. They are all in the same box, the Space Hulk box. The box for the expansion is no longer around.
Most of the figures are painted to tabletop standard. The contents are complete with the following exceptions. All but one of the flamer attachments are missing from the core set. Other than this the core set and expansion is complete and all counters, corridors, figures and cards are in good condition.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original Space Hulk (English Edition) and some extra floor tiles and articles.
I estimate that the shipping would be $18 for shipping within the USA, but international shipping would depend on the country.    I can get an exact figure when I have your address.
One of the original 3 space corridor has been replaced with a slightly more used tile....not sure where the original went to.   Also one of the original 6 sided die (it came with 5 normal d6) , has been replacement (not shown in picture) with a die of the same size but different color (black with red spots....I think it make s nice set 2x white with black spots, 2x red with white spots, and 1x black with red spots).  
Components are in good condition.  The box shows some wear....they were pretty flimsy boxes.  There is a slight tear in the Space Hulk rules manual.  Three terminators are missing their antennas, and one of the marines is painted.
Extras:
- 13 extra articles with extra missions/campaigns, variants or rules and campaign for tactical marines.  These articles are not the originals but copies from magazines.  
- extra floor tiles made by me from the articles
- counters for weapons and such as so made by me from the articles.

    <notes>I have the expansion Deathwing, Genestealer and extra metal figures etc. (shown here in the first 3 photos) if you want to contact me with an offer for the complete collection.
Photos taken on 14/09/2016.
As you can see, I have kept them all in great condition from new.
Great condition considering they are all more than 25 years old.
Cheers, Jamie</notes>

    <notes>Includes Deathwing expansion in the same box, BUT not the Deathwing rulebook. You can probably find a PDF online someplace. The Deathwing box is NOT included.
This one is from my childhood and has been lurking in attics for years. Box is a bit beat up. Minis are unpainted. All antennas on Terminators are broken. Genestealers are doing ok, only one has an arm and hand broken off, but you can glue those back on.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve checked the contents against this list and everything is there for both base and Deathwing, with the exception of the Deathwing rulebook:

    <notes>Everything is present _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; correct, intact there are 25 Genestealers rather than 20.
But: 
The shelf-wear on the box is the usual you would expect for a 25 year old box of fairly flimsy construction, the lid is dished and it has a 1 inch tear on the back. 
The Space Marines have the usual broken aerial syndrome -  5/10 are still intact. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve saved all the broken aerials.
The doors all have the usual wear/dents on the bottom where they have been forced into their stands.
Otherwise, you could be playing this game with anyone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy in the early 1990_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s
