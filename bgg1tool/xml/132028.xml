    <notes>Academy Games (AYG5011)
The year is 1941. Germany has defeated Poland, Denmark, Norway, and France with ease. In the morning hours of June 22 over 3 million German soldiers attacked Soviet forces along a 1600 kilometer front heralding the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. Complete surprise was achieved and the Germans struck deep into Soviet territory. The Germans thought that the Soviets would fold like a house of cards. Their officer cadre had been massacred by Stalin, training was poor, and morale low. The Blitzkrieg catches the Soviets by surprise and they lose over 1.75 million men in the first two months alone. The Germans are unstoppable, their Panzers pushing to the very gates of Moscow. But then winter hit and the cold drained the German_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s resources, strength, and morale. The Soviets began striking back in the dead of winter and the momentum began to shift in their favor through the following spring. The bear had awoken! Awakening the Bear! - Russia 1941-42 takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s modern armies. </notes>

    <notes>Academy Games (AYG5011)
The year is 1941. Germany has defeated Poland, Denmark, Norway, and France with ease. In the morning hours of June 22 over 3 million German soldiers attacked Soviet forces along a 1600 kilometer front heralding the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. Complete surprise was achieved and the Germans struck deep into Soviet territory. The Germans thought that the Soviets would fold like a house of cards. Their officer cadre had been massacred by Stalin, training was poor, and morale low. The Blitzkrieg catches the Soviets by surprise and they lose over 1.75 million men in the first two months alone. The Germans are unstoppable, their Panzers pushing to the very gates of Moscow. But then winter hit and the cold drained the German_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s resources, strength, and morale. The Soviets began striking back in the dead of winter and the momentum began to shift in their favor through the following spring. The bear had awoken! Awakening the Bear! - Russia 1941-42 takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s modern armies. </notes>

    <notes>ACADEMY GAMES (AYG5011)
The year is 1941. Germany has defeated Poland, Denmark, Norway, and France with ease. In the morning hours of June 22 over 3 million German soldiers attacked Soviet forces along a 1600 kilometer front heralding the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. Complete surprise was achieved and the Germans struck deep into Soviet territory. The Germans thought that the Soviets would fold like a house of cards. Their officer cadre had been massacred by Stalin, training was poor, and morale low. The Blitzkrieg catches the Soviets by surprise and they lose over 1.75 million men in the first two months alone. The Germans are unstoppable, their Panzers pushing to the very gates of Moscow. But then winter hit and the cold drained the German_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s resources, strength, and morale. The Soviets began striking back in the dead of winter and the momentum began to shift in their favor through the following spring. The bear had awoken! Awakening the Bear! - Russia 1941-42 takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s modern armies.</notes>

Counters are punched but hardly played. Cards had been sleeved (unsleeved now).

Within Euro-Zone I do prefer payment via SEPA bank transfer (as it is safe and fast).
If you want to pay via PAYPAL this will normally be OK, too, but please contact me upfront and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to take over all PAYPAL fees.
