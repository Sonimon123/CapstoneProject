   <description>Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.  A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;auction variation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;auction variations_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>BANDU 1991 Milton Bradley.  Complete with instructions, 6 wood Bandu bases, 48 various hardwood objects, 30 bidding beans.  The game was never used and is in Like New condition.  The wood player bases never had the stickers attached, in fact the stickers are missing.  Not a big deal since they are never needed to play and I like them for their looks without them.  The box is nice accept for a place where a store sticker probably was and got ripped off, otherwise solid.  A wonderful item for ones collection.  Shipping weight is 4 pounds.</notes>

Retail price was around $80-90.  Played one time with my family over Christmas and they didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t take to it well enough to want to play it again (shame on them!).  Anyhow, game is fully intact and looks never used - enjoy!
Payment accepted via Paypal - shipping is slightly more than one would expect due to the weight of the game. </notes>

    <notes>Bandu Version: I will call this one very good condition only because when I counted the pieces I came up with 52, not 54 (the 6 bases are counted within that); it is conceivable I miscounted and that would be your gain, my loss as I am pricing it accordingly.  So there is enough present to play; the game is in outstanding condition.  Box, beans, and rules, stickers applied carefully and not coming loose.
For games over $5 each, Buy 4 get $1 off, Buy 6 get 5% off, Buy 8 get 10% off.  Shipping will be actual costs using parcel post.  Insurance is optional; PayPal payments please add 4% to cover PayPal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fees.</notes>

Game Description: There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them, is to build an tower.The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.), as well as a sack of beans for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;auction variation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of the game.Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or, all build one together. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;auction variations_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element.Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills.It´s a game with almost endless building possibilities. It´s a challenge for steadyhands and shaky supense for clever tacticians.

Postage is hard to estimate as I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t currently have a suitable box but I expect the final weight of the parcel to be just under 2kg and dimensions under 90cm (length + width + height). Check the Canada Post website for an estimate of the cost.

Bandu version by Milton Bradley.
All of the wooden pieces are present. There are two extra bidding beans (32). The rules, however, are missing. These can be obtained relatively easily from BGG. 
The box is fairly worn with one piece of clear tape, but it is still sound. The contents are in very good to excellent condition.
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way. I will combine shipping with multiple items. US zip code: 97520.</notes>

Bandu! Milton Bradley version. Complete with all wooden pieces PLUS ONE EXTRA STARTING BLOCK! I got lucky with my sets and now you can play 7 player Bandu! Does not come with original instructions but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed off the Bandu and Bausack instructions so you can play with variants. And I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve supplied 77 Lima beans in a Baggie for bidding purposes but these are NOT original to the game. The boxes are worn but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s to be expected. They still close properly and aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t torn or have holes in them so that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s good. Shipping is just $11 and includes delivery confirmation!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to save money for a wedding so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling games I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play. Please give my Marketplace a look as well as my trade list. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all for sale and ill beat just about any price in the marketplace. Save on shipping too by buying in bulk! Help me help you! </notes>

    <notes>English/French/German deluxe Sac Noir edition by Zoch Verlag. Complete and like new. 
This set has 63 black blocks (including black rule block) and 34 red blocks for a total of 97 blocks. It also includes the outer black cloth bag, a smaller inner black cloth bag, original English/French/German rules, a wood and string measuring tool, and the original dried kidney beans. Note the kind and number of pieces can vary slightly between Sac Noir sets. Some have reported as few as 80 blocks, and 97 seems to be a common good number. Compare with Bandu sets which have around 54 pieces and Bausack sets have around 70 pieces. Also, Sac Noir sets have more challenging block shapes than either.</notes>

    <notes>Bausack: Sac Noir 
Long OOP. This copy has never been played, but has sat collecting dust for a long time. As you can see from the image of the bag, there is a fair amount of collected dust etc... The bag has been opened perhaps 3 times and put back, but never actually used.
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way. I will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.</notes>

    <notes>Hi!  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a Like New copy of Bausack: Sac Noir.  It includes all pieces (as randomly placed in every bag) the instructions and original betting beans.  That is--it includes everything.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it one time, and after sitting on my shelf for too long, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to clean house a bit.  
At time of posting, based on my review of what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s currently available--this is the best, nicest and CHEAPEST copy of Sac Noir available on the ENTIRE INTERNET.
I will ship buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s preference (USPS, UPS and FedEx) at Buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense from 54913.

    <notes>Please be familiar with the various versions of this game.
This is a more than complete copy of Sac Noir (Red and Black, 106 unique pieces (usually 97 pieces)). I am also including a copy of Bandu (No box, 46 of the 48 pieces normally in the set). All stored in the Sac Noir Black bag.
This is a very nice set, though it will be heavy to ship.
Buyer to pay shipping and paypal fees. Contact me before purchasing from outside the USA as this will be difficult to ship at a reasonable rate.

    <notes>This is the Zoch edition in the white linen bag. The components have never been out of the bag. The game has been sitting on our shelf, so even though it is in great shape I would probably wash the bag - I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to do that before I sold it because some people are particular about how they would want to freshen up the sack. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>This set includes BAUSACK AND BANDU. 
I bought both sets and kept it all in the Bausack box. That means there are even more blocks than the original Bausack. 
I did this to allow 2-3 more players to join in the game without running out of blocks. 
ALL of the pieces for Bausack are accounted for. There are TWO missing pieces for Bandu that were already missing when I bought the game secondhand a couple years back.  
From a pet, smoke, and child-free home.
Buyer agrees to pay by Paypal, cover any PayPal fees, and pays for shipping.
No returns after sell. 
Photos available below. 
Feel free to message me with any questions/offers.
Shipping from zip code: 90034

    <notes>This is the Sac Noir Limited Edition with black and red pieces rather than the usual red and beige.
Unplayed and all pieces in perfect condition. No box as it was only ever sold in the bag. Has the small bag inside with the rules (5 variants), measuring pieces (for one of the variants), beans for the bidding.
The contents are listed as the Sac Noir version containing around 100 pieces, but this one actually has 120.
Shipping to U.K. only by Hermes will be around £6.</notes>
