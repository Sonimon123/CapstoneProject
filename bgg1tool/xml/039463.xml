   <description>From the Manufacturer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.  Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.  This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Cosmic Encounter, each player is the leader of an alien race. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense.  The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet.  The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials.  He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card.  The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG CE01)
Build a galactic empire…
In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.
Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy. Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.
This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more. It features 50 alien races, flare cards to boost their powers, 100 plastic ships, a host of premium components, and all-new tech cards that let players research and build extraordinary technological marvels!
No two games are the same!

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG CE01)
Build a galactic empire…
In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.
Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy. Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.
This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more. It features 50 alien races, flare cards to boost their powers, 100 plastic ships, a host of premium components, and all-new tech cards that let players research and build extraordinary technological marvels!
No two games are the same!

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £4.99 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £3.49. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.
Barry

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG CE01)
Build a galactic empire…
In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.
Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy. Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock.
This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more. It features 50 alien races, flare cards to boost their powers, 100 plastic ships, a host of premium components, and all-new tech cards that let players research and build extraordinary technological marvels!
No two games are the same!

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGCE01)
Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp. Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy. Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock. This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more. It features 50 alien races, flare cards to boost their powers, 100 plastic ships, a host of premium components, and all-new tech cards that let players research and build extraordinary technological marvels! No two games are the same! </notes>

    <notes>Perfect condition, hand-made tuck boxes for everything, bonus laminated reference materials.  Does not include original box insert.  Please be sure to check out two expansions for this game that I am selling as well.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail.  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal.  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £4.99 for this item. 
There is the option of first class post and faster courier may be available if required.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>FFG 2011 edition.
The game has been opened, punched, and bagged but is unplayed. Unfortunately the box lide incurred a small ding during shipping. I plan to upload a pic to my BGG gallery (geekmail if interested and I will do this ASAP).  
I will ship using USPS Priority for $11.30, unless you buy multiple games, in which case I will combine shipping and probably use UPS. Local pickup available from zip 90503.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGCE01)
Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe. Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp. Players choose from dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power to further its efforts to build an empire that spans the galaxy. Many classic aliens from earlier editions of this beloved game return, such as the Oracle, the Loser, and the Clone. Newly discovered aliens also join the fray, including Remora, Mite, and Tick-Tock. This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more. It features 50 alien races, flare cards to boost their powers, 100 plastic ships, a host of premium components, and all-new tech cards that let players research and build extraordinary technological marvels! No two games are the same! </notes>

Postal Charges are determined by the weight of the item(s) so if you want to buy more than one game we will work out the postal charges based on the combined weight (which could add to your savings).
Post within the UK for Cosmic Encounter:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 4-7 Day Delivery = £4.99
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 2-3 Day Delivery = £8.35
We also offer a Collect+ Service (for £3.99 for order up to 10kg - typically 3 or 4 games!!) to most areas - in which we send your parcel to one of your local shops that act as a collection centre for this service.  You simply have to pick up your parcel within 10 days of receiving a message telling you it awaits collection (typically within 3-5 days of dispatch).  We can tell you more if you are interested.
Strategy Board _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Card Games is just one of the sections of our online shop that are designed to challenge you to ThinkSomeMore - so you can rest assured you are going to receive a quality product, carefully packaged and dispatched at a great price - from professional service.
Postal Charges to other countries within the EU will be quoted upon request. Typically, there is an additional charge of £3.00 or £4.00</notes>

Edit (8/9/2015):  At request, I added a few pictures of the components.  Everything has been punched out and the cards opened up, but neither the cardboard pieces nor the cards have been worn.  I tried to show the extent to which the box has wear but, I apologize, the lighting in the pictures is not great.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGCE01)
Build a galactic empire... In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe.

    <notes>THIS ADVERT IS FOR A FOAM BOX INSERT, NOT THE GAME ITSELF.
IT CAN FIT THE BASE GAME + UP TO 5 EXPANSIONS, with the following caveats:
A) UN-SLEEVED CARDS + 8 ship colours + tokens can fit (may need to bag 1 ship colour) 
B) SLEEVED CARDS:  
- Will lose one bay for 1 ship colour + tokens to use for cards (IF all 5 expansions + cards sleeved)
- Mayday brand (Chimera size sleeves) will fit - but note these are NOT the premium sleeves, so sleeved cards will NOT all fit with thick sleeves

    <notes>New to selling on board game geek. Help!!!!! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m culling my collection. This game was opened and played once and then just sat on my shelf. I was going to put like new, but the bottom box lid is split at edge (easily fixed with glue). The components are in beyond excellent condition. Buyer pays priority mail shipping. If resides in Seattle/Tacoma, WA area, can make arrangements for pick up.</notes>

This copy of the game includes the first five expansions (not the newly release eons expansion) packed into the original box. This means I can offer shipping for just $9.90 anywhere in the continental US. Except for minor corner wear the game is in once-played condition. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete. There is some wear on the edges and corners of the box as well as the instruction manual. There is no crushing on the box, though. There is a SKU sticker on the barcode of the box. This version is dated 2008. However, I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been able to discern the difference between this and the 2011 version. If the difference between the two matters to you, please contact me prior to purchase to help me figure out for certain which version I have for sure. This would make a great addition to any collection! Offers welcome!</notes>

    <notes>Box has just a little bit of shelf wear, and components are in like-new condition. Missing 1 cosmic token, which you would never notice when playing, as the game comes with far more than you need. 
I also have a like-new copy Cosmic Eons expansions that I can add in for $15.
Buyer pays $13 shipping (possibly cheaper if you live close to 19711).</notes>
