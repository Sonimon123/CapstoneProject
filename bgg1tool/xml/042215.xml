   <description>Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps. During the game, more and more information about the locations of the treasures are revealed, and the possible locations are narrowed down. When a player identifies the location of one of the treasures, they try to reach it as fast as possible to secure the findings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game features a modular game board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Game Description: 
This is where the adventure begins!
Chests full of gold are buried in the jungle - rumors have it that one of them is hidden next to a hut near the island’s largest mountain. Another is hidden where the roar of an untamed river can be heard, it is said. Through the fronds of a palm tree, the proud gaze of a mysteriously scrunching statue casts its spell on the unwary treasure hunter...
Welcome to Tobago!
The attractive, top-quality game pieces on the lovingly illustrated game board give the impression of a true mysterious treasure island. Each player contributes valuable clues, which determine where the treasures are located. The excitement mounts as the adventurers strive to be the first to arrive at the treasure sites. The 3-piece game board with its innovative design can be set up with 32 different scenarios, each providing fun and a new challenge.

Game Description: 
This is where the adventure begins!
Chests full of gold are buried in the jungle - rumors have it that one of them is hidden next to a hut near the island’s largest mountain. Another is hidden where the roar of an untamed river can be heard, it is said. Through the fronds of a palm tree, the proud gaze of a mysteriously scrunching statue casts its spell on the unwary treasure hunter...
Welcome to Tobago!
The attractive, top-quality game pieces on the lovingly illustrated game board give the impression of a true mysterious treasure island. Each player contributes valuable clues, which determine where the treasures are located. The excitement mounts as the adventurers strive to be the first to arrive at the treasure sites. The 3-piece game board with its innovative design can be set up with 32 different scenarios, each providing fun and a new challenge.
Errata!
The rules indicate there are 21 Amulets - there are only 20 - the rules are incorrect.</notes>

Game Description: 
This is where the adventure begins!
Chests full of gold are buried in the jungle - rumors have it that one of them is hidden next to a hut near the island’s largest mountain. Another is hidden where the roar of an untamed river can be heard, it is said. Through the fronds of a palm tree, the proud gaze of a mysteriously scrunching statue casts its spell on the unwary treasure hunter... 
Welcome to Tobago!
The attractive, top-quality game pieces on the lovingly illustrated game board give the impression of a true mysterious treasure island. Each player contributes valuable clues, which determine where the treasures are located. The excitement mounts as the adventurers strive to be the first to arrive at the treasure sites. The 3-piece game board with its innovative design can be set up with 32 different scenarios, each providing fun and a new challenge.

    <notes>English Rio Grande Games edition.
See pics for some relatively minor box damage.  I had received this game 2nd hand in a math trade and it came this way.  Probably got dropped and hit something on the edge.
Otherwise rest of box is in very good or better condition, as are the components.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if this game came with an insert but there is no insert now (and not needed as I have everything nicely bagged, except for the large game board pieces of course).
Also included are copies of the double sided player aid from BGG.</notes>

    <notes>The Game Master - Tobago
Language: Dutch
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 10+
Duration: about 60 min
Weight: 1.230 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: This is where the adventure begins! Chests full of gold are buried in the jungle – rumors have it that one of them is hidden next to a hut near the island’s largest mountain. Another is hidden where the roar of an untamed river can be heard, it is said. Through the fronds of a palm tree, the proud gaze of a mysteriously scrunching statue casts its spell on the unwary treasure hunter… Welcome to Tobago! The attractive, top-quality game pieces on the lovingly illustrated game board give the impression of a true mysterious treasure island. Each player contributes valuable clues, which determine where the treasures are located. The excitement mounts as the adventurers strive to be the first to arrive at the treasure sites. The 3-piece game board with its innovative design can be set up with 32 different scenarios, each providing fun and a new challenge.

    <notes>Tobago by Rio Grande Games - Complete, and in great condition.
The components in this game are awesome, with plastic trees, jeep meeples, wooden huts, and cool textured stone statues. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played a dozen times or so. The box corners have some shelf wear but the cards, tiles, and other components are in perfect shape.
Ships from 55330, at about 3 pounds.  I can ship USPS parcel select or priority mail, estimated shipping will be in the $6-$12 range.</notes>

    <notes>Played about about 10 times over the years, but now need to clear some out some underplayed games to make some room for others. Everything in like new condition and complete.  The only damage is a slight tear in one of the rules sheets - see picture for details.
Buyer pays $10 for shipping via USPS Priority Mail.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll discount combined shipping if you also buy anything else I have for sale.  If paying by personal check, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll wait 5 business days for check to clear.
