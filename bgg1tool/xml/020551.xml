   <description>Shogun is based on the Wallenstein (first edition) game system. The game is set in the Sengoku period (approx 1467-1573) which ends with the inception of the well-known Tokugawa Shogunate._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is an international edition with language-independent components and five language-dependent rule booklets._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Japan during the Sengoku or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Warring States_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops.  Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points.  To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill.  Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role.  The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately.  Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied.  Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; SHOGUN!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Wallenstein (first edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Shogun is based on the Wallenstein game system. The game is set in the Sengoku period (approx 1467-1573) which ends with the inception of the well-known Tokugawa Shogunate.
The game is an international edition with language-independent components and five language-dependent rule booklets.
Japan during the Sengoku or “Warring States” Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes – SHOGUN!

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my copy of Shogun, as much as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a fan of the game, because I need the shelf space.  
My copy has been played three times (there were multiple copies in my group).  All components are included, and it is in great shape.  It has the original _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;warping_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; player mats (but I have the Rio Grande Games better quality replacements included).  
Adult non-smoker owned.  Thanks for looking!

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG 60451)
Japan during the Sengoku or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Warring States_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately.

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG 60451)
Japan during the Sengoku or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Warring States_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes - SHOGUN!</notes>

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG60451F)
Japan during the Sengoku or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Warring States_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes - SHOGUN! </notes>

Shipping will be actual shipping cost which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing will be $15-20 within the US due to the weight and size. Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes - SHOGUN! </notes>

    <notes>Played once, other than that new (I bought it this month after thinking I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d lost another copy). International edition. You can collect it from me in London or I am willing to post it anywhere for cost of postage. Or fly it to you if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re willing to pay for my flights. You have options, is what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m getting at.</notes>

    <notes>Only played twice. Great game, love the tower! Sadly though never gets to the table with my group so reluctant sale. The box is big and heavy so £9.00 first class postage to UK I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m afraid. Will consider worldwide, let me know if you are interested and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know how much it will cost.

    <notes>This particular copy for sale is the Queen Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; First Edition of Shogun from 2006.  It is a multilingual printing of the game.  However, only the English rules and player aids are present at the moment.  The other languages rules and sheets are somewhere else at the moment.  I can look for them if they are needed.
This copy has been played at most once.  Perhaps half a game.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been a while.  All components (wooden pieces, chits, cards, battle tower, and boards) have been accounted for.  The plastic part of the battle tower is clear plastic.
The rules and player aids shifted during transport and were heavily bent.  For the player aid, it bent near the top of the sheet.  The rules were bent along the side.  They are very much usable and otherwise in good shape.  I got replacements of each from Queen.  They are better, but sill not perfect!
The plastic insert is in good shape, but you can see cracks starting to form around the edges.
This game has been around for quite a while.  There are slight indentations on the game box and game board.  On the game board, there is a slight indentation on the Sun side in the provinces of Shimotsuke and Hitachi.  The box bottom has slight indentations here and there (this game box was usually on the bottom of a large stack of games).  The box top is in almost perfect shape with one corner having a bit of dust or something on it (and not coming off).
This game comes from a non-smoking home.</notes>

    <notes>Great copy of this excellent game.  Only getting rid of it because I ordered the big box version.
This version comes with helpful gold/silver marks on the gameboard for reference during play.  (I will get a picture and attach soon -- helpful for newcomers and looks great).  Priced accordingly.
This box is large and wont fit in a flat rate box, so shipping will likely be more than the normal $13 flat-rate price.</notes>

    <notes>This item is posted as a part of the WargameHQ Shelf Clearing Auction.
The item listed is only for purchase by:
jethro bodine
The price has been set at the winning bid, or Buy It Now, price posted to the auction item comment page.
If you won multiple items, please be sure to add them all to your cart at once and then check out so I can include them in your shipping estimate.
As a reminder:
I will only ship to the addresses within the United States.
I only accept PayPal and payment details will be sent alongside your final invoice.
Your item(s) will ship on the Saturday FOLLOWING verified payment. 
I will provide tracking information for your item and insurance sufficient to cover the final price of the auction on shipped items.
Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.
If you have any special requests, please Geekmail me so we can discuss prior to payment finalization.
Thank you for your purchase and I hope you enjoy your new game(s)!</notes>
