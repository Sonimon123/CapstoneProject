   <description>Warhammer Underworlds is a tactical arena combat game. This is a system designed for balanced, small-scale tactical games that can be played quickly and easily by anyone, but which even experienced players will find challenging to master. The game rules are designed with competitive play in mind; matches can be played in under 45 minutes, on a smaller surface than our larger-scale games, and will be ideal for club or tournament play. And not only that, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll be fully supporting an organized play system for this game, right from day one._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The forces you can use in this game will be drawn from races across the Mortal Realms, including some for factions that have not received any new miniatures since we first ventured into the Age of Sigmar. Each of these sets will be composed of a small band of easy-to-assemble, push-fit miniatures in the style of our single-pose heroes to represent a specific band of warriors from that faction. These are provided in coloured plastic, and clip together, so you can quite literally be playing with them within minutes of opening the box with no glue or paint needed! (Though they do look great painted, and your dice will roll better _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; probably.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is played using unique dice and card decks, and these will, to an extent, be unique to each faction. Both decks of cards used in the game are fully customisable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; meaning you can choose to create all manner of combinations of overlapping abilities to use and objectives to achieve. This can be a really rewarding part of the game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and means that even the same faction can be played in wildly different ways. We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re expecting to see all sorts of combinations tried out at game stores, clubs and in tournaments._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;description from the publisher_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Selling the core box and two releases (Sepulchral Guard and Ironskull_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Boyz).  
Box and all components (cards, mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, counters) are complete and in fantastic condition.  Will fit everything into the core box, nicely packaged.
All mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are assembled, counters are punched and bagged.  Only one mini (Angharad Brightshield) was glued (everyone has trouble assembling that one), all others were just snapped together.
Shipping will be at most $13.65 (flat rate), but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll check for lower rates via priority or regular mail (suspect it could be lower, need your zipcode to check).</notes>

    <notes>This include the base game and all 4 released expansions (Dwarf, Orc, Undead, and Skaven).
Currently the Humans, Chaos, Dwarf and undead are built, while the Orc and Skeven are still on spru.
The Undead are painted very well, the others are not currently painted.
Can ship it all in one box, and expect shipping to be between 10-15.  Will meet for local pickup, or something like BGG Spring.</notes>

    <notes>Get the WHOLE first season at a great price!
This sale includes the base game and all expansions, including the Leader card pack and the second board.  Sleeves for all faction packs are also included.   Also, the tokens have been upgraded to the acrylic Lithco token set.
All was bought new and is in excellent condition.  All cards were sleeved when in play; i.e. when I change out cards to modify my deck, the new card is sleeved and the old card goes to the extras section of my box, without a sleeve.  All models are assembled but unpainted.  They all look good EXCEPT for the Sigmarite _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Bright Shield_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, who, alas, is actually shield-less.  I laid that piece aside when it fell mid-game and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t found it since!   She still has her arm in place, and a custom shield could easily be glued there (I was considering using a Nickel). 
Shoot me a PM if you have any questions.</notes>
