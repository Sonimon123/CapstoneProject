   <description>Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries takes you on a Nordic adventure through Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden as you travel to the great northern cities of Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm. This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Nordic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Although not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 – United Kingdom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 – United Kingdom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Ticket to Ride series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is brand new in shrink! I really wanted one of these so instead of just ordering one I got a whole box to pass on to my fellow geeks!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing these as cheaply as I can without losing money. :)
I currently have 8 of them. US shipping is $14. That is for all the packaging  and will work for USPS priority mail or UPS ground. Your call. USPS is faster, UPS is safer...
I will also ship to Canada if someone wants! Priority mail to Canada is $21.
If you live near Boulder, CO you can certainly pick this up from me and save on shipping!
Please feel free to GM me with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries (English language U.S. edition) -- New in Shrinkwrap!
Have your own new, unopened copy this out of print and hard to find train-themed family game! A great holiday game!
------------------------------------------------
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the process of cleaning out the game cabinet. Look back for more deals later. For open and played games, expect prices below what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay at an online discounter.
Shipping: This is a large game and will cost a bit more to ship. I expect it to ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation for $13.60 (Actual Price), but will quote the shipping price when I confirm the order. I will attempt to get you the cheapest and most efficient shipping possible.
Condition notes: Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries -- New in shrinkwrap! 
All games come from a non-smoking, careful environment. I hope you enjoy owning and playing these games as much as I have.
I accept Paypal or Money Order or Cashiers Check.
I do not accept personal checks because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship your game quickly with that payment method.
Please note: I can only accept USPS Money Orders from new users or users with no trade or marketplace feedback.
Currently only shipping to the U.S. If you are in a foreign country and really want one of these games, contact me and I will try to accommodate you - be aware that international shipping costs may be substantially higher.</notes>

PayPal for payment. USPS for shipment.
If you are outside the U.S., please add 2 percent of the total (to include shipping costs) to cover the extra PayPal fees.</notes>
