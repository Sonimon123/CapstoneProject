   <description>Carson City is a strategic game played in four rounds, and in each one of them, the players choose a character from the seven available that gives certain advantages._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After selecting characters, your cowboys are placed on action track locations that allow you to construct buildings, houses, or roads; claim ground; earn money; or score victory points. When more than one player is on the same location, get ready, it is time for a duel! Roll the dice and see if you are the last one standing and lay claim to the goods!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During the game, you can take various actions that earn you victory points for your plots, pistols (the hired help), and buildings. At the end of the game, your buildings, houses, mountains, and money contribute to your victory points, and the person with the most points wins. So go round up your posse of gunslingers and get ready for some Wild West action in Carson City!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Carson City is a strategic game. The game is played in 4 rounds and in each one of them the players choose a character (there are 7 available) that gives certain advantages, after that cowboys are placed on action fields on the board to build Carson city. Players can claim ground, erect special buildings, houses or construct roads. When there are several players on 1 action field, a duel is fought. During play, money (to construct) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; points can be earned. He who earns most points wins the game.

During play, money (to construct) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; points can be earned. He who earns most points wins the game.

    <notes>The version offered for sale is a **Masterprint Edition**, i.e. with a view of Carson City on the front of the box. The game comes **with the Indian expansion**. The game has been played several times, but has **no marks** on it indicating (heavy) use. Hence the condition **_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;**.
For quotes on **S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H**, contact me via Geekmail. I ship worldwide. Various options are available, ranging from simple uninsured surface mail to high-speed express mail. Of course this will be reflected in the price.
**Payment** depends on where you are located. Within the EU, it is easiest and cheapest to pay via normal bank transfer, as this is fairly quick, secure, and free. Outside the EU PayPal is easiest, though bank transfers are of course still welcome. IBAN and BIC/SWIFT codes are available upon request.
**Questions?** Geekmail is your friend. If the time zone difference isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t too great you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive a prompt and succint answer.</notes>

Carson City is a strategic game. The game is played in 4 rounds and in each one of them the players choose a character (there are 7 available) that gives certain advantages, after that cowboys are placed on action fields on the board to build Carson city. Players can claim ground, erect special buildings, houses or construct roads. When there are several players on 1 action field, a duel is fought. During play, money (to construct) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; points can be earned. He who earns most points wins the game.

(as long as supply lasts)
Prices are including 21% VAT (for shipments outside the EU VAT is not applicable).
Shipping and payment upon agreement. If you email us, we can give you an estimate of the shipping costs, which are pretty good thanks to our central location within Europe (games below 2kg usually between 6-8E). We prefer payment through IBAN, but Paypal with 4% surcharge is also possible.

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101209N)
 Carson City is a strategic game. The game is played in 4 rounds and in each one of them the players choose a character (there are 7 available) that gives certain advantages, after that cowboys are placed on action fields on the board to build Carson city. Players can claim ground, erect special buildings, houses or construct roads. When there are several players on 1 action field, a duel is fought. During play, money (to construct) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; points can be earned. He who earns most points wins the game. </notes>

    <notes>This is for the 1st edition of Carson City AND Carson City: Gold and Guns as well as Carson City: A New Beginning. Everything is stored in the Gold and Guns box, the box for the original base game is not included. The 1st edition box art was hideous anyway, you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want it. :) 
The game has been played a few times but all of the components are in like new condition and the box shows only the tiniest amount of shelf wear. 
Shipping is $10 anywhere in the US.</notes>

    <notes>Carson City Quined Master Print Edition + Carson City: Gold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Guns expansion
Both are in great condition; there is slight whitening on the corners of the base game box, but the components and board are in perfect shape.  I can include the plastic storage container I use for all of the tiles and pieces.
If you are willing to forgo receiving the expansion box (everything fits nicely in base game box), the shipping will be standard USPS Priority 2 Day ($13).  If you would like both boxes, the shipping will most likely be more, or not Priority.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
Check my other listings and my ratings! 
I only accept PayPal (and only goods and services payments).  
Yes, I will do local pickup.  
Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  
Happy shopping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Happy Gaming!</notes>
