   <description>San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;violet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion. This edition also contains a new building card not previously available: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Hut_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, a building that grants a card when nothing is sold in the trader phase._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Ravensburger (RVB81206)
A card game based on Puerto Rico. The pack of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;violet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else. Cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round. This new edition of San Juan contains the additional buildings from the previously available expansion but not the event cards. It also contains a new building not previously available in any version: The Hut. This building grants a card when nothing was sold in the trader phase.</notes>

Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.65 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 8.70
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 10.15
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 13.40
Registered Post: (Including 1.65 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 12.40
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 15.20
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 18.45
Registered post everywhere else. 
Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
3) As a last resort, I also accept Skrill, Payza and Neteller (In that order and buyer pays fees).
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>
