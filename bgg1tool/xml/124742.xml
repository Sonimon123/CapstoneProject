   <description>Welcome to New Angeles, home of the Beanstalk. From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming. We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards. </notes>

    <notes>Opened and punched and had one aborted first play.  Everything is included and appears untouched.  Game seems really good, but also highly complex.  A bit beyond what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m used to in card games of this caliber.  Give it a good home!
Shipping will be by USPS Priority Mail Medium Flat Rate Box unless buyer specifies otherwise.  You can also pick the item up from me if you live near New Smyrna Beach, FL.</notes>

    <notes>I will send this game to the eventual buyer using the Collect Plus courier service. It will be tracked and needs to be signed for upon receipt. Details can be found at www.collectplus.co.uk.
Post and packing costs will be:
£6.00 delivered to your door, OR
£4.50 delivered to your nearest participating dealer for you to collect. (I recommend this as you do not have wait in for delivery. An email is sent when it is ready to be collected.)
The above postage costs refer to Mainland UK. Postage to other UK destinations will have to be on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;as is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; basis.
Postage to Mainland Europe is far more than the game is worth. About £35.00. If you are desperate to buy it I will inform you of the costs involved.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards. </notes>

    <notes>This listing is for (i) two complete, gently used copies of the Android: Netrunner LCG core set and (ii) one brand new, never opened copy of the What Lies Ahead data pack (the first expansion for the game):
    Two (2) complete core sets - You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get everything contained in two core sets, although I plan to consolidate all of the contents into a single core set box (I can ship you the second empty box, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll add an additional ~$10 or so in packaging and shipping costs; contact me if interested). This means that you get two sets of all the core set cards (in essentially mint condition; only used for a few games and cards were always sleeved when being played), two sets of all the markers (one set punched, one set unpunched) and a single core set box.
    One (1) copy of the What Lies Ahead data pack for the Android Netrunner LCG game. This data pack is brand new and sealed.
All items come from a non-smoking, no pet home and were adult owned.
Please note that these items ship for FREE within Australia; shipping outside Australia is NOT available. Local pick-up is also available in the Sydney CBD.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
 Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards.</notes>

    <notes>This is for one core set and a complete set of the genesis cycle.  Many cards have never been played, but all are out of package and original package is missing (including the core-set box).  
So one of:
Core Set
A Study in Static
Cyber Exodous
Future Proof
Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow
Trace Amount
What Lies Ahead
All cards come in card sheets in a 3-ring binder (organized by type and faction).  Also included are all tokens and the rulebook.  Buyer pays actual shipping.  If you want a quote my zip is 34604, but I believe I can fit this in a medium flat-rate box.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like another shipping method I am flexible.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards. </notes>

In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards. </notes>

    <notes>This is a listing for Android Netrunner LCG base game. Honestly it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just been sitting on my shelf for six months now, and I could really use the space. It needs someone to love it and I just can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find anyone to be motivated enough to either teach me or to learn with me. All cards are sleeved and sorted. Good condition box and cards (minor scuffs on box where other boxes were sliding against it and a couple sleeves have minor bends from forgotten rubber band, but cards were undamaged. Comes with instructions and all game pieces.
Shipping is flat rate USPS. Please feel free to contact with any questions. Thank you.</notes>

    <notes>Cards only ever played sleeved. Many cards never played and in Like New condition. Since all cards played sleeved, they are effectively in Like New condition, but I have listed this at Very Good to be fair.
Includes 2 core sets, all Genesis-cycle data packs (1 each), and Creation and Control. Includes all tokens from both sets and 2 core rulebooks. MSRP $200. CoolStuffInc price: $130.
Sleeves not included.
Cards are organized into a card box which is ~50% full based on the above list of cards.
Paypal from verified buyers only. Buyer to pay actual shipping costs. At buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s option, cards can be repacked into 2 core boxes (in excellent condition) and those boxes can be shipped instead of the card box I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m currently using. C_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;C box can be included if choosing this option. Shipping from ZIP 48911 via Buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s choice of UPS or Priority Mail. 
Additional promos not included, but available (Melange, Scorched Earth, Season 2 playmat) for additional cost. For all questions or other offers please GM me.</notes>

    <notes>Have finally decided to let go of my Android Netrunner collection--an amazing game, but I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time to keep up with the ever evolving meta unfortunately. In this instance, my loss is your gain! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my collection as a single bundle, which includes all of the cards from:
Core Set x3
Creation and Control
1) The Genesis Cycle:
•What Lies Ahead 
•Trace Amount 
•Cyber Exodus 
•A Study in Static 
•Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow 
•Future Proof 
 
2) The Spin Cycle: 
•Opening Moves 
•Second Thoughts 
Also included are all of the tokens from the three core sets--everything will ship inside a single core set box. All of the cards are in great condition--they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only ever been used in sleeves by an adult in a non-smoking, no pet home.
These cards would normally run you in the vacinity of $175 if you bought from an online discount retailer--I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $130 and that includes free shipping to the continental United States. Plus, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be doing a fellow gamer a favor... and funding my X-Wing obsession :)

Missing the insert in the cardboard box - otherwise everything is completely and in great condition.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened the box and played two games. Unfortunately, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a deeper game than I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d hoped, so it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t suit my gaming opportunities. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a great game (but you know that already, right?), I just won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any opportunities to play it.
All of the contents are in perfect condition, I always take very good care of my possessions. All of the small components have been sorted into a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;weekly pill box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, denying you the opportunity to pop out the components yourself. To compensate for this small loss in personal satisfaction, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing for $35 for what is essentially a brand new product.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d much prefer not to deal with shipping if at all possible, so if you would be available to meet in NSW post codes 2204, 2113 or 2000 then get in touch and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll work something out.</notes>

http://www.magicmadhouse.co.uk/accessories-c1132/standard-size-sleeves-c1137/plain-raven-black-sleeves-50-p42768
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure on the total amount, but I have these currently protecting the following:
1 Core Set,
What lies ahead,
Trace amount,
Cyber exodus,
A study in static,
Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shadow,
Future proof,
Opening moves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;
Double time.
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are also a number of sleeve spare, maybe 50 black and 25 blue.
The reason for selling is that the game doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get played as much as I had anticipated and sleeving the cards isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t nessecary.
Cheers

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards.</notes>

    <notes>Hello,
I am selling my Android: Netrunner collection. Included in this auction are the following:
Core
Android: Netrunner Core Set
Honor and Profit Deluxe Expansion
Creation and Control Deluxe Expansion
Data Packs
What Lies Ahead
Trace Amount
Cyber Exodus
A Study in Static
Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow
Future Proof
Opening Moves
Second Thoughts
Mala Tempora
True Colors
Fear and Loathing
Double Time
Upstalk
The Spaces Between
First Contact
Please note that I also have 3 copies of each 1 of and 2 of from the Core Set. That means you are getting 3 copies of every card released for the game so far. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting a fully competitive collection with this. In addition, I have every card sleeved in Ultra Pro Matte Sleeves. With Runners being in red, and Corporations in Blue. I have never played a game without my cards sleeved, this goes with all of my games. I have also only played about 5 games of Netrunner unfortunately because the community just hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t kicked off the ground as I thought it would have for various reasons, including myself partially. This means barely any of the cards have ever been touched. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting an amazing deal with this selling, as the sleeves themselves aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t that cheap, especially for this many cards! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give this auction about 1 week, so this will end at 7:00 p.m. CDT on October 1st, 2014. To ship all of this domestic USA will be around $25-30, of which the buyer will pay. I will ship international, buyer will pay. I will only sell through PayPal and this will go through BGG Marketplace. The minimum bid for the items (shipping not included) is $150 to start off, as I know even with online prices all of this is worth more than $150. Please contact me if you have any questions, thank you and happy bidding!</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGADN01)
Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. In a world where corporations can scan the human mind and interface it directly with electronic data, more data moves every second than was ever processed in the first five-thousand years of written language. The network is omnipresent, the crux of modern human civilization, and while visionary corporations seek to secure their most valuable data on the network, the elite hackers known as netrunners seek to steal it. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment. The Android: Netrunner Core Set features 252 cards, including seven unique identity cards.</notes>

    <notes>This is a sale for the following:
 
(£25) 1 x Base Game
(£25) 1 x all rare Base Game cards (so you have 3 of everything which comes in quantities of 2 or 3 in base unit, and 2 of each 1/base set card)
(£60) All 6 Expansions for Spin Cycle (No Boxes)
(£60) All 6 Expansions for Genesis Cycle (No Boxes)
(£20) 1 x Creation and Control (No Box)
(£20) 1 x Honor and Profit (No Box)
(£20) All cards sleeved in Ultra-Pro sleeves.
(£15) Two Ultra-Pro Plastic Deck Boxes
 
So in short, it’s two base sets plus the first 14 (12 small, 2 large) expansions with everything sleeved in red/blue Ultra-Pro sleeves.  It’s about ~£250 worth of stuff.  Of course, it’s all in a single standard game box; so that’s nice for storage.
 
It’s a great set to have – the base set is a bit light on options in my opinion; so having the expansions really gives you lots of flexibility.
 
Regards condition – the cards have been sleeved from the moment that I bought them, so they are perfect.  The box is in pretty good shape, and the deck-boxes are in excellent shape indeed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m simply not getting the time to keep up with Netrunner, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m bailing.  This would make an awesome set for someone joining the NetRunner party right now - lots of options and a decent saving over the individual cost.</notes>

I love this game but I have to part with it due to lack of play. Closest place to find players is the game store an hour away. Nobody in my game group got into it. Has only been played half a dozen times. 
Shipping is free.</notes>

    <notes>This includes 3 core sets and all Data packs from the Genesis Cycle, Spin Cycle, and Lunar Cycle as well as The Valley. I also have an extra copy of the first four expansions (what lies ahead, trace amount, cyber exodus, and a study in static). There are also various cards that i gained through a couple drafts. Also included are a number of promo cards and a pair of playmats listed below. I do not have any of the original boxes and while the cards saw plenty of play, they are in excellent condition since I sleeved them when they were in a deck.
Promo cards
adonis campaign x5
aesop_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pawnshop x3
HB engineering the future x1
jinteki personal evolution x1
kati jones x2
melange mining corp x1
plascrete carapace x4
pop up window x3
scorched earth x5
weyland building a better world x1
wyldside x4
 
Playmats
2013 season three champion (project vitruvius)
2014 season one champion (honor and profit box art)
Shipping will likely be around $25 due to the weight of the cards.</notes>

    <notes>Great game, but I never get to play it since daughter came along--not that it saw that much use as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have liked, to be honest--so sadly putting it up for sale.
Two copies of the core set, including the entire first cycle (Genesis) and Creation and Control.
As it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seen that much use, the cards are in good condition with very little wear and tear.  However, they were never (and are not) sleeved.  The box has a slight scuff along one corner.  
One of the packs in the first cycle is a double, though I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember which one--a purchasing error online.
A great way into the game!
For a London-based purchase, may be able to hand over in person, especially at LoB or at Croydon Board Gamers.</notes>

    <notes>All the cards from the base set, plus all the expansions so far, up to and including Chrome City.
All cards are near mint (only a handful were played once and they were sleeved).
There are three copies of the base set included in this lot.
Two promo Runner identities (see photo).
All tokens included.
Box slightly damaged on one side (see picture).
Will most likely throw in 100 blue and 100 red sleeves as well at no extra cost.
Also included are three playmats (what looks like dust or spots on the red and blue mats is part of the design).
Shipping to the UK included. I might consider shipping to other locations but bear in mind this will be a heavy package. And of course, shipping will not be free to other locations.
Would prefer bank transfer but will consider PayPal as well.
Note: the wooden insert is not included in this lot.
Any questions, please ask.</notes>

    <notes>Hi everyone - here I have for sale my Android: Netrunner collection. Finally realised I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keep up with all my LCGs so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to let one go. Here is everything you need for a fantastic head start in this amazing game:
2x Android: Netrunner Core Sets
1x Full Genesis Cycle 
 - What Lies Ahead
 - Trace Amount
 - Cyber Exodus
 - A Study in Static
 - Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow
 - Future Proof
1x Creation _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Control (1st deluxe expansion)
1x Opening Moves (Spin Cycle)
1x Second Thoughts (Spin Cycle)
1x Upstalk (Lunar Cycle)
1x The Source (Lunar Cycle)

That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s around 400 individual cards with three copies of each (aside from some core set cards which are x2 as only 1 was included in each set): more than enough to get you building competitive decks. Included will also be a significant number of Blue and Green Fantasy Flight card sleeves to protect your cards, at least 300 at last count but probably more.
Postage within the UK will be included - for Europe, contact me for a quote.

    <notes>My entire Android: Netrunner collection, which includes:
 - One core set
 - One copy of each Genesis Cycle data pack (What Lies Ahead, Trace Amount, Cyber Exodus, A Study in Static, Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow, Future Proof)
 - One copy of each Spin Cycle data pack (Opening Moves, Second Thoughts, Mala Tempora, True Colors, Fear and Loathing, Double Time)

Local pick-up available in Kew Gardens, Queens NY. 
You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
International orders require insurance which is usually only $2-3 extra to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

The BGG condition policy is a little confusing. All cards are in excellent condition. I have removed them from the original boxes, sorted them into their factions and types (see pic), created a few decks, and played several times before I realized that I am just not any good at this game and more packs weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t going to help me. :-P  All cards were sleeved when played. 
Retail was $360, but *all offers will be considered*. 
Will accept cash if picked up in person in Houston, TX.

    <notes>Selling my entire Netrunner collection. I LOVE this game, took great care of the cards and even built my own insert system within the box to organize everything. Sadly, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time anymore to engage in the meta like I used to. This is a great set and honestly I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a bit sad to see it go.
This sale includes 2 Core Sets, Creation _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Control, Honor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Profit, all of the Genesis, Spin, and Lunar cycles, except for the last data pack in Lunar. Also included are enough UltraPro clear sleeves for 4+ decks.
It all fits inside of a single core set box with a custom cardboard insert that I built to hold everything. Boxes for the deluxe expansions will not be included unless requested.
Retail for this was roughly $350, willing to consider all offers.
This is a pretty hefty purchase, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to answer further questions via Google chat or Hangout, message me your contact info.
Will accept cash if picked up in person in Brooklyn, NY.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m looking to sell my netrunner collection. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got all the tokens, most of the boxes (missing ones are mentioned), and all cards are in penny sleeves, sorted by faction and type. All together, these cards retail for over $400 + tx. Save some money and get them from me! Also willing to sell the expansions as a set without the Core set for $220. 
Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what I have. 
Android: Netrunner Core set 
Deluxe expansions: 
Android: Netrunner – Creation and Control (missing box) 
Android: Netrunner – Honor and Profit 
Android: Netrunner – Order and Chaos 
Android: Netrunner – Data and Destiny 
Data Packs: 
-Genesis Cycle- 
Android: Netrunner – What Lies Ahead (missing box) 
Android: Netrunner – Trace Amount 
Android: Netrunner – Cyber Exodus 
Android: Netrunner – A Study in Static 
Android: Netrunner – Humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow 
-Spin Cycle- 
Android: Netrunner – Opening Moves x2 
Android: Netrunner – Second Thoughts 
Android: Netrunner – True Colors 
Android: Netrunner – Fear and Loathing 
Android: Netrunner – Double Time 
-Lunar Cycle- 
Android: Netrunner – The Spaces Between 
Android: Netrunner – First Contact 
Android: Netrunner – Up and Over 
The cards have barely been played. I like collecting them, and I love the game and art, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just not into deck building.</notes>

 I usually get the package in the post the day after purchase. I must emphasise that I take extra care to package in a sturdy box with packing protection, however I accept no responsibility for the package once it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the hands of Auspost. If you have a wild postal contractor who likes to hurl boxes AFL style at your front door then please let me know to organise signature on delivery. (Likewise if you live in a building where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not prepared to take the risk of Auspost leaving a parcel at the front door.) No refunds for damage or loss in transit - please take it up with Auspost - I will be happy to provide a copy of the receipt for your claim. All parcels come with a tracking number. If you require extra insurance then let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll arrange it. 
Local pickup in St Ives is available.</notes>

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - Netrunner - has been unwrapped, opened, and only played once. The box has few tiny scuff marks, though. Basically, this means that the condition of the game is indeed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new / very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/chidentity ...</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete play set, tournament ready.
3x core sets with counters
All four deluxe expansions - Creation _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Control, Honor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Profit, Order _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Chaos, Data _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Destiny
All datapacks from What Lies Ahead through 23 Seconds
Promo cards: Ice Wall, 2x Howard Jackson, Political Operative
Silhouette playmat
All cards except one core set are kept in Ultra Pro 9 pocket side loading binder pages.  The cards are arranged into sections by release cycle three card per sleeve, one 4 inch binder for corp and one for runner.
Four decks are sleeved in clear sleeves, with extra sleeves for at least 2 more decks.  Two decks are in ultra pro clear sleeves, the rest are Fantasy Flight clear sleeves.
Everything listed is included.  
When I moved to binders, I only kept one core box.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want the binders and pages, we can talk about leaving them out and adjusting the price.
If you want to pay by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear before shipping.
I am happy to email photos, send a PM with your email address.  If you want photos of specific cards, be sure to let me know.</notes>

    <notes>Hi there!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my small Netrunner collection. I generally bought the packs as recommended by the r/netrunner buying guide, so perhaps have quite a beginner friendly collection of data packs. I have the following:
Core Set (x1)
Deluxe Expansions
---
Creation _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Control
Order _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Chaos
Data _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Destiny
Data Packs
---
Opening Moves
What Lies Ahead
Cyber Exodus
Future Proof
True Colours
Double Time
Old Hollywood
Chrome City
I also have 100x UltraPro 9-Pocket Pages that I can throw in.
RRP ~£190
Selling for £95 (+P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P / PayPal 3%)
Happy to meet up if desired (I live and work in London). Can refer to other BGG users I have sold to/provide eBay feedback on request.
Many thanks,
Jason</notes>

    <notes>This game is in VERY good condition.  Played about 6 times.  This game will ship by medium flate rate box (unless I can find you significant savings) within 3 days of payment.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the solid starter pack and expansions can be found cheap.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good game. I just could not convert enough Magic: The Gathering or boardgame players to make it worth keeping.  There is an interesting bluffing component to this game that I really enjoy though.</notes>

    <notes>One of those _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;thought I would play but didnt end up playing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
In this sale I am including:
1) 2x entire base game
2) I believe most of the expansions all the way to The Universe of Tomorrow. I was missing perhaps 3-4 of them, not sure. I can check for specific cards if you are wondering.
3) All 4 Deluxe Expansions
The picture probably gives a better idea of how many cards this represents (it fills an entire game box). Link below.
I am setting the price rather low as I really wish to part from this soon since its been collecting dust since early 2016.

    <notes>The game is like new and had not been played. 
I will ship in USA using USPS. Do not ask for a shipping estimate. I am not making two trips to the post office. I will send it as cheaply as possible. It will likely be between $7-15 dollars depending on size and weight.
I am selling this along with two other Netrunner expansions (Honor and Profit and Creation and Control - both are like new and are worth about $20-$15). Make me an offer ($10 each firm) and maybe we can make a deal.
I will send elsewhere to the world, but do not expect the shipping to be cheap. Sending things to the Pacific seems to be more expensive than Europe.
Note: If you make an order and do not pay me and then fail to contact me as to why you have not paid me, I will give you a negative rating. I am taking the time to go to the post office and get you an estimate. I am sending the game as cheaply as possible. Please be an honest buyer.</notes>

- All data packs up to escalation in Flashpoint cycle
- 2 copies of Kati Jones alternate art promo.
- All cards are sleeved (clear sleeves), and were always played this way
- I kept the 2 core boxes, and 1 deluxe expansion boxes.
- Play mat from the 2014 store championship
This is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;$600 in MSRP.  I separated the cards by data packs/expansions. Condition of game components is great. One core box is showing its age from me taking it places and from sitting on the shelf now that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been playing other things.
PM me with any questions.</notes>

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my collection as a whole. The collection was only lightly played (many of the cards were unplayed) and then only in sleeves so the cards are in great shape. The only original packaging left is the two core boxes which I used to store the cards in, plus the two data packs from the SanSan cycle which are unopened. I have two copies of the core set, 2 copies of the deluxe expansion Creation and Control, the deluxe expansion Honor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Profit as well as the Genesys cycle, Spin cycle and Lunar cycle data packs, plus the above mentioned 2 data packs from SanSan cycle - The Valley and Breaker Bay. Except for the two unopened data packs, all the cards are mixed together, sorted by type. Shipping is additional. It weighs 12 lbs and ships from 20705.</notes>

    <notes>Includes at least (honestly probably more than) 3 original core sets
First two cycles (Spin and Genesis)  -- This is the equivalent of 3 revised core sets, and the cards are already separated so the cards no longer legal for tournament play are in a different spot.  In pricing I just counted this as 3 cores not two cycles and 3 cores
As well as the 4 main deluxe boxes (Honor and profit, order and chaos, creation and control, data and destiny)
And terminal directive player cards.
I still have one of the original core set boxes, that plus long boxes will store the cards to ship.  
Shipping is included in price to USA or Canada.</notes>

    <notes>I sell the complete collection of Android Netrunner LCG, with everything that has come out to date plus several extras. I do not want to sell it in parts or separate part of the extras, it is sold as a complete pack.
- 3 copies of all the basic cards (3 original cores were bought and I kept 3 cards of each card, which is the legal maximum, except for some cards that have more than 3 copies).
- All the cycles and expansions that have come out, (genesis, spin, lunar, sansan, mumbad, flashpoint, red sands, creation and control, honor and profit, order and chaos and data and destiny)
- About Kitara, I have the adventures 1,2,3 and 5. These packs are unopened.
- It also includes the player cards of the legacy expansion (Terminal Directive). The expansion is already played, but player cards are included.
- World Champion decks cards, with exclusive art from 2015 (runner and corp) and 2016 (runner and corp).
- Several promotional cards, with exclusive art. From this, I do not have a list. The originals were always kept.
- Original FFG _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Masque_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; playmat, unopened.
- Methacrylate tokens that replace the cardboard originals.
- I add two UltraPro Collectors Album ring binders for the storage of the cards with UltraPro Platinum sheets (all the cards are sent already organized in the albums).
- The only thing that I do not have are the boxes and rulebooks of the cores and expansions, nor the original cardboard tokens (I replaced them with methacrylate tokens).
The cards are in a very good condition and were always played sleeved. I also give away about 200 blue and red Dragon Shield sleeves. The cards are unsleeved on the binders.
Comes from a non-smoking home. 
For shipping options, the buyer pays the cost and he/she can choose from several options. If you are interested please ask me and i will give you an estimate depending of where you live.</notes>

Only played a few times. All cards were played in sleeves and are in pristine condition.
All cards are organized in 9 per page card organizers in several binders (by organization and card type). I still have the boxes for the larger expansions, if you want them. The smaller deck sized boxes are not available.
Forgetting the binders and the organization, all this would cost you $251 from coolstuffinc, and similar prices from other online games stores.

    <notes>I am selling my Android Netrunner collection, which runs through the Honor and Profit deluxe expansion.  For most of the cards, I have sleeved them in notebooks, one for the runner and one for the corporation.  This item also includes 2 deck boxes and un-used card sleeves.
Please geek mail me if you would like photos or have questions about the game.
Buyer will pay shipping and packaging costs (not my time, but the box and bubble wrap). If you have a shipping preference, geek mail me and let me know.
Also, I live in the 21209 zip code (Baltimore, MD), so let me know if you would prefer to pickup the game and save us both time on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Like new, I used some of the cardboard in the original packaging to create a card and counter box. The carry box closes securely with velcro and fits inside the larger box. I played this game once or twice- ended up spending more time sorting the cards than actually playing.</notes>

The first three complete cycles, totaling 18 datapacks (Genesis, Spin, Lunar)

Essentially, this is everything except the last five cycles (30 datapacks) and the final incoming deluxe expansion.
