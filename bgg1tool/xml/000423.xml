   <description>This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on an map of eastern Canada. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game features the formation of the Canadian Government Railroad, and government loans as well as major obstacles for railroad growth. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player goes bankrupt, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Like new copy.  Only shrink has been removed and parts inventoried.  Never played.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship worldwide, but buyer is responsible for all costs.  You can calculate postage from 68005 if you want.  I prefer USPS but will use a different service on request.  
Bear in mind, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling these for extra cash.  This is not a business for me so it could take a few days to get it in the mail.  If you want it quicker, ask for expedited shipping and handling and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get it out quicker through overnight shipping or something, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cost you.  If you want to pay via any means other than paypal, please contact me first before adding it to your cart and checking out.</notes>

Condition Notes:
Still in shrinkwrap.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

    <notes>Have played this a couple of times.  Am going to be moving to Portland ( I know a fairly large 18XX population in Portland ) and think that I will be only playing 18XX during conventions.
Game is in great condition. Tracks are sperated in color cordinated baggies.
All deep thought games are unmounted board except 1832. We have a board with plexi glass that works great for us.
Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come with cash as our group plays with Pocker Chips.
Shipping well be via USPS Proity Mail. Do combine shipping as well. So if two games would fit in a Medium Flat rate shipper thats the price they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d go out with.  If need to upgrade to a large that is $16. 
Please see my other auctions as well.
1856
1860
1870
18NEB
All with various prices. All the Deep THought Games basically reatail but you can get them NOW rather than 6 months from now.
Of course always will intertain offers.
Also have 1830 Mayfair version, 1835, and 1861 but not really wanting to give them up but would if somebody realy wanted them.
Can provide pictures if interested.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new in shrink, although it was a ding and dent copy.  Box has a very minor dent (image with description below), components are not affected.  Shrink intact. 
$12 shipping.
------damage description------
Looking at the image below, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have a hard time finding the dent.  The picture does show the damage though, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not very big, and is hard to find!  
In the center of the back of the box, you can see the black line dividing the game board image (green, left side of the image) from the text portion (gray, right side).  Follow that black line towards the bottom edge of the box.  On the other side of the UPC barcode, on that black line, you can see the deepest part of the small dent. 
The dent is approximately 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; across, and maybe 1/4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deep.  It really is benign. </notes>

    <notes>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rating only due to box condition - box has slight markings, bows outward slightly on sides of lid, but is structurally very well intact.
Components were only very recently punched, and one game was played, so components are in Like New condition.
Buyer pays shipping.  I will do my best to ship via the cheapest method possible.</notes>
