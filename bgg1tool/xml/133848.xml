   <description>UPDATE July 1, 2014: 16 of the original recruit cards have been updated and revised for the second printing of Euphoria. Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Euphorians aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;especially matching pairs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Official Rules: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;a target='_blank' href=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;https://stonemaiergames.com/games/euphoria/rules/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rel=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nofollow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;https://stonemaiergames.com/games/euphoria/rules/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;/a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Microbadges:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia fan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia fan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Kickstarter Deluxe Edition, still sealed, brand new. Between the campaign and receiving the game, I learned that kiddo and I just simply aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t resource/worker placement gamers. (We apparently like much simpler card games, Ticket to Ride style boards, etc.) I really wanted to open it and see the upgraded metal goodies, etc, but my loss is your gain :)
Also look at my BGG collection to see if there are any trades you may be interested in. Prefer unsealed/new of course, so we are like for like. 
(Also, for some reason sometimes I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get all notifications from BGG so please message me or whatever you can if I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t respond right away. I check email everyday and am fighting Gmail to stop flagging things as spam!)

Alternate Art Box Sleeve
54 realistic resource tokens (upgraded from wood, e.g. clay looks/feels like clay, stone like stone, gold bars are made of metal)
24 extra wood commodity tokens

    <notes>No shipping costs for Germany! This is the retail 1st edition.
All games are new and in their original wrapping and all prices include the German VAT (7% or 19%).
We offer only goods that we have in stock.
We ship worldwide – please ask for a quote about exact shipping costs (rest assured that we always try to keep them as low as possible).
Payment may be made by Paypal or bank transfer in advance.
For orders above €50 we grant a discount of €5 on shipping costs.
If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email (laden@gamers-hq.de), give us a call (+49 30 79706126) or visit our homepage (www.gamers-hq.de).
Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

    <notes>Kickstarter Deluxe Edition, complete and overall in great shape.  Has been played 2-3 times, so it may not be flawless, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been very well taken care of and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no damage or notable wear.  Cards have been sleeved since before the first play (sleeves still included) and the KS exclusive box sleeve was removed and stored separately so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in great condition.  I did add printed errata stickers to one tile and one card, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not overly sticky label paper so they could probably be removed if desired.
USPS shipping will be around $15 depending on where you are (shipping from 85704) and how soon you want it.</notes>

    <notes>English Version in (like) new condition - from a smoke free home
with Kickstarter Deluxe Board
wooden stars and ressources
It is a mix of the German retail and the English Kickstarter Deluxe version.
The Box is German, but all language dependent components are from the English Kickstarter Deluxe Edition (cards, markets, rules - and the double sided fantastic game board).
Only the markets the board and cards were played once (they were sleeved then), the wooden components are new, the cardboard pieces are unpunched.
If you are interested, I could add color printings of the German cards/markets, which can be used if you put the cards in sleeves.
Shipping within Germany 4,50 Euro - please ask for international quotations.
Paypal is possible, but buyer pays fees. bank transfer within EU causes no fees.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but unplayed and unpunched.  The box has a couple of VERY small corner dings (that may even be in the way it was manufactured), and some very light shelfwear on one side the sleeve does not protect.  The sleeve is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;distressed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; the way it is printed, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tough to tell exactly how much wear is really has.  There are a couple of dings on the edge of the sleeve that are clearly not printed in.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter Deluxe Edition of Euphoria. This includes the realistic resources, The extra set of wooden goods tokens, Wooden victory stars, and 4 extra white dice (not sure if that was intentional or an error). 
The game is in excellent condition. The corners of the box sleeve have a little bit of wear, but not noticeable with the overall distressed look of the sleeve. The box itself is in excellent condition. All components are in excellent condition. One electricity token had been broken during manufacturing, so I have a few extras of that token, provided by Stonemaier.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter Deluxe Edition (comes with realistic resource tokens and other component upgrades (see here for details - https://stonemaiergames.com/games/euphoria/whats-in-the-box/ )
Also comes with the updated recruit cards that are present in the 2nd edition.
The box sleeves shows some wear (nothing too terrible, plus it is supposed to look distressed). 
Shipping will be around $13 (medium flat rate box -- the game is pretty heavy so I would expect the cost for priority mail to be similar).</notes>

Limited edition Kickstarter version, complete with realistic resources. Also contains the 16 updated (re-balanced) recruit cards which were bought separately.
Note: one bit of stone was missing when the game arrived. Included in the box now is a realistic but non-matching replacement (supplied by Stonemeier games). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never run out when playing, and they are unlimited in the game (so a precise number isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t vital to the game).
Falls into the overweight category for shipping.</notes>
