As owners of a fantastic steam park, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re to build gigantic, coal-powered rides to attract as many visitors as you can - but building attractions won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be enough. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also need to manage your employees, invest in advertising in order to attract and please the different kinds of guests visiting your park, and, above all, keep the dirt that your park produces under strict control! Steam Park is an easy-to-learn game with two difficulty levels: one for the less experienced gamers and a more strategic one for those who want a more exciting challenge. In this management game, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to build your own amusement park and make it the largest and most profitable in the region. By constructing the three-dimensional, wonderful rides designed by Marie Cardouat, you will see your park grow right before your eyes. Choose your strategy! Build Stands to attract more Visitors, or Toilets to keep the Dirt under control. Whatever decision you take, take it quickly: The less time you spend planning, the more time you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to maintain your park. Thanks to a clever, original action-choosing mechanism, winning in Steam Park is as much a matter of being the best as of being the fastest! </notes>

Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.

As owners of a fantastic steam park, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re to build gigantic, coal-powered rides to attract as many visitors as you can - but building attractions won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be enough. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also need to manage your employees, invest in advertising in order to attract and please the different kinds of guests visiting your park, and, above all, keep the dirt that your park produces under strict control! Steam Park is an easy-to-learn game with two difficulty levels: one for the less experienced gamers and a more strategic one for those who want a more exciting challenge. In this management game, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to build your own amusement park and make it the largest and most profitable in the region. By constructing the three-dimensional, wonderful rides designed by Marie Cardouat, you will see your park grow right before your eyes. Choose your strategy! Build Stands to attract more Visitors, or Toilets to keep the Dirt under control. Whatever decision you take, take it quickly: The less time you spend planning, the more time you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to maintain your park. Thanks to a clever, original action-choosing mechanism, winning in Steam Park is as much a matter of being the best as of being the fastest!</notes>

    <notes>Game has only been played once. All the pieces are included. All the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;rides_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; have been assembled. I would say that it is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but i would rather error on the side of caution and say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in case there is some unforeseen defect that I have not noticed, as I said it has only been out of the box one time so everything is in great condition. Feel free to ask any questions! Thanks!</notes>
