   <description>You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, but that's not enough for you because only the merchant with two _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;seals of excellence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Jaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and luck. On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game was opened and played once so it is new condition. It even still has that new game smell. 
Everything is here and in perfect condition. 
Buyer will pay shipping, my zip is 15202. Since the game is small a priority flat rate box should do the trick and get it to you in 3 days!
I enjoyed the game but my wife was not a fan. Since she is who I play 2-player games with I will have to let this gem go (the game not my wife). </notes>

My kingdom for a camel!
Work hard, earn more than your opponent and become the official merchant of the Maharaja.
At the beginning of the game, three camel cards and two merchandise cards are on the table between the players, who already have five cards in hand. On your turn, you can take some cards or sell some. Each time that you take cards, you can take one or more, however if you decide to take more, then you will have to trade in the same amount of cards from your hand that you take. If you decide to take all camel cards, then they can be used later to trade. You can sell all the merchandise that you want, as long as they are all the same type. For each sale, you will receive tokens with various point values. At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of the camels also wins points.  At the end of each round, the richest merchant will receive a Seal of Excellence.  The first player who receives two of the seals, wins the game.

Work hard, earn more than your opponent and become the official merchant of the Maharaja.
 
At the beginning of the game, three camel cards and two merchandise cards are on the table between the players, who already have five cards in hand. On your turn, you can take some cards or sell some. Each time that you take cards, you can take one or more, however if you decide to take more, then you will have to trade in the same amount of cards from your hand that you take. If you decide to take all camel cards, then they can be used later to trade. You can sell all the merchandise that you want, as long as they are all the same type. For each sale, you will receive tokens with various point values. At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of the camels also wins points. At the end of each round, the richest merchant will receive a Seal of Excellence. The first player who receives two of the seals, wins the game.</notes>

My kingdom for a camel. Work hard, earn more than your opponent and become the official merchant of the Maharaja. At the beginning of the game, three camel cards and two merchandise cards are on the table between the players, who already have five cards in hand. On your turn, you can take some cards or sell some. Each time that you take cards, you can take one or more, however if you decide to take more, then you will have to trade in the same amount of cards from your hand that you take. If you decide to take all camel cards, then they can be used later to trade. You can sell all the merchandise that you want, as long as they are all the same type. For each sale, you will receive tokens with various point values. At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of the camels also wins points. </notes>

My kingdom for a camel. Work hard, earn more than your opponent and become the official merchant of the Maharaja. At the beginning of the game, three camel cards and two merchandise cards are on the table between the players, who already have five cards in hand. On your turn, you can take some cards or sell some. Each time that you take cards, you can take one or more, however if you decide to take more, then you will have to trade in the same amount of cards from your hand that you take. If you decide to take all camel cards, then they can be used later to trade. You can sell all the merchandise that you want, as long as they are all the same type. For each sale, you will receive tokens with various point values. At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of the camels also wins points.</notes>

    <notes>I bought my copy at the same time as my gaming partner bought his, and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve wound up playing with his copy, so mine is open but has only enjoyed one play.
All components are present and in their original condition. The box still has the shrink wrap over the lid; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s slit on three edges to allow it to slide off the base.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship the item via USPS Priority Mail, which I expect will cost around $7.30 to most locations in the USA, coming from Pittsburgh, PA. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mark up the shipping price; I charge exactly what it costs me for the USPS online rate.
In addition to accepting payment via PayPal, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also accept Google Wallet or an Amazon gift card. Please let me know if you have any questions, such as shipping or payment via alternate means.</notes>

My kingdom for a camel. Work hard, earn more than your opponent and become the official merchant of the Maharaja. At the beginning of the game, three camel cards and two merchandise cards are on the table between the players, who already have five cards in hand. On your turn, you can take some cards or sell some. Each time that you take cards, you can take one or more, however if you decide to take more, then you will have to trade in the same amount of cards from your hand that you take. If you decide to take all camel cards, then they can be used later to trade. You can sell all the merchandise that you want, as long as they are all the same type. For each sale, you will receive tokens with various point values. At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of the camels also wins points.</notes>

Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 5.90
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 7.35
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 7.35
Registered Post: (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 9.10
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 12.40
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 12.40
Registered post everywhere else. 
Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>

    <notes>Version - Gameworks French/German/English, unknown edition (box back does not match BGG images for first, second, or third edition, and Spanish rules not indicated on back of box)
Condition - New in shrink-wrap
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a small size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
