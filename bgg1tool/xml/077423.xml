   <description>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative card game that puts 1-2 players (or up to four with two Core Sets!) in control of the most powerful characters and artifacts of Middle-earth. Players will select heroes, gather allies, acquire artifacts, and coordinate their efforts to face Middle-earth’s most dangerous fiends. By cooperating to overcome the obstacles drawn from the encounter deck, you will complete the quest before you and claim victory!
In The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, players take on the roles of heroes attempting to complete dangerous quests. These quests take place during a broad span, beginning near the end of The Hobbit, and culminating near the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring. Instead of directly retelling the classic stories that have previously been narrated, this game provides players with a variety of elements - characters, settings, enemies, events, items, artifacts, scenarios - that allow them to embark upon new adventures and share new experiences with these beloved characters during this ominous period of Middle-earth history.</notes>

These quests take place during a broad span, beginning near the end of The Hobbit, and culminating near the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring. Instead of directly retelling the classic stories that have previously been narrated, this game provides players with a variety of elements—characters, settings, enemies, events, items, artifacts, scenarios—that allow them to embark upon new adventures and share new experiences with these beloved characters during this ominous period of Middle-earth history.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG MEC01)
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative card game that puts 1-2 players (or up to four with two Core Sets!) in control of the most powerful characters and artifacts of Middle-earth. Players will select heroes, gather allies, acquire artifacts, and coordinate their efforts to face Middle-earth’s most dangerous fiends. By cooperating to overcome the obstacles drawn from the encounter deck, you will complete the quest before you and claim victory!
The Core Set includes 226 cards that can be used to assemble a wide variety of decks right out of the box. Included are three perilous quests that, along with countless combinations of settings and enemies, offer near-limitless replayability.
Additionally, players can build a party from a set of 12 hero cards, and focus their decks on any combination of four distinct spheres of influence: Leadership, Lore, Spirit, and Tactics. Each sphere offer unique benefits to the party, so choose wisely!
Monthly 60-card expansion packs called Adventure Packs will introduce new quests, heroes, allies, attachments, events, and encounters, allowing players to fully customize their game and continue their fight against the Dark Lord!</notes>

    <notes>This is for the Lord of the Rings card game.
Everything is in great condition, this auction includes premium sleeves with different backs for all the cards.  (i.e. the Shadow deck has a different back type from the hero cards.)  I can include 50 more premium sleeves for $1, and if you want an extra 200 premium sleeves or whatever, we can do that.
Shipping with the box is $14.00 within the U.S.  Shipping without the LotR box is $7.00 - I will make sure to ship the cards securely in a small box.
I will ship to Europe or wherever if you want to exclude the box and just want the cards, shipping to Europe will be $15.00.</notes>

    <notes>The game box, insert, rule book, and all contents are in exceptional like new condition.  The cards have all been sleeved since I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve owned this game, so they are all in excellent shape.
Though the cards have been in sleeves while being played, they will be removed when the game is sold unless the buyer would like to keep the sleeves with them (they are Mayday Games Sleeves and fit very nicely).  It will be $3 extra to keep the sleeves.
Shipping charges are for Domestic US shipping with USPS Parcel Post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Delivery Confirmation.  I can also do Priority Mail if you prefer which will be faster, but a bit more expensive (probably about $10.99)  I also have the Hunt for Gollum expansion pack for sale here on Board Game Geek, be sure to check that out as combined shipping is available (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure I could ship them both for about the shipping charges for the Core Set) and I am open to best offers.
Also please note there will be a 2% discount given on purchase + shipping if the buyer pays with a Check or Cash instead of Paypal.
Thanks for your interest and please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask any questions.  </notes>

This auction includes both threat counters and all the tokens, not yet punched out. It includes the three core set encounters, all the heroes, and those player cards we did not need for our decks. (We took the cards we needed to have three of everything for our two-player decks. This leaves the majority of the player cards behind.)

    <notes>I am including the Hunt for Gollum Expansion.
This is a really interesting game. I love the theme but we just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t take to the game mechanisms and the expansions idea for some reason . All of the game components (cards, counters, scoreboards, rules, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game a couple of times. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.

This includes all of the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, Khazad-dûm, The entire Dwarrowdelf cycle, and the first Hobbit expansion. All player cards have been kept in a binder or sleeved. Encounter cards have been kept in the game box sorted with GeckoTH_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s awesome dividers. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have adventure pack boxes, nor do I have all of the inserts for those packs, but they are available on FFG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s website. All the cards are in great condition, most scenarios have been played once if at all. Shipment is up for discussion.</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is my Lord of the Rings LCG collection. This has hardly been played and is 100% complete. This would be a great way for someone to get into the game.  It is an awesome game, but I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have anyone to play this with, and I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time required for deck-building. This sale includes:
Core Set
Khazad Dum Expansion
The Hunt for Gollum
Conflict at the Car-rock
A Journey to Rhosgobel
The Hills of Emyn Muil
The Dead Marshes
Return to Mirkwood
The Redhorn Gate
Road to Rivendell
The Watcher in the Water
I basically priced them at $20 each for the core set and Khazad Dum expansion, and $10 apiece for the adventure packs. Given their new condition, this seems like a fair price. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!
Thanks!

    <notes>Hi,
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m hoping to sell off my Lord of the Rings: The Card Game collection. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get:
*Two complete copies of the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game core set - both sets are opened, one set of tokens is punched (other is unpunched); cards were only ever played with in Dragon Shield sleeves
*One brand new copy of each of the six adventure packs in the Mirkwood cycle - all brand new and never opened; the cycle consists of The Hunt for Gollum (DL= 4), Conflict at the Carrock (DL= 7), A Journey to Rhosgobel (DL= 6), The Hills of Emyn Muil (DL= 4), The Dead Marshes (DL= 5), Return to Mirkwood (DL= 7)
*One brand new copy of the Khazad-dûm expansion - brand new and never opened
All of these items have been adult owned and come from a non-smoking, no pet home. Item ships within Australia only--shipping is an additional $10. Alternately, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to meet up in the Sydney CBD and give you the items directly without any shipping costs.
Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to contact me to the extent you have any questions and thanks for your interest!</notes>

    <notes>This package comes with at least one of everything released so far except for the print on demand expansions. I have the boxes for 2 out of the 3 core sets, and at least 1 box of each of the expansions. I will be shipping this in the white card holder shown, I will rubber band it down so stuff doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hopefully move.
It also comes with those tokens in the picture in the Plano box pictured.
This is the perfect lot to get everything for a good price.

    <notes>I am selling my collection of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game cards by Fantasy Flight Games. I have one Core Set, all 6 of the Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure packs, and the Khazad-Dum deluxe expansion set. All cards come sleeved in penny sleeves.
All of the expansion cards have only been played with sleeves. The core was played for about a month without sleeves, so keen eyes can see some wear around the edges, but in my experience, the glare of the card sleeves obscures that to the point that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice it unless I really look for it.
The box has seen better days. It got checked onto a plane in my bag and the weight of the cards knocked the bottom out when the bag was tossed around. The box has been reinforced with packing tape and has not given me any problems since then. This is the sole reason why the condition is marked as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. I feel that the expansion cards are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition and the core components themselves are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.
I do not have the boxes for the expansions, but all rules inserts are included.
I will upload images of the box and comparison of core and expansion cards later. If you are interested and you see no images, PM me to give me reminder about the images ;).</notes>

(The Core Set is required to play the following adventure packs)
The Hunt for Gollum (DL=4)
Conflict at the Carrock (DL=7)
A Journey to Rhosgobel (DL=6)
The Hills of Emyn Muil (DL=4)
The Dead Marshes (DL=5)
Return to Mirkwood (DL=7)

I can include empty expansion boxes if desired, but cards are all together in the core box.  Thanks for looking!</notes>

Been played solo a few times, still in great shape (cards sleeved).  Message me if you have any questions!  This is a great intro set if you are just getting into the game.</notes>

    <notes>Good to Like New condition (hence, very good). Base game box top has some damage to corners, see pictures. This also includes the first four of the six Shadows of Mirkwood decks (Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, Journey to Rhosgobel and The Hills of Emyn Muil). All cards sleeved in penny sleeves (so they are protected but they are too long for the cards). Other than sleeving the expansion decks, they were never used.

    <notes>This is not for a complete game!
This is for the leftovers from my second core set. This is good if you want to boost your collection to 4 players and have a third copy of the X2 player cards, w/out having to get a whole other base set.
Includes 2 threat trackers, a complete set of  resource/wound/quest tokens, 2 Gandalf cards, and one of every X2 player card in the base set. If wanted, I can also include a first player marker, one of every hero in the base set, one of every quest card in the base set, and one of each monster group in the base set.
This should all ship small flat rate  :)
This does not include the base game box, the rules, any X1 player cards, the other half of the X2 player cards, or any of the X3 player cards (which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m keeping for proxies).</notes>

    <notes>Rated GOOD only due to the condition of the base game BOX.
There are no box inserts in any boxes, to better facilitate sleeved cards. All cards are sleeved in Fantasy Flight silver sleeves.  The core set box has some medium shelf wear. All that has been played of this game collection were two decks created for The Hobbit Over Hill and Under Hill, consisting of cards from the core set and that expansion only.  We played a quarter of a game.  This collection comes from a smoke free, pet free, no food or drink at the gaming table home.  We are the original owners.  If you have questions on the condition please ask for pictures before purchasing. The collection includes:
 The Core Set 
 Khazad-dûm
 
The Hunt for Gollum
The Dead Marshes   -  No box and MISSING the ally Elfenhelm
Return to Mirkwood
The Redhorn Gate
The Watcher in the Water  -  No box
Foundations of Stone  
Shadow and Flame  -   No box
Over Hill and Under Hill
On the Doorstep 
The Black Riders
The Road Darkens</notes>

Canada: between $20-30, depending on the weight and how far you are from BC.

    <notes>Here we have 2 core sets. With 2 core sets you can play up to 4 players because you get 4 dials to track your threat. You can also build better decks as most of the powerful cards are in the base set. 
I have the entire mirkwood cycle though I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the boxes for hunt for Gollum or conflict at the carrock. 
I have the khazadum expansion too. 
All instructions for each expansion are present. 
All the above fit into one box with plenty of room for more. As you can see I printed off dividers to organise the cards by there respective symbol which makes game set up extremely fast.....and to be honest looks rather cool. You get 2 rule books, 1st player token and double the amount of tokens which are stored in a container with 3 compartments.
Every card gas been sleeved in ultra pro deck protectors (with seal of approval) and I will supply between 300 to 1000 more (can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember the exact amount so whatever I have left I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll provide) so if you decide to get more expansions you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have the sleeves. 
More info below 
Core Set (includes 12 heroes, player and encounter cards, and 3 scenarios): 
Passage Through Mirkwood (Difficulty Level=1) 
Journey Down the Anduin (DL=4) 
Escape from Dol Guldur (DL=7)

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGMEC01)
The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative card game that puts 1-2 players (or up to four with two Core Sets!) in control of the most powerful characters and artifacts of Middle-earth. Players will select heroes, gather allies, acquire artifacts, and coordinate their efforts to face Middle-earth_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most dangerous fiends. By cooperating to overcome the obstacles drawn from the encounter deck, you will complete the quest before you and claim victory! The Core Set includes 226 cards that can be used to assemble a wide variety of decks right out of the box. Included are three perilous quests that, along with countless combinations of settings and enemies, offer near-limitless replayability. Additionally, players can build a party from a set of 12 hero cards, and focus their decks on any combination of four distinct spheres of influence: Leadership, Lore, Spirit, and Tactics. Each sphere offer unique benefits to the party, so choose wisely! Monthly 60-card expansion packs called Adventure Packs will introduce new quests, heroes, allies, attachments, events, and encounters, allowing players to fully customize their game and continue their fight against the Dark Lord!</notes>

* I also have separately listed 3 more adventure packs and the other Hobbit expansion in New/Sealed condition -- add all of them for an extra $25 (listed separately for $50). [The attached pics show these items, but they are not included in the list price.]
* Buyer pays actual shipping costs
*** Extra note about condition. I want you to be 100% satisfied with your purchase, so please understand that the cards are used and have been handled for several games without sleeves. Some of them show more wear than others. I have not double checked the condition of every single card. We have tried our best to keep them in decent, playable condition, but havent gone to extreme lengths to do so. The vast majority of wear, if there is any on a card, is around the edges. All of the cards are perfectly readable, including the art. If you would like, I can look through and try to find some of the cards with the worst wear and take some photos.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a combination set of game material.  The cards themselves are really like new (never played) ; core box is in very good condition but does have wear to the box top and bottom.  No expansion boxes are included.  All cards are in the core box.  The cards included are the following sets:
Core Set
Deluxe Expansions - Heirs of Numenor, Khazad-Dum, Black Riders, Hobbit On the Doorstep, Hobbit Over Hill and Under Hill
Adventure sets - 6 adventures of the Shadows of Mirkwood series, 6 adventures of the Dwarrowdelf series and first 3 adventures of the Against the Shadow series
Print on Demand sets - Massing at Osgiliath and  Battle of Laketown
Core rule book (2 copies) plus all deluxe expansion rulebooks and adventure pack insert rules for all 15 of the above noted adventure packs are included.
Again, the condition of the cards should be excellent to like new - never played them; just sorted into groupings.  A great collection set for playing.
Buyer to pay shipping costs for either USPS priority mail or UPS Ground (I do not use FedEx).  Also, paypal fees will also be added if that payment method is the preferred payment method for the buyer.
It is possible that there can be some extra cards in this collection.  I have more than one core set rulebook but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t confirm if more than one core set of cards is included here (if so, great; but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not representing an extra core set for this collection).</notes>

    <notes>This is a mega bundle for the Lord of the Rings card game.  This comes with three core sets to start.  And a giant folder with every card in sleeved pages and sorted by type.  I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t recall exactly what and how many expansions are in this, but I know it comes with The Hobbit cards, and adventure packs all the way up to Against the Shadow cycle.  The quest decks are sorted and the core set box has a wooden insert to keep things nice and tidy.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a gently played and used game.   The game will come with several printed out scenerios from a variety of sources as well as the base game.   The box has a foam core insert for the cards and the chits are in containers, so easy to keep track of everything.
This is a fun game but just not up my alley for things I like to play very often.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played this 5-6 times - everything is sorted out in the base game box - there are dividers taped inside the box to allow for the sorting - i used the divider printouts from BGG in the files sections to create the sorting tabs. Mostly it has just been sitting on a shelf for the better part of a year or two. Time for a new home - comes from a non-smoking environment.
The box will be heavy with all these cards in it - buyer to pay actual shipping charges.</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is my copy of the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. Online retail price of everything included is over $600! All cards are very well taken care of and come from a smoke free home. I played the first 5 or 6 scenarios and as it is a blast to play I am in need of cutting down my collection and this one just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make the cut. I have two core boxes however it should be noted that I only have one copy of the core scenarios since it was just more storage space to keep the second copy of cards I wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ever going to need. Both core boxes will come with the wooden organizers with dividers from The Broken Token. This lot comes with the following:

    <notes>This sale includes the following: 2 core sets, The Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle, and 6 Saga expansions - The Hobbit Over Hill and Under Hill, The Hobbit On the Doorstep, The Black Riders, The Road Darkens, The Land of Shadows, and the Treason of Saruman. 
The sage expansion cards are still in shrink.
The cards come in two card storage containers. I only have one core box with the game pieces and all the documentation stored within. The core box shows wear from when I purchased it. The cards are like new as I only played the game twice. The game comes from a pet and smoke free home. Thank you for looking and please look at my other sales. Pictures available upon request.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve inverted the cardboard insert to accommodate the expansions and leave room for more, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a pretty tidy job in my own humble opinion. Happy to supply pics on request.
Seems like a great game but I just haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t had the time to devote to it and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to clear out some space.
There are some slight marks on the lid of the box but not such that I feel the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; rating is inaccurate - again, pics available.
I would prefer an in-person hand over in London, but happy to ship within UK if necessary.</notes>

Never played any of those.  Took all the cards out into my box with seperators.    The only one i did not pick up was the Hunt for Gollum
So:
Main game
Mirkwood Cycle except for Hunt for Gollem
Khazzum Dun expansion
Dwarrowdelf Cycle - Full
Black Riders -  Saga Expansion
The Road Darkens - Saga Expansion
 Treason of Sauroman  - Sage expansion
Box with dividers and all cards in that one box....throwing away all the other boxes.
Small box with the two turn markers and the chits.   Not sure where the main manual is...you can download it.
Everything cost me around $300.
I will pay shipping Conus.</notes>

    <notes>A few items barely used, all items opened but unused. Base Game, Khazad-Dum Expansion, Heirs of Numenor Expansion and the first twelve adventure decks: Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, The Hills of Emyn Muil, The Dead Marshes, Return to Mirkwood, A Journey to Rhosgobel, Shadow and Flame, Road to Rivendell, The Redhorn Gate, Foundations of Stone, The Long Dark and The Watcher in the water.
The story behind this is I bought it for my wife and I to pay and she had no interest. I thought she would like it since she liked Magic, but it turns out she only wants to play games where she can beat me, not work with me...lol.
I will charge actual shipping based on weight and destination once I receive that information.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>This is what I have to sell: 
2x Core sets
All of the Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle
Khazad-dum Deluxe expansion
Black Riders Saga expansion
The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill Saga expansion
Everything is in a homemade foam core insert inside one core set box which has some wear on the corners of the box. I misplaced the extra encounter cards from the second core set, but all the player cards, counters and 4x of the threat dials are included.
I have only played with the two core sets and the Hunt for Gollum adventure pack, and when I did play all the cards were sleeved so all cards are in like-new condition.
This should all fit in a flat-rate USPS box so shipping should be $13.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m downsizing, so up for sale is my entire LOTR LCG collection at a very reasonable price.
I have two or three copies of the base game, and all the following:
Shadows of Mirkwood
Dwarrowdelf cycle
Against the Shadow cycle
Ring-maker cycle
Lost Realm expansion
Angmar Awakened cycle
Saga expansions:
The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill
The Hobbit: On the Doorstep
Khazad Dum
The Black Riders
The Road Darkens
The Treason of Saruman
The Land of Shadow
Heirs of Numenor
Voice of Isengard
The Massing at Osgiliath
The Battle of Lake-Town
The Stone of Erech
The Old Forest
Fog on the Barrow-Downs
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably more cards in there (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure I have two sets of Heirs of Numenor)
Everything comes stored in three strong, plastic storage containers I bought from Staples (for $15 each). And ALL the cards are sleeved too.
This is a huge lot, at a great price. If you want to get into the LOTR LCG, this is a great deal. Like I said I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m downsizing, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just trying to pass this collection on to someone who wants it.
 I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to the US if someone wants to pay the cost, but this set if very heavy. Probably someone locally in the Toronto/ Peterborough area would be best. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to meet up and make the cash/LOTR LCG exchange in person, save someone the shipping cost.</notes>

Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle
Khazad-dum + Dwarrowdelf Cycle

Voice of Isengard + The Ring Maker Cycle
The Lost Realm + Angmar Awakened Cycle
Every saga expansion, including:
The Hobbit: Over Hill and Underhill, On the Doorstep
Fellowship of the Ring: The Black Riders, The Road Darkens
Two Towers: Treason of Saruman, Land of Shadow
Return of the King: The Flame of the West, The Mountain of Fire
Also includes the following POD expansions:
The Massing at Osgiliath
The Battle of Lake Town
The Stone of Erech
The Old Forest
Fog on the Barrow Downs
Ruins of Belegost
Also includes an old Game Night Kit (I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know which one) that came with a Leadership Aragorn promo and a playmat featuring the art from The Black Riders.
All of the player cards are sorted by sphere and type in color coded UltraPro sideloading binders. All of the encounter cards are sleeved in penny sleeves and housed in a Hobby Lobby wooden box with a broken token insert.
This is a huge collection and it is quite heavy. If you are not local, it will ship via USPS. I will very carefully package it and will require insurance.
Price is negotiable, and I am open to trades. Please let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

5. Hobbit Large Saga Expansion Over Hill _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Under Hill
6. Hobbit Large Saga Expansion On the Doorstep
b]Condition:[/b]
The cards are almost all in mint condition, immediately sleeved upon opening. There are a few unsleeved cards, that have never been played with, as well as a ziploc bag of extra encounters from the additional core set that are unsleeved.
These are top quality sleeves with custom backs. There are 4 solid colored backs for the the different factions, and all of the encounter cards have custom sleeves with the images from the back of the encounter cards printed on the back of the sleeves. They are gorgeous, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve attached pictures for you to see.
All of this is meticulously organized in a single core box, as the picture demonstrates. All of the rulebooks and chits are included. The box itself is in overall good condition, but has the expected mild wear from weighing 20~ pounds with all of the above inside.
[b]Shipping:[/b] Buyer assumes cost of shipping. This is a 20~ pound box because of all the sets included. If you are in the continental USA you can expect shipping to be between 20-35 dollars. If worldwide, contact me for details.</notes>

    <notes>This will make a great _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;starter set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - consists of the base game, the first two scenario packs in the Mirkwood Cycle (The Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock) plus the first Saga Expansion (The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill). The player cards are separated into spheres in Ultrapro deck boxes and the encounter cards are stored more deck boxes. Everything is stored in the base game box (without insert).
The base game box is a little scuffed on the edges and corners, but solid. There is no box for the expansions and no insert in the base game box. Contents are in excellent condition with no visible damage.
Shipping will probably be best by USPS Flat Rate large box - if you are close to Texas I can check shipping against your zip to see if it is cheaper. Worldwide shipping is possible, but liable to be costly due to the weight.</notes>

Some of the Hero cards of the core set have some very slight wear on the back. This is just from moving around the playing surface, but is barely noticeable. None of the cards are sleeved. The chits have some wear on them and the dials too, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not really noticeable. 
This collection is around £240 new. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather have pickup in London, but am happy to organise postage for a buyer.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling a copy of the base game [b] WITHOUT [/b] the box. The components and cards have seen minimal use, around 2-3 plays total. You will get everything in the box: Rulebook, Cards, Damage Counters, Tokens, just not the box itself.  Pictures attached. 
If you plan to play this game with any regularity it is the norm to purchase an additional base set for deck building purposes. This is a good way to get one on the cheap.
[b] Shipping: [/b] Buyer pays shipping. Given no box is involved I would default to shipping in a very small amazon box. If you desire very cheap shipping, we can go with a  a padded envelope .</notes>

    <notes>Top lid is  smashed in one corner but all the components and cards are in mint condition and unaffected by the corner smash. The lid was stepped on when it was off of the box. The bottom of the box is unaffected. 
Missing 1 progress token. You can still play the game without it. They are just little card board tokens that all look the same. All cards are accounted for in the base game and the Khazad expansion. I was received the Gollum cards with no rules so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if they are all there. There are 27 player cards and 1 hero card that I have for the Gollum pack.
Comes with Khazad-dum Expansion (rules included but not box) and The Hunt for Gollum (no rules, and no box, just a handful of cards)
Shipping is $13.00</notes>

    <notes>This is a listing for a second-hand copy of The Lord of the Rings : The Card game AND ITS 8 SAGA EXPANSIONS.
All cards were sleeved during plays and are in excellent condition. The campaign has been played once.
The box lid has some shelf wear; the edges and corners are whitened a bit.
The insert was thrown away, to make place for a more practical one.
Please contact me with your postal code for shipping fees before committing to buy!
This is the chance you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been waiting for to get ahold of all the saga expansions and the base game, no more, through one single purchase (and at a good discount!).
Thank you for your interest!</notes>

I bought multiple copies of the first few arcs Chapter Packs as well.

    <notes>This is a great collection to dive into the LoTR LCG and experience the basics of what it has to offer. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a fantastic game; my brother and I played through this collection and really enjoyed it. However, time is becoming an even more precious commodity, so this hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t gotten to the table in a while. 
This set contains the full Mirkwood cycle, the first saga expansion, the first deluxe expansion, and the first adventure in the Dwarrowdelf cycle. Specifically, in addition to the base game, includes the following:
--Mirkwood Cycle--
The Hunt for Gollum Adventure Pack
Conflict at the Carrock Adventure Pack
A Journey to Rhosghobel Adventure Pack
The Hills of Emyn Muel Adventure Pack
The Dead Marshes Adventure Pack
Return to Mirkwood Adventure Pack
--Dwarrowdelf Cycle--
The Redhorn Gate Adventure Pack
Khazad-dum deluxe expansion
The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill saga expansion (opened, but never played)

OTHER
Plastic hit point, attack strength, willpower strength and defense strength tokens.
Cards have been played with sleeves.  Many of the Saga sets have encounter cards that are still in shrink.  I have original instructions for all saga expansions and adventure packs.
Love the game, but it just doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hit the table enough and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to downsize my collection.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay shipping via FedEx Ground.  Continental US only.</notes>
