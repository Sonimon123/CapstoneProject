   <description>In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t get an agreement on the split!  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ca$h 'n Gun$ will make you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. Fun, bluffing, and tough negotiations are guaranteed, but will you dare to play? It's simply killing!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On each turn, a player will assume the role of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, and will call out the steps in gameplay._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players. This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After that, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bang!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Click! Click!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; from a set of 8 cards: 2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bang!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;s, 1 Triple-_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bang!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and 5 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Clicks!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Chicken Out_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and remove themselves from the skirmish. If they choose to back down, they will get a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Chicken_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But all players have to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Chicken Out_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards. First, all Triple-_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bangs!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; wound the players they are aimed at. If there are still-aiming players with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bang!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards, those now wound their targets. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Click!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;s are only bluffs and do nothing. A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game). Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Chickened Out_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Now the remaining players will finally split the cash. If the cash cannot be divided evenly, the rest is kept on the table and is added to the new pot._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is played 8 rounds, until all cards were played. Keeping track of the cards is important, since all players have only a limited supply of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;real_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; shots._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are a couple of expansions packed-in with most editions that change some of the mechanics of the game, and also add a new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;traitor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;-based mechanic, as well._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee Editions (ASM CGEN01)
In an abandoned warehouse, a band of gangsters are splitting their latest haul, but they can’t come to an agreement on the split. It’s time to let the guns do the talking, and soon everyone is aiming at everyone... All you have to do is stay alive and have the most money at the end of the game!
This game will make you relive the best scenes from gangster movies and other modern detective stories, where the fl imsiest excuse serves to let bullets fly! Fun, bluff and negotiations are to be had. Thing is, do you have enough guts to play? This is a game where laughter isn’t the only deadly thing...  A game for 4 to 6 players, edited by Repos Production and distributed by Asmodee editions LLC.
A game with a riotous ambiance, easy rules and foam guns; this game is like no other game ever made. Doesn’t keep it from being fun; if you don’t buy this game, Freddy the Fish is going to pay you a visit; cool game material, outstanding game ambiance, pity the cops always show up too fast; this box contains the basic rules, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Super Powers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; advanced rules and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;A cop in the Mafia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rules variant.
Contains:
6 foam guns
6 set of 8 bullet cards
1 Quick Reference card
14 Wound tokens
14 Shame markers
40 bank notes
6 Characters to be inserted in their base so that they can stand up

    <notes>Hi there!
Up for sale is Ca$h _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Gun$. I also have the Yakuzas Expansion for sale here on BGG. I have limited closet space and need to sell some games. These are games that are in near-new condition, played only once, and just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t click with my gaming group. They come from a smoke-free, adult home with no kids and no pets. I take absolute meticulous care of all my board games. I do not allow friends to eat and drink while playing these games. Hopefully they can find a home in your inventory where they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be played and loved :)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGG, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much feedback, but you can check my eBay account (x.metal), which has over 820 feedback with no negatives. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping for multiple items.
Send me a geekmail if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMCGEN01)
When the guns come out, the bullets do all the talking. A band of hardened criminals heads back to the warehouse to split the take - but everyone disagrees on just how to split the loot. Tempers flare and bullets fly as everyone fights for their piece of the pie. Draw your weapon or hit the floor, because only the gutsiest crooks are leaving here with the money! That is, unless they leave in a bag... Ca$h_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Gun$ relives the best scenes from gangster movies and crime stories, where each player will use his foam gun to threaten the others and claim his share of the cash. Bluff your opponents into dropping their guns and taking cover, but remember that sometimes, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better to exercise the better part of valor and live to fight another day! After all, you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t claim the money if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re dead. Ca$h_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Gun$ is the wacky game of bluffing and gunplay for four to six players. With hilarious art, stacks of fake bank notes and life-size foam pistols, Ca$h_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;N Gun$ will have you waving guns and laughing hysterically as you make your play for your cut of the take. </notes>

    <notes>German Repos Productions edition! The game is in very good condition and has been played only a couple times. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only minimal wear on the box.  
All games are from a petfree, nonsmoker home.
Shipping costs refer to Germany. In this case they are 4,80 €. Shipping includes bubble wrap (something I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship without) I will ship anywhere. Feel free to ask or prices!</notes>

Instead of each character having 2 stands; each character has only one stand. (I never noticed until I double-checked the contents list. 1 stand is fine.)
The back of the box says the game comes with 70 cards. In the instructions of the game, they only list 69 different cards. On the picture on the box, there are 2 Turn Summary over-views. The instructions and game only have 1.
Note: I have not sold many games, but I do have a very good trader rating.

This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Repos/Heidelberger German edition with black guns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The rules for the game are in German, but I have included a home printed copy of the English rules
The box has quite a lot of shelf wear: the corners show white through the black of the box art and the sides have been worn/scuffed similarly (though not right through to the white). The components are in very good condition, showing few signs of wear. The game has quite simply been on the shelf for a long time.
Included in the game are two copies of the expansion card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Size Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t Matter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and one copy of the expansion card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Uzi_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.</notes>

    <notes>Box has one split corner and is missing two wound markers (12 instead of 14).  However, with six players taking a maximum of two wounds each, 12 wound markers should be enough.
The box has some shelf wear and whitening on the corners and the rules don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t lay perfectly flat.  Otherwise, the game looks unplayed.  The contents look great and the cards are nice and crisp.</notes>

    <notes>For those of you who don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the art or the lack of Bang! Bang! Bang! cards and shame tokens in the new edition, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a copy of the old edition.
Condition: good. A well-loved copy with orange guns. Some wear, a sticker on the box, a couple of plastic character stands missing (there are still enough to stand all of the characters).
Includes the mini-expansion Ca$h _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Gun$: Size Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t Matter.
Postage within UK: £4

No English rulebook but everything else is in English (except for a few Chinese characters on the box).

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMCGEN01)
When the guns come out, the bullets do all the talking. A band of hardened criminals heads back to the warehouse to split the take - but everyone disagrees on just how to split the loot. Tempers flare and bullets fly as everyone fights for their piece of the pie. Draw your weapon or hit the floor, because only the gutsiest crooks are leaving here with the money! That is, unless they leave in a bag... Ca$h_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Gun$ relives the best scenes from gangster movies and crime stories, where each player will use his foam gun to threaten the others and claim his share of the cash. Bluff your opponents into dropping their guns and taking cover, but remember that sometimes, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better to exercise the better part of valor and live to fight another day! After all, you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t claim the money if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re dead. Ca$h_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Gun$ is the wacky game of bluffing and gunplay for four to six players. With hilarious art, stacks of fake bank notes and life-size foam pistols, Ca$h_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;N Gun$ will have you waving guns and laughing hysterically as you make your play for your cut of the take.</notes>
