   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) is a board game in which one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes. During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks. And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you'll need every advantage you can take..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Featuring double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Compared to the first edition of Descent: Journeys in the Dark, this game features:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Simpler rules for determining line of sight _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Faster setup of each encounter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Defense dice to mitigate the tendency to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;math out_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; attacks_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Shorter quests with plenty of natural stopping points_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Cards that list necessary statistics, conditions, and effects_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A new mechanism for controlling the overlord powers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Enhanced hero selection and creation process_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Experience system to allow for hero growth and development_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Out-of-the-box campaign system_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Descent 1st edition Conversion Kit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Descent: Journeys in the Dark (second edition) – Conversion Kit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for a pre-order of a brand new copy of Descent: Journeys in the Dark (2nd edition). The estimated due date is late-July.
UK shipping costs are £5.50 to your neearest collect+ convenience store (where you can then pick up the parcel whenever they are open) or £6.50 delivered to your door. Delivery normally takes 3-5 days. We only deliver to the mainland UK since shipping to Europe and further afield is ludicrously expensive.
If you are interested please respond to this marketplace listing and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll register your interest. Payment and fulfilment would then happen once we get a confirmed date from the supplier.
If you would like to buy multiple copies let me know and we can sort out a saving on postage costs for you.
Happy gaming!

Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie können Ihre Vertragserklärung innerhalb von 1 Monat ohne Angabe von Gründen in Textform (z. B. Brief, Fax, E-Mail) oder – wenn Ihnen die Sache vor Fristablauf überlassen wird – durch Rücksendung der Sache widerrufen. Die Frist beginnt nach Erhalt dieser Belehrung in Textform, jedoch nicht vor Eingang der Ware beim Empfänger (bei der wiederkehrenden Lieferung gleichartiger Waren nicht vor Eingang der ersten Teillieferung) und auch nicht vor Erfüllung unserer Informationspflichten gemäß Artikel 246 § 2 in Verbindung mit § 1 Abs. 1 und 2 EGBGB sowie unserer Pflichten gemäß § 312e Abs. 1 Satz 1 BGB in Verbindung mit Artikel 246 § 3 EGBGB. Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist genügt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs oder der Sache.
Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:
Adrian Czibere
Augustin-Buselmeier Str.24
79365  Rheinhausen
docholiday0815@yahoo.de 
Widerrufsfolgen
Im Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren und ggf. gezogene Nutzungen (z. B. Zinsen) herauszugeben. Können Sie uns die empfangene Leistung ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurückgewähren, müssen Sie uns insoweit ggf. Wertersatz leisten. Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung – wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre – zurückzuführen ist. Für eine durch die bestimmungsgemäße Ingebrauchnahme der Sache entstandene Verschlechterung müssen Sie keinen Wertersatz leisten.
Paketversandfähige Sachen sind auf unsere Gefahr zurückzusenden. Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, wenn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen innerhalb von 30 Tagen erfüllt werden. Die Frist beginnt für Sie mit der Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung oder der Sache, für uns mit deren Empfang.

Everything fits in the original game box and the insert is included. Played 6 or 7 times. Shipping is £10 pounds via 2-day tracked Parcelforce.

I am only selling this to UK buyers, as shipping is too expensive to the rest of Europe.

Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition is a board game in which one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes. Featuring double-sided modular board pieces, countless hero and skill combinations, and an immersive story-driven campaign, Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition transports heroes to a vibrant fantasy realm where they must stand together against an ancient evil. This updated version of the classic board game of dungeon-delving adventure features a host of enhancements, including new heroes and monsters, streamlined rules, a class-based hero system, campaign play, and much more. </notes>

    <notes>This includes: 2nd edition + The Trollfens exp + Lair of the Wyrm exp + Labyrinth of Ruin exp.
All were purchased new, have been opened, punched, and organized. I have owned since December; however, we never got to playing it and I do not see playing it in the near future, so instead of game gathering dust, I am looking for a new home for it. All pieces are accounted for, including manuals, and will include plastic containers for the figures and bits. If you would like pictures, just ask. </notes>

    <notes>The base game has only been played 3 or 4 times.  Contents are complete but original insert has been trashed - components are all bagged and in excellent condition.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened the expansion content but never used any of it.  The box has a bit of wear, mostly due to sloppy handling and delivery from Amazon, but nothing too serious.  Attached is a photo of the damage.
Includes:
- Forgotten Souls co-op expansion
- Belthir Lieutenant Pack
- Zacareth Lieutenant Pack
- Splig Lieutenant Pack
- Alric Farrow Lieutenant Pack
- Merick Farrow Lieutenant Pack
- Eliza Farrow Lieutenant Pack
Game will ship the day after order is received.  Shipping will be USPS Priority mail and should be around $15.</notes>

    <notes>Included in this sale:
-Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)
-Lair of the Worm Expansion (like new, unpunched)
-Descent FIRST edition Heroes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; cards
-Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) Conversion Kit
-2X Extra Dice Packs (in addition to the dice in the base game, 3 sets in total)
All the components of the game (cards, figures, dice, game board pieces, etc) are accounted for and are in mint condition.  However, a humid summer has caused the box to become warped.  It is structurally sound, but its sides are no longer perfectly straight.  All other components were protected in bags or plano boxes and were not affected.  Shipping will be an additional 16.00 due to the amount of components in the game adding weight.  I will ship the item out one business day after receiving payment.
NOTE: Not all items included in this sale are pictured. Many tokens _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; game pieces were left out of the pictures, but are still included in the sale.  The game and expansions are complete, and nothing to my knowledge is missing.  Also- during picture taking I did not separate expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; base game figures from one another, they are all grouped together.</notes>

This updated version of the classic board game of dungeon-delving adventure features a host of enhancements, including new heroes and monsters, streamlined rules, a class-based hero system, campaign play, and much more.</notes>

    <notes>[b]Condition[/b]: Played, but everything in great condition, including original box (without useless insert). All components accounted for. 
About half the minis are painted. I received them that way, and I think they look very nice, but it was not done by a professional. 
[b]Payment[/b]: Amazon.com gift card is preferred. US money orders and checks accepted, though shipping will be delayed until clearing.  
[b]International[/b]: I will consider selling to most locations internationally if the user has some trade and marketplace reputation and pays for mailing insurance (or willing to bear the risk). Be aware that international mailing costs can be very expensive.
[b]Ships from[/b] 07650; buyer pays actual shipping cost. Free local pickup available in Northern NJ near GWB, or midtown and lower Manhattan.

    <notes>Deutsche Ausgabe, einmal gespielt. Die Karten waren in Hüllen und sind daher auch noch in neuwertigem Zustand. 
Versand innerhalb Deutschlands als DHL-Paket ist 5,99 €
Versand außerhalb Deutschlands ist grundsätzlich auch möglich, allerdings lohnt sich das bei den derzeitigen Versandpreisen eigentlich nicht. Ihr könnt mich aber gerne anschreiben, wenn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trotzdem sein soll.
---------------------
This is the German edition of the game. Played once. Cards were sleeved so they are still in pristine condition.
Shipping within Germany is 5,99€
Generally speaking, shipping outside of Germany is also possible, yet not really practical due to the high shipping costs these days. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d still like to have this shipped internationally, just contact me and I can provide the shipping costs for your destination</notes>

    <notes>80% of the figures painted! Played only twice! I am attempting to reduce my game collection size and this game just never made it to the table enough. It is a really fun game, however my game group just never got into it and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather see it get play time at another game group or household. I take pride in my game collection and take very good care of my games. This game, the rules, and box are in excellent condition. The game comes with the following:
Base Game (*Majority Painted*)
The Trollfens Expansion (*Majority Painted*)
Lair of the Wyrm Expansion (*Majority Painted*)
Labyrinth of Ruin Expansion (*Majority Painted*)

Belthir Lieutenant Miniature Pack

    <notes>I have played the game once, otherwise it is in excellent condition. One of the box corners is slightly bumped but I would consider that cosmetic and it was how it arrived when I purchased it. 
All cards, other than hero cards are sleeved.
I also have the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Journeys in the Dark Second Edition Conversion Kit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which provides the cards of characters and monsters of the 1st edition (Core plus major expansions, promos etc.) in the new 2nd edition format for compatibility with the 2nd edition. You can use that to add a lot of replayability with simple tokens (no need to own 1st edition minis)  This has never been played and all cards (other than the hero cards) are sleeved. The suggested price for the conversion kit would be £15. 
Shipping to the UK would be £5.95 with myHermes. 
Please get in touch for a shipping quote if you live outside the UK and within EU.</notes>

All boxes are in excellent condition with mild shelf wear (if any). Local pickup (Raleigh, NC area - Wilmington, NC around Christmas Day) is preferred, or seller pays to ship. I would be interested in either cash or trade for similar Imperial Assault base game + expansions. Buyer pays $100 + shipping.

For Sale is everything I own for Descent: Journeys in the Dark 2nd Edition. Space is getting limited and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play it much. Everything is in near mint condition and nicely boxed in two peanut filled boxes. Shipping is included to avoid inaccurate shipping quotes. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also included in the price a split between BGGs _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; paypals 3% to help with costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d prefer some other payment besides paypal but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll accept it.
Here is a list of the game, expansions, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; lieutenants. I can provide pictures if requested.

    <notes>This game been played four times. I have cared for it well, Everything is included.
Please note that I am selling other descent items. that are in Like New condition. I bought other editions planning to play with a friend who died. It will not take with my current gaming group. 
There is a slight tear on corner of the box which I have repaired. It is barely noticeable.
I will ship in USA using USPS. Do not ask for a shipping estimate. I am not making two trips to the post office. Once you place your order I will get the shipping estimate and send it to you. I will send it as cheaply as possible. It will likely be between $10-15 dollars.
I will send it elsewhere in the world, but do not expect the shipping to be cheap. Sending things to the Pacific (Asia) seems to be more expensive than Europe.</notes>

    <notes>Selling Descent Second Edition Journey in the Dark with the following expansions: ‘The Trollfens’ and ‘Manor of Ravens’ small box expansions, and ‘Shadow of Nerekhall’ big box expansion.
Game has been played twice. The main Descent box has a scuff (pictured) and one of the miniatures has a broken tail (pictured); tail is provided in a plastic bag and can be glued on; both of these defects were present when purchased.  Otherwise everything is in excellent condition. Cardboard inserts of all four boxes have been thrown away.
Contents are stored in the following manner:
•All hero miniatures are stored in the ‘Manor of Ravens’ box using a foam insert along with the dice, two rule books and hero sheets.
•All cards and tokens are stored in the ‘Trollfens’ box using zip bags.
•All other miniatures are stored in the main Descent box using a foam insert. Some are in zip bags as there isn’t enough room in the insert for some of the larger miniatures. Also doors, stands and special map tiles (end pieces and connectors) are stored in this box.
•All other map tiles are stored in the ‘Shadow of Nerekhall’ box.
All four boxes are pretty full!
Descent and expansions were all purchases from Amazon in May 2017 brand new.
Delivery via ParcelForce (2 working days) estimated shipping cost is approx. £15 (not included in listed price)
Please UK residents only. Any questions please contact me.</notes>

    <notes>Please read this listing carefully. 
Selling cheap as I need the space back in our dining room/games room. 
The box is a little bit scuffed and worn. All the pieces are in perfect condition with no wear.
I have painted about half the models and the rest are primed. Please see the photos for inspection. I have painted 4 of the 8 main characters, one from each class. I have also painted the Zombies, Flesh Moulders, Goblin Archers, Spiders. They were painted with Privateer Press paints and primed in Black Games Workshop primer. So the models are either painted or primed in black. I am a painting hobbyist, the main characters have been meticulously painted and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very pleased with how they came out. Please look at the photos for detailed look at the minatures. 
Postage to the UK - £6. Postage to mainland Europe - £13, possibly slightly higher to Eastern European destinations. Postage is high due to the game being quite heavy.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling my copy of Descent Second Edition. The game is in good condition and comes from a smoke-free home. Included in the box is [gameid=104162], [gameid=153233] and [gameid=199884]. All have been combined into the base game box, however, I still have the original box for [gameid=199884] which can be included upon request. There is one minor flaw with the game box as shown in the included photo. One edge has some torn paper. It came to me this way out of the original shrink wrap.
SHIPPING: The buyer is responsible for paying the actual shipping costs from 28173. I typically use USPS, but will look for a cheaper option as well. Please inquire about shipping costs ahead of time so you will not be surprised. The game weighs 6lbs 6oz. The game will be shipped once payment clears.
PAYMENT: I accept PayPal as the primary payment source. I am open to alternate forms of payment, just inquire first.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling the base game and the following expansions (all in english, 2nd edition):
Labyrinth of Ruin
Shadow of Nerekhall
Lair of the Wyrm
The Trollfens
Right now everything is mixed together and the two smaller expansion boxes are empty, but they are existent and can be shipped with. Comes from a smoke free home, original owner.
Everything is very good condition, except the base box. It has a tear on the bottom where one of the tiles pressed through. I include pictures from the tear and the tile. It is fully playable.
Please keep in mind, this bundle is very heavy and big, so shipping will be around 20€ or more. But still cheaper than getting every expansion shipped separatly.

    <notes>This copy of Descent 2E (English), purchased in 2015, was opened, sleeved, and set out on the table single time, but has never been played. The inlay was cut up slightly to make better use of the internal space and one edge of the box has minor scuffing. All of the game components are in like-new condition and the cards were all sleeved within moments of first unpacking the game. (The sleeves are included in this purchase.)

    <notes>This is for an excellent Descent (2nd Edition) collection that includes the following expansions, lieutenants:  
2nd edition base game plus 1st edition base game hero minis, 1st edition conversion kit, Labrynith of Ruin, Trollfens, Lair of the Wrym, co-op Nature_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Ire, Lieutenants - Serena and Skarn and Heirs of Blood campaign hardcover book.  Note that this collection will provide both the original base game campaign - The Shadow Rune as well as Heirs of Blood.  New copies of the base game only come with Heirs of Blood and the original campaign, Shadow Rune, is difficult to acquire (unless you buy an older base game - such as this copy).
All of the above are in the Base Game and Labyrinth of Ruin boxes (no inserts and no other boxes are included  - reason the listing is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and not, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).   Components are opened, punched, bagged but in unplayed, like new condition from a smoke free home (some of the 2nd edition expansion map components and tokens are still unpunched).  Note that one base game minion monster, a Merroid,is off its base - this can be glued back on.  Boxes will have some scuffing and white edges from storage.  
Buyer to pay shipping (most likely UPS for this large collection) and pay pal fee.</notes>

The game was played only a few times, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fairly unused. Because of limited space, all the expansions were put together in the boxes you see on the pictures. No other boxes are included.
Most of the cards are sleeved, as you can see on the included pictures.
All the expansions including the base game would cost around 800 Euros if bought new - not includig the sleeves and boxes for the cards. ; )
Das Spiel wurde nur wenige Male gespielt, ist also fast unbenutzt und neuwertig. Aus Platzgründen wurden die Inlays aus den Schachteln entfernt und alle Erweiterungen finden sich in den auf den Fotos abgebildeten Boxen. Die restlichen Kartons gibt es leider nicht mehr.
Wie man am Foto auch erkennen kann, sind fast alle Karten gesleeved und die restlichen Komponenten gut sortiert verpackt.
Alle inkludierten Erweiterungen inkl. dem Grundspiel würden insgesamt um die 800 Euro neu kosten - und da sind die Sleeves und Kartons für die Karten noch gar nicht dabei. ; )</notes>
