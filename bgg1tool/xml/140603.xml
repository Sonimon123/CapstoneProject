The green Frigate is a different ship than all the Frigates for the other colors. This is how the game was from the beginning. It is a similar type of ship, but not the same. It does not affect how the game plays.
The Spain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Revenge expansion is not included (it is sold separately).

    <notes>Includes the Spain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Revenge expansion.
Game box/components are in like-new condition.  For some reason, the green frigate is a different mold than the other coloured frigates, and the rule book has a small amount of handwriting in two spots.
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

Return to a bustling Plymouth Harbor in 1572 as an aspiring Elizabethan captain making preparations for three exciting voyages to the Spanish Main in search of fame and fortune! As such captains, players will have to plan their missions and provision their ships accordingly. This is a race to see who can set sail and reach the Spanish Main first. The riches of the Aztec and Inca Empires await these swashbuckling captains. Each new voyage has its own challenges to overcome but the captured gold, silver and jewels should greatly please the Queen. Get ready for The Voyage of a Lifetime! </notes>

Return to a bustling Plymouth Harbor in 1572 as an aspiring Elizabethan captain making preparations for three exciting voyages to the Spanish Main in search of fame and fortune! As such captains, players will have to plan their missions and provision their ships accordingly. This is a race to see who can set sail and reach the Spanish Main first. The riches of the Aztec and Inca Empires await these swashbuckling captains. Each new voyage has its own challenges to overcome but the captured gold, silver and jewels should greatly please the Queen. Get ready for The Voyage of a Lifetime! </notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101411N)
Return to a bustling Plymouth Harbor in 1572 as an aspiring Elizabethan captain making preparations for three exciting voyages to the Spanish Main in search of fame and fortune! As such captains, players will have to plan their missions and provision their ships accordingly. This is a race to see who can set sail and reach the Spanish Main first. The riches of the Aztec and Inca Empires await these swashbuckling captains. Each new voyage has its own challenges to overcome but the captured gold, silver and jewels should greatly please the Queen. Get ready for The Voyage of a Lifetime! </notes>
