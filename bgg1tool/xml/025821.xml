   <description>Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;lynched_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, reveals his/her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow/les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux/Die Werw_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ouml;lfe von D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;sterwald is a published version arranged by Hervé Marly and Philippe des Pallières and published by Lui-même, 2001 for 8-23 players.

    <notes>Asmodée (ASM KG01US)
The tiny town of Millers Hollow is stunned by the discovery that it harbors werewolves, who, under the cover of darkness, kidnap and devour townsfolk. The townsfolk have organized to unmask any of their neighbors that are really monsters-by-night... then lynch the beasts to remove their evil presence from their quiet little town forever. 
To discover who the fiends are, a meeting is called, bringing together all of the townsfolk including some remarkable characters - such as the town psychic, a group of local hunters, as well as two lovers, a police captain and a nosey little girl. This diverse group will lead the inquiry, and decide the ultimate fate of the town... 
But... ssh!!... As night falls, close your eyes and be very quiet. The werewolves may come and take you if you aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t careful.

Can you find the werewolves before it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s too late? The tiny hamlet of Millers Hollow is beset by monstrous enemies hidden in their midst. Organize the townsfolk and uncover the evil in disguise, so that you can kill the beasts before they claim the entire town, and bring eternal silence to the town forever. Distrust and suspicion run rampant - can you root out the werewolves and save your town, or will you accidentally murder your neighbors in this desperate hunt? Each of you will become one of the residents of the ill-fated town of Millers Hollow. Star-crossed lovers, the police captain, and the hunters can all help hunt down the wolves, with help from the town psychic and a particularly nosy little girl. Convince your friends that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re human, or you may wind up lynched by the very townspeople you fight to protect. And if you actually are a werewolf, band with your fellow monsters to pick off the frightened townsfolk one by one, until the town belongs to you and you alone! The Werewolves of Millers Hollow is a party game for eight or more players. Featuring evocative art and social play, the game will have you bluffing, arguing and outright lying to cover up your identity and reveal the true monsters before you join their hideous ranks! </notes>

Each of you will become one of the residents of the ill-fated town of Millers Hollow. Star-crossed lovers, the police captain, and the hunters can all help hunt down the wolves, with help from the town psychic and a particularly nosy little girl. Convince your friends that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re human, or you may wind up lynched by the very townspeople you fight to protect. And if you actually are a werewolf, band with your fellow monsters to pick off the frightened townsfolk one by one, until the town belongs to you and you alone! The Werewolves of Millers Hollow is a party game for eight or more players. Featuring evocative art and social play, the game will have you bluffing, arguing and outright lying to cover up your identity and reveal the true monsters before you join their hideous ranks! </notes>

Buyer is responsible for Paypal fees, if any are incurred, and actual shipping. I typically ship via USPS parcel post and ask $5, then refund the difference down to the nearest dollar. Happy to ship other methods or with additional services. Check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling!</notes>

    <notes>German edition -- no language on cards.  Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

Can you find the werewolves before it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s too late? The tiny hamlet of Millers Hollow is beset by monstrous enemies hidden in their midst. Organize the townsfolk and uncover the evil in disguise, so that you can kill the beasts before they claim the entire town, and bring eternal silence to the town forever. Distrust and suspicion run rampant - can you root out the werewolves and save your town, or will you accidentally murder your neighbors in this desperate hunt? Each of you will become one of the residents of the ill-fated town of Millers Hollow. Star-crossed lovers, the police captain, and the hunters can all help hunt down the wolves, with help from the town psychic and a particularly nosy little girl.
