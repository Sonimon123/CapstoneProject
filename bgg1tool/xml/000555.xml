   <description>Players attract artists and scholars trying to become the most prestigious family in Florence. Each player is given a palace grid and reference chart and attempts to gain the most victory points after seven rounds. Scoring victory points can be done in a variety of ways although most will be earned by playing profession cards to generate work points. There are a variety of professions such as astronomers, organists and architects. Each is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom. The more the player can match these preferences then the more work points are generated. If a player satisfies the minimum requirement of work points, which increases each round, then the work can be created and the player can then trade the work points for cash and/or victory points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Game is complete and in great condition, close to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like-new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I rate conservatively.  Will calculate shipping costs based on zip code but it will probably be around $9.00.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the process of cleaning out the game cabinet. Look back for more deals later. For open and played games, expect prices below what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay at an online discounter. 
Shipping: I will ship most games USPS Priority Mail using a flat rate box plus Shipping Confirmation - Actual Cost: $9.65. For some games, you may be able to obtain a cheaper rate if you contact me before purchasing.
Condition notes: Princes of Florence - Brand new, still in shrink wrap, excellent exterior condition. English Language Rio Grande edition.
All games come from a non-smoking, careful environment. I hope you enjoy owning and playing these games I much as I have.
I accept Paypal or Money Order or Cashiers Check. 
I do not accept personal checks because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship your game quickly with that payment method.
Currently only shipping to the U.S. If you are in a foreign country and really want one of these games, contact me and I will try to accommodate you - be aware that international shipping costs may be substantially higher.</notes>

    <notes>This game is in great condition.  I have only played it 4 or 5 times.  Could be considered like new.  I need to make room in my closet so am selling off some unused games. I ship quickly and only charge the actual shipping costs. I accept PayPal and ship to PayPal address only. Send your zip for an exact shipping quote.
I did recently notice that the box bottom has a split corner about half way down so have lowered the price from $28 to $24.  It is an easy repair though.  I can do the repair for you at your request.  I do high quality repairs with quality glue and reinforcement paper.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games English language version of the Alea Big Box series (not the newer printing).  Complete and in excellent condition.  One of the buildings has a minor tear on the top layer of cardboard when it was punched out, does not impact game play and is not very noticable.  From a non-smoking home.
You pay all shipping charges. For domestic shipping, this game can be shipped inside a medium Priority Mail flat rate box for $11.00. This method also does not include insurance, which can be added for $1.75. I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged shipments if you do not purchase insurance. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship by another method if you prefer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping for multiple items. Use zip code 98104 to calculate shipping costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to arrange for local pickup in the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia area.
I will ship anywhere, by your choice of carrier, however there is a $10 surcharge per international shipments above the cost of shipping to compensate me for the additional time involved in shipping internationally. Note that this is per shipment, so if you buy several games from me and have them shipped together, you just pay once. Sorry to have to do this, but international shipments are much more time consuming for me than domestic shipments.
Payment by PayPal only, except for local pickup which must be paid in cash. Sorry, no checks or money orders.  I will ship within 3 days of receipt of payment.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 168)
Experience the golden age of the Renaissance. Assume the role of the head of an Italian Aristocratic dynasty and lead your family like the Medici or Borgia. The players support the builders, artists, and scholars so that their completed works will bring their families fame and prestige. As the patrons of the creators of great works, the players seek to multiply their fame and reputations, but only one will become the most prestigious prince of Florence!
 
This is the new 2010 version that adds rules for 2 players and the special _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Muse and Princess_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion that adds interesting character cards with special abilities to use during the game.

    <notes>2000 Rio Grande edition with mini-expansion from Rio Grande Treasure Box.  Played a few times, minor shelf wear, but insert was removed for better storage.  I found a great Plano case for the game which I can leave in for an additional $7 (see photo).
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the storage container included and add the additional cost to the total.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO168)
Experience the golden age of the Renaissance. Assume the role of the head of an Italian Aristocratic dynasty and lead your family like the Medici or Borgia. The players support the builders, artists, and scholars so that their completed works will bring their families fame and prestige. As the patrons of the creators of great works, the players seek to multiply their fame and reputations, but only one will become the most prestigious prince of Florence! This is the new 2010 version that adds rules for 2 players and the special _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Muse and Princess_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion that adds interesting character cards with special abilities to use during the game. </notes>
