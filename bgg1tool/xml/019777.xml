   <description>Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip; considerably, in fact _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip; let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s see_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>New and unplayed. BUT: Some of the counters have fallen out of the frame when I looked over the game to make sure that it is complete. It is complete. So it is about 90% unpunched.
The box has minimal shelfwear and one broken corner. I complained about when I bought it but got the answer that they are all slightly imperfect.
Shipping is 7.70$ within U.S., insurance 2.20$ optional.
Rules in German and English.</notes>

I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. This game will ship USPS priority mail, flat rate box. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.
Shipping cost is $10.00

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

Note that Splotter games do not come in shrinkwrap, but the game is new, and components unpunched. Not even any scuff marks (fairly rare for a 5 year old Splotter game)

    <notes>Never played. Non-smoking home. Unpunched, heck, even the zip lock bag has not been opened.
Beautiful game, challenging and interesting (and unforgiving!), but the graphic and physical design (such as it is) makes it hard to play it.
[b]The box has a split side.[/b] I was moving some games, and two fell of my hands. And sadly, Indonesia landed first, followed by Fortress America.
Which landed on top of it.
Splitting one side of the box.
And really, really, REALLY annoying the crap out of me...

    <notes>This is totally in excellently _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;playable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t purchase this if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for a collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s piece, one that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s worthy of spending eternity in a museum.  I make no promises about the box condition (has some shelf wear, shown primarily because black boxes show wear easier).  Components are in the following condition: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;we took the game out, played it a handful of times, and let it sit on the shelf for the last 2 years_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. 
This is a completely playable Splotter!  The games come from a non-smoking, non pet-shedding home, so you need not worry if you have a sensitive nose... 
$12 shipping in the US.  Add $50 to ship internationally.  </notes>

    <notes>I bought the game new and have never played. It is punched and bagged. The game box has been moved around quite a bit from shelf to shelf over the years, so it has a fair amount of shelf wear (whitening). But otherwise it is in like new condition.
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined.) I only charge exact shipping costs and will combine shipping. From US zip code: 97520.
Thanks!

Buyer is responsible for Paypal fees, if any, and actual shipping. I typically estimate a few dollars high and refund to the nearest dollar. By default I will ship USPS parcel post, but I hope you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like either faster shipment or delivery confirmation and insurance. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice!
Please look at my other games for combined shipping or other discounts!</notes>

    <notes>This copy has never been played. It does have some minor shelf wear, and some very superficial surface scuffing that that B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;B says occurred due to the Splotter not shrink-wrapping their games and is thus common - B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;B sold this copy as new condition.
The bits are all present and neatly bagged.

    <notes>I bought this brand new from Boards and Bits back in 2008, as with most (except maybe Cannes?) games from Splotter at the time (and maybe still now) they do not come shrink wrapped, see
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/737847/brand-new
As also mentioned in that thread, because the publisher doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t/didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t shrink wrap, and apparently especially with this game, there is some relatively minor shelf wear on the top side... so minor imho it had really looked to me like it was just part of the art work.
I never even read the rules so sadly never even had a chance to try to get it to the table... given I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t 6 years later, I doubt I ever will and might as well sell it while it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s out of print.</notes>

    <notes>Reasons for good condition -- NONE affect game play.
1) there is a short, small crease on the box lid near one corner. Please note that the crease does not show on the inside of the box at all.
2) there is an small spot on the otherwise blank inside cover of the rules which I attempted without success to remove. It does not affect any of the actual pages of rules.
3) the white bottom of the box, like most Splotter games, attracts dirt like a magnet. Like the small crease listed above, it has no affect on the inside of the box.
4 the bottom edges of the top of the box show some shelfwear.</notes>

- Never played, but the box has some minor wear and tear on the corners. See picture in my personal boardgamegeek-gallery for further details. If you want, I can take more photos.
- As the game has never been played, the components are in as new condition.

See the following link to Norwegian postal services for information about prices (information in Norwegian, but I assume it is relatively easy to understand for foreigners):

    <notes>I have a version that is a combo of components from the first and second editions.  It is a complete game.  I had owned the first edition, bought the second edition and combined the components which I wanted.  I am selling the left-over combo set.
Specifically, the version I am selling contains the following:
The box and all components are from the second edition, *except* the following first-edition components:
the map board, 
the city tokens (the red, green, yellow glass beads)
the city placement cards (for placing cities on the board during era change)
Buyer will pay actual shipping cost + insurance.
Let me know if you have questions or want to see pics.  Thanks for looking.</notes>
