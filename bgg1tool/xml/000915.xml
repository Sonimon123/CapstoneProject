   <description>Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue. A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;how many fat monks do you have?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;.) Players may either take a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;vow of silence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Mass_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Original Multisim edition (a semi-rare collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item!) - in French, but has an English rules printout and numerous copies of the English card translations.
The game has been played just a few times and the contents are in excellent shape apart from the French rules, which are a bit worn.  The crosses have not been cut out.  The box has a little indentation on the lid and some scuffing on the back.</notes>

    <notes>Game opened but never actually played (a friend bought it at the same time I did, and when we played his copy, I decided it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t quite my cup of tea).
PLEASE NOTE that while all game components are present and in mint condition, the box is missing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Days of Wonder web card,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which had a code allowing access to online versions of the company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s games. I did use this, so the code would now be worthless.
I will ship at cost worldwide.</notes>

    <notes>The game is complete(well, there are only 44 of the disposable Suspect sheets left out of the 50 original, since the game was only played once) and in excellent condition. 
I prefer to ship via UPS for tracking reasons, so shipping will vary depending on the destination.  The package will be well packed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting this for sale a little low because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to reduce my collection in prepration for my move. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting more games soon, so keep a eye out for those as well.</notes>

Complete (some suspects sheets have been used, but there remains over 30 which are still blank - and they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re black and white, so easily copiable too). Content is still in very good shape (some cards have very slight amount of wear). Box shows a slightly larger amount of wear. Pictures on request.
Payment by paypal (worldwide) or bank tranfer (if paid from within countries with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;euro_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; currency).
My shipping costs = actual cost of the stamp + 1 euro for packaging (shipping prices available on request)</notes>

    <notes>I ended up with a spare copy. This one is fully complete, and only played twice, I believe.  Most of the suspect sheets are still unused.  Otherwise the components look as good as new.  Just the tiniest wear on the box corners, but overall it looks pristine.

    <notes>This game is brand new. The outer shrink wrap has been removed but it has never been played. The cards themselves are still in shrink wrap proving this copy has never been played. It is the 2007 edition that includes The Pilgrims_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Chronicles expansion and it is in English. 
This game is OOP and pretty difficult to get a hold of at this time.

    <notes>This is the English language Days of Wonder edition (2003, I think). The game has only been played twice and has basically sat on my shelf for many years. The box and components still look new so everything is in great shape. The suspect pad has 43 out of the 50 sheets. (7 were used in the 2 games I played a while back. I still have them but I doubt anyone wants those.)
It fits in a USPS medium flat rate box (probably the cheapest shipping option).</notes>

    <notes>This is the first Days of Wonder edition of the game (copyright 2003). I have laminated 6 of the suspect sheets so that you can re-use them w/ dry-erase markers.
A bit of box damage: the bottom of the box and a couple of the sides have got some _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wrinkling_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;/creases on them, but the box is otherwise fine.
Approx. weight of game: 2 lbs, 13.7 oz
Will fit in a medium flat rate box. </notes>

    <notes>Condition - Punched, played a couple times. Cards and player mats laminated. Components and box in excellent condition, with little or no wear. Includes 2 copies of Pilgrims_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Chronicles expansion (one sealed) and 2 extra sets of wooden dice.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.95 (small), $13.10 (medium), or $17.90 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

Buyers pay actual shipping costs. I can give an estimate if you list your zip with your bid and send me a geekmail. All games will be shipped via USPS. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to potentially using other options if preferred. I will only charge for shipping charges and will refund any difference if I initially use an estimate. International buyers are welcome, but be aware that international shipping these days is not cheap! I will only use USPS to ship international. 
If you are relatively close by and wish to pick up the game from me in person in Los Angeles, CA, that can also be arranged. I also do a lot of driving for work, mainly on the Westside and would be more than happy to drop the game off if you live in that neck of the woods...or meet you halfway if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t.</notes>

Days of Wonder
2003
Complete, components in excellent condition! (Well, the web card that used to give free access to the Days of Wonder website isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t there any more, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not part of the game itself.) Includes board; 6 monk pieces; 6 deduction notebooks; 90 cards (24 suspects, 8 biblioteca, 18 events + 1 blank, 6 crypta, 24 scriptorium + 1 blank, 8 mass); pad of suspect sheets (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mostly full - there are six removed that are inserted into the deduction notebooks, unused, not sure if others have been used); three wooden monk dice; 1 mass bell; rule booklet; plastic box insert. 
Box has some wear (slightly crushed lid is the worst of it) but no split corners.</notes>

    <notes>Prefer PayPal or Venmo
Buyers pay actual shipping costs. I can give an estimate if you list your zip with your bid and send me a geekmail. All games will be shipped via USPS. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to potentially using other options if preferred. I will only charge for shipping charges and will refund any difference if I initially use an estimate. International buyers are welcome, but be aware that international shipping these days is not cheap! I will only use USPS to ship international. 
If you are relatively close by and wish to pick up the game from me in person in Los Angeles, CA, that can also be arranged. I also do a lot of driving for work, mainly on the Westside and would be more than happy to drop the game off if you live in that neck of the woods...or meet you halfway if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t.</notes>
