    <notes>What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Your Game? (WYGVINHOS)
In Vinhos (a Portuguese word meaning _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Wines_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) you will play the role of wine producers in Portugal. Over a period of 6 years, you will expand your business by establishing Estates in the different regions of Portugal, buying vineyards and building wineries. Skilled enologists will help you increase the quality of your wine, while top Wine Experts will enhance it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s features at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Feira Nacional do Vinho Português_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, the Wine Tasting Fair. Selling your wines to Portuguese local hangouts, will establish a market presence for your company and will help you secure the funds to expand your company, and to pay your enologists_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; salaries. But, as everyone knows, prestige cannot come from money alone. To ensure a good reputation on international markets you must meet the requirements of various Countries, by consistently exporting high-quality wines. Periodically, a Wine Tasting Fair will be held. It is up to you to decide the best time to announce which wine you intend to present. The choice of the best wine by value and features is essential to the prestige of your company and will definitely make all the difference! </notes>

Over a period of 6 years, you will expand your business by establishing Estates in the different regions of Portugal, buying vineyards and building wineries. Skilled enologists will help you increase the quality of your wine, while top Wine Experts will enhance it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s features at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Feira Nacional do Vinho Português_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, the Wine Tasting Fair. Selling your wines to Portuguese local hangouts, will establish a market presence for your company and will help you secure the funds to expand your company, and to pay your enologists_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; salaries. But, as everyone knows, prestige cannot come from money alone. To ensure a good reputation on international markets you must meet the requirements of various Countries, by consistently exporting high-quality wines. Periodically, a Wine Tasting Fair will be held. It is up to you to decide the best time to announce which wine you intend to present. The choice of the best wine by value and features is essential to the prestige of your company and will definitely make all the difference! </notes>

    <notes>Please note, that it is the German version of What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your game. This means the backside of the box is in German and the rules are in German. The game itself is totally language independent. I already printed out in color the rulebook in Dutch.
it has been played only once or twice. I really like the game, but want to have the Deluxe edition.
You can pay by banktransfer or cash when picking up as well.
Shipping costs are for the buyer</notes>

1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>

    <notes>The components are in perfect condition. Actually it has extra components. When I purchased the game some of the punchboards were damaged and they gave me replacements of the whole boards, not just the few damaged tiles, so there are a bunch of extra wine and money tokens. The only wear is slight shelf wear on the bottom of the box.</notes>
