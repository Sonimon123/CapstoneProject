   <description>Granada, 1278.  At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;native_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;wall_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Type: Economic, Map building 
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 8+
Length: 45-60 minutes
In Granada, one of the most impressive building projects of the Middle Ages has begun: the construction of Alhambra. A palace, fortress, and a small city -- all-in-one -- Alhambra is made up of the world’s most beautiful gardens, pavilions, chambers and towers.The most prominent builders in all of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skills in building Alhambra. Employ the most talented teams of builders to construct your Alhambra. Hire stonemasons from the north and gardeners from the south, who all want a fair wage and insist on being paid with their native currency. With their help, towers can be constructed, gardens designed, pavilions and mezzanines erected, and manors and royal chambers built. Compete against your opponents to build the greatest and most impressive Alhambra.

**
In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex. On a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s turn, a player may take money from the open money market, purchase a building from the building market, or engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn. Players with the most buildings in each of the seven building types score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; longest external _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wall_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.
Expanded by:
-Alhambra: The Vizier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Favor
-Alhambra: The City Gates
-Alhambra: Thief_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Turn

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG 60367)
Gold Edition
The golden anniversary edition version of the 2003 Spiel des Jahres offers new game material. This includes wooden fountains and an embroidered cloth bag, adding more atmosphere to the game! This is a perfect gift for fans of Alhambra! The material is completely compatible with all the published expansions. Granada, 1278. At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting projects of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of Alhambra. Experience, over the course of the game, determines how the construction of this Spanish wonder takes place. The game is easy to learn: just a few rules and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re ready to play. Each round, you must decide: Do you take a currency note, so that later on you can acquire a valuable piece of the Palace - a Pavilion or a Manor for example? Or do you purchase one of the available Palace pieces to expand your Alhambra? Be careful as you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t receive any change. However, if you can pay the exact amount, you will get another turn immediately! During the scoring rounds, you will receive Victory Points for having the majority of any type of palace piece. But that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not the only way to score points: the longer your City Wall, the more protected your Alhambra will be, earning you additional points. Great for 2 players. </notes>

    <notes>Description: 
Alhambra has three main components: the currency deck and draw piles, the building tiles and market, and each player has an Alhambra and tile reserve board. 
The currency deck is constructed at the beginning of the game by first giving each player their starting money (turn over cards until the sum is equal to or greater than 20 with the player with the lowest sum as the starting player), and then dividing into 5 equal piles, inserting the first scoring card in the second pile and the second scoring card in the fourth pile, and finally re-stacking the five piles with the fifth stack on the bottom. Four cards are turned over to form the currency draw piles. 
The building tiles (all tiles except the 6 Alhambra starting tiles) are mixed and put in the bag. Four tiles are drawn at random and placed in the four spaces on the building market board.

    <notes>BRAND NEW IN PUBLISHER_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S SHRINKWRAP!
This is the new, low square box, edition, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Queen multilingual edition 2011_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
SHIPPING:
   USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played four times.
This game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards have been sleeved.
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>
