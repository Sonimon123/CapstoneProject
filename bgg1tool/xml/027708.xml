   <description>From the author:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

1960: MAKING OF A PRESIDENT
In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of John F. Kennedy or Richard Nixon vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pocket books in mind. 
The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960 - a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s late endorsement, and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Catholic question_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves. 
As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing (90 minutes) strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.
Contents: 1 Game board, 108 cards, 150 wooden support cubes, 2 Candidate pawns, 50 State seals, 12 Momentum markers, 8 Endorement markers, 3 Issues marker, 2 wooden Turn/Phase cubes
No. of players: 2

Designed by Christian Leonhard and Jason Matthews
All elections are turning points, but the presidential election of 1960 holds a special place in American history. The 1950s had been a period of unparalleled economic growth and US global power. Richard Nixon served as President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Vice President through most of the period. Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s humble origins gave him a common touch that appealed to the small town, idyllic America encompassed by the spirit of the 1950s. John F. Kennedy, was Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mirror image: charming, Harvard educated and the scion of an American political dynasty. Kennedy challenged Americans to confront the uncertainties and tumult that were already emerging in 1960. He set his vision not in the past, but on new frontiers.
In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying to lead America through an era of turbulent change. The candidates must contend with all the great issues of the day, from the Cold War to civil rights to voters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pocket books. This is an election that will turn on positioning and momentum. The contest is fought on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s late endorsement, and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Catholic question_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; are all specific event cards. The famous televised debates are also an important component of gameplay.
As with a real election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to relive the most significant political contest of the Twentieth Century. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both

    <notes>1960 The making of the president.  This copy has been played maybe twice.  It is in excellent shape and is complete.  Actually, this one is better than complete.  Because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also added 30 extra blue and 30 extra red cubes to the number of cubes that came with the game.  So you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never run out.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7019)
Designed by Christian Leonhard and Jason Matthews
All elections are turning points, but the presidential election of 1960 holds a special place in American history. The 1950s had been a period of unparalleled economic growth and US global power. Richard Nixon served as President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Vice President through most of the period. Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s humble origins gave him a common touch that appealed to the small town, idyllic America encompassed by the spirit of the 1950s. John F. Kennedy, was Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mirror image: charming, Harvard educated and the scion of an American political dynasty. Kennedy challenged Americans to confront the uncertainties and tumult that were already emerging in 1960. He set his vision not in the past, but on new frontiers.
In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying to lead America through an era of turbulent change. The candidates must contend with all the great issues of the day, from the Cold War to civil rights to voters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pocket books. This is an election that will turn on positioning and momentum. The contest is fought on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s late endorsement, and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Catholic question_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; are all specific event cards. The famous televised debates are also an important component of gameplay.
As with a real election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to relive the most significant political contest of the Twentieth Century. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both

3) Henry Luce: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;any region_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; was changed to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;any single region_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.

14) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;two or more cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; replaces _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;two cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
15) instruction to discard Debate Event cards (under Debate Events) removed
16) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Each player may resolve their cards in any order desired._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; added to Campaign Strategy section

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7019)
All elections are turning points, but the presidential election of 1960 holds a special place in American history. The 1950s had been a period of unparalleled economic growth and US global power. Richard Nixon served as President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Vice President through most of the period. Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s humble origins gave him a common touch that appealed to the small town, idyllic America encompassed by the spirit of the 1950s. John F. Kennedy, was Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mirror image: charming, Harvard educated and the scion of an American political dynasty. Kennedy challenged Americans to confront the uncertainties and tumult that were already emerging in 1960. He set his vision not in the past, but on new frontiers.
In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying to lead America through an era of turbulent change. The candidates must contend with all the great issues of the day, from the Cold War to civil rights to voters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pocket books. This is an election that will turn on positioning and momentum. The contest is fought on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s late endorsement, and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Catholic question_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; are all specific event cards. The famous televised debates are also an important component of gameplay.
As with a real election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to relive the most significant political contest of the Twentieth Century. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both

1960 MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 1ST EDITION: $39.95
Z-Man Games [ZMG 7042]
Game is in overall _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Condition, but has been downgrated to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because 3 cards have a faint crease in them.  The crease is very hard to see (notes the pictures below) -- but you can feel in when you run your fingers over the 3 cards in question.

    <notes>The lower left front corner is a little smushed. That is the only problem with the game. Everything is unpunched and the cards are still in original shrinkwrap. It is very close to being rated _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
If you choose to send a personal check, money order, or cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check, we will have to wait for it to clear before I send the game.</notes>

    <notes>It pains me to part with these games, but I was recently in a pretty bad car accident and my vehicle was totaled. I am trying to raise some money to get a new car, public transportation in my area is not very good and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get me to many of the places I need to go.
This is for a once played copy of 1960. I personally feel that the game is nearly _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition, but I wanted to err on the side of caution so I have marked is as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead. Everything is in great shape. Shipping will cost $12.</notes>

    <notes>The box has mild wear, but the components are in excellent condition. 
Only played twice!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also looking to trade!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to get a different game, so my preference is to trade this for an amazon gift card so I can turn around and buy a different game without paying a processing fee outside of BGG commission.
Alternate option: Buy me a copy of Grand Austria Hotel form amazon and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay the commission and shipping for 1960. US only.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Opened but unpunched and unplayed. Box and contents are in like new condition with no apparent wear.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a medium to large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>My husband was a game collector. He passed away in 2012, it is time to find new homes for all of his games. He never allowed eating or drinking around his games. They come from a smoke free home. Most of his games were never played. I try to be honest about the condition.</notes>

    <notes>Please note:   Blocks and candidate  cylinders  are from the 2017 GMT version--  but this is cosmetic only.  This game includes the two cylinders for each candidate form the GMT edition.  
All components are in excellent to near-mint condition--only the box show wear.  
This is the Zman 2nd edition of the game, so the rulebook is updated from  the original printing.</notes>

    <notes>Game is, unfortunately, showing its age - bought it off eBay, and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear to have been well-stored by previous owner; box and components are worn, but all components are present and in tact.  
The playing cards (the core of the game) are in good condition, with no marks or wear around the edges. The cardboard tokens within the game have fared less well, and look a little water-stained. This doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t impact play at all. The board and box both feel and look a little worn. 
Due to the condition, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking for £7.00 in total to cover postage, packing and transaction costs. Shipping on this item will be free within the UK. 
Basically, this is a very well designed game which just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for us - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it to go to a good home, but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want anyone else to be disappointed, as we were, by its condition!</notes>
