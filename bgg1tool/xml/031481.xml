   <description>In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Only played twice, everything is in excellent shape.  This is the RGG reprint of the game.  Comes with two complete card decks (not sure why) although only one is needed to play the game.  Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!

Game Description: 
Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction firm that builds sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy. For years, Corp Inc. has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business.
The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free?
That’s where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fl y it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profi ts you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery.
It’s possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and fi nish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO A08)
Type: Economic 
Number of players: 2-4
Age of players: 10++
Length: 60 minutes minutes
Game Description: 
Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction fi rm that builds sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy. For years, Corp Inc. has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business.
The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free?
That’s where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fl y it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profi ts you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery.
It’s possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and fi nish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIOA08)
Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction firm that builds sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy. For years, Corp Inc. has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business. The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free? That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fly it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profi ts you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and finish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy! </notes>

    <notes>Galaxy Trucker for Sale. I bought the game new in November 2012 and have played exactly 3 times with my girlfriend. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a great game (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve read the reviews), but not our cup of tea. All game pieces and instructions are in perfect condition and accounted for. The only wear and tear I could find are a few minor creases in the instruction manual and on 2 corners of the game box (see pictures). Feel free to ask any questions about the game or the condition of my copy for sale. </notes>

    <notes>------------------------------------------------
This listing is for Rob M (Robandstuff) only.
------------------------------------------------
This is a copy of Galaxy Trucker and also Galaxy Trucker: The Big Expansion.  The expansion has been combined into the base game box and I got rid of the unnecessary expansion box years ago, so there is only one box for the two items together.
The box is somewhat damaged.  The top is a bit bowed and the corners are a little ripped (so have been shored up with tape as you can see in the photos below).  The contents are completely fine, including all of the tiles, cards, and other bits.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included three photos below to show the box, but just let me know if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested and want me to take more photos.  Because of the box damage, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve tried to set a reasonable price.  I see that the base game plus expansion sell for about $80 online, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge just $50 for the two together.
I can accept PayPal or a personal check.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>*NOTE* MUST also buy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Big Expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from me since the expansion is in the same box.
Played a few times but lovingly cared for. Includes colored baggies for player pieces and two plano cases for storing your pieces (see picture).  Minor shelf wear (see picture to see the worst two corners of the box).  100% complete.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

Graded _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for creases to box, slightly torn box corner, whitening to edges.  In other words, the box is solid, but shows obvious wear.  Most of the components look VG or better.  The playing boards do have a little whitening to the edges.  This is an obviously played game.</notes>

    <notes>Box solid, but with mild shelfwear and some bowing. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the first edition box, not the later RGG one. Other components in great shape. It has the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;replacement_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tiles and cards offered by Rio Grande, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fully compatible with the expansions. I also have the original first edition components, if you want them (would add some weight, of course).
Shipping should be for a 4 pound box, but possibly 5. I ship via USPS, FedEx, or UPS, depending on the rate and your preference.
Let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIOA08)
Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction firm that builds sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy. For years, Corp Inc. has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business. The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free? That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fly it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profits you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and finish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!</notes>

    <notes>Very minimal wear on tiles.  All components organized and bagged within original insert.  Smaller components stored within plastic Plano-style organizer within box.
Selling because we enjoyed the game so much in our few initial plays that the Anniversary Edition is incoming, so we no longer have a need for the original.
Ships from Arlington, VA (22204) via lowest-cost insurable, trackable method of USPS Standard, USPS Priority, or UPS.
Shipping box dimensions:  14_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x14_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, weight approx. 4 lbs. 11 oz.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIOA08)
Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction firm that builds sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy. For years, Corp Inc. has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business. The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there are nut-cases who will do it for free? That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access to a Corp Inc. Warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated components, and fly it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss, but any profits you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay you a bonus for quick delivery. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and finish your days panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!</notes>

    <notes>This is the first edition which has been upgraded via the upgrade pack to the second edition.  Some of the components are thicker, and the second edition ships have blunted noses, and are non-lethal.  Both the original and upgraded ships are included.
This set was played about four times.  The components are in excellent shape, but the box has some minor rubbing wear, mostly whiting along the box edges.
Shipping from 98685.  This game will fit into a medium flat rate box.</notes>

SHIPPING: I estimate between $9.85 and $13.60 for USPS Priority, but we can discuss other carriers if you like. I can ship within 2 business days of payment clearing. If you live near Pittsburgh, we can make an arrangement to hand-off and avoid shipping costs altogether. I am happy to combine shipping should you have an interest in other items of mine, just let me know!
PAYMENT: Payment is via Paypal, Popmoney, or Venmo. I will also accept a USPS money order.</notes>
