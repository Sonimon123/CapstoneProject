   <description>Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;time_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;time_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; to catch up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Jenseits von Theben_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Number of players: 2-4
Age of players: 10+
Length: 45-60 minutes
Game Description: 
In this game, the players travel back to the end of the 19th century to take on the roles of the famous archaeologists who discovered so much in so short a time. The names Schliemann, Evans, Carter, and Koldeway are still famous today. Like those they seek to emulate, the players seek to discover those antique treasures and places which have been buried in the sands for thousands of years.Each player take the role of an archaeologist. They first travel across Europe to find useful knowledge of different archaeological areas and then they excavate at places they expect to find treasures. The players score points for discoveries at these locations. Also, the players can acquire articles to assist them in excavation and travel, and will visit exhibitions to present their finds.

The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

The only component issue to note is one of the player wheels, for estimating the dig, came with a clasp that was to small. The wheel still works but not as efficiently as it should.

Game Description: 
In this game, the players travel back to the end of the 19th century to take on the roles of the famous archaeologists who discovered so much in so short a time. The names Schliemann, Evans, Carter, and Koldeway are still famous today. Like those they seek to emulate, the players seek to discover those antique treasures and places which have been buried in the sands for thousands of years.Each player take the role of an archaeologist. They first travel across Europe to find useful knowledge of different archaeological areas and then they excavate at places they expect to find treasures. The players score points for discoveries at these locations. Also, the players can acquire articles to assist them in excavation and travel, and will visit exhibitions to present their finds. </notes>

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG 60461)
Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.</notes>

    <notes>There there is a major ding in the form of a 2-inch crush/pinch on the bottom right corner of the box--it affects the box top and bottom. I will send pictures on request.
The game is in otherwise perfect condition; the shrink has been removed and the contents examined to ensure that the ding did not affect any game components.

    <notes>Private sale for auction winner (okami31)
Quoted shipping is for Parcel Post. Priority Mail will run $20 because of the odd box size Queen Games likes to use and flat-rate boxes won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit.
Let me know which shipping auction you want and when this is confirmed I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send over a PayPal invoice.

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG60461F)
In this game, the players travel back to the end of the 19th century to take on the roles of the famous archaeologists who discovered so much in so short a time. The names Schliemann, Evans, Carter, and Koldeway are still famous today. Like those they seek to emulate, the players seek to discover those antique treasures and places which have been buried in the sands for thousands of years. Each player takes the role of an archaeologist. They first travel across Europe to find useful knowledge of different archaeological areas and then they excavate at places they expect to find treasures. The players score points for discoveries at these locations. Also, the players can acquire articles to assist them in excavation and travel, and will visit exhibitions to present their finds. </notes>

Payment via PayPal, or cash for local pickup.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of GMT war games and other classic boardgames. </notes>

Condition: (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m conservative with my descriptions so people cannot claim I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dishonest!)  The only wear you can notice on this copy is some light indentations on the bottom of the box, and the English rules have been read a few times.  Otherwise the game is like new.  Complete.  Copies of all rules in all languages provided, though all non-English rules are under the insert.  Bought new and played 2 or 3 times and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it.
Shipping: This will ship via USPS, Regional Rate B or Flat Rate or even regular. My guess is $8-15 to ship, fully insured, depending on how far you are from northern Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders. Bitcoin works too.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMQ060461)
In this game, the players travel back to the end of the 19th century to take on the roles of the famous archaeologists who discovered so much in so short a time. The names Schliemann, Evans, Carter, and Koldeway are still famous today. Like those they seek to emulate, the players seek to discover those antique treasures and places which have been buried in the sands for thousands of years. Each player takes the role of an archaeologist. They first travel across Europe to find useful knowledge of different archaeological areas and then they excavate at places they expect to find treasures. The players score points for discoveries at these locations. Also, the players can acquire articles to assist them in excavation and travel, and will visit exhibitions to present their finds.</notes>

    <notes>The box is well worn, with one side slightly split.
Game has been played a handful of times over the years. Components are in very good condition.
This is a largish box. Unless you are near southern Oregon, shipping will more than likely be in a large, flat-rate USPS box: $18.90</notes>
