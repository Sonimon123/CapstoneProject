   <description>With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;gateway game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Ticket to Ride series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

International orders will incur a $2 handling fee and shipping insurance is mandatory for international addresses.  I will ship game within 1 business day of receiving payment, unless payment is by personal check.  Personal checks will delay shipping by 7-10 business days after check arrives.  I will combine shipping on multiple orders to lower overall shipping charges.

TICKET TO RIDE
October 2, 1900 - 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a £20,000 bet that he could travel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Around the World in 80 Days_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Now at the dawn of the century it was time for a new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;impossible journey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s impetuous and lucrative gamble - and to propose a new wager of their own.
The stakes: $1 Million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see which of them can travel by rail to the most cities in North America - in just 7 days. The journey begins immediately...
Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure where players collect cards of various types of train cars that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America.

October 2, 1900 - 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a £20,000 bet that he could travel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Around the World in 80 Days_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Now at the dawn of the century it was time for a new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;impossible journey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s impetuous and lucrative gamble - and to propose a new wager of their own.
The stakes: $1 Million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see which of them can travel by rail to the most cities in North America - in just 7 days. The journey begins immediately...
Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure where players collect cards of various types of train cars that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America.</notes>

    <notes>Days of Wonder - Ticket To Ride
Language: Dutch
Players: 2 to 5 
Weight: 1.300 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in 3 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed – adding more cards to your hand, and fear – losing a critical route to a competitor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.

    <notes>Hi there!
Up for sale is Ticket to Ride + 1910 Expansion. I have limited closet space and need to sell some games. These are games that are in near-new condition, played only once, and just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t click with my gaming group. They come from a smoke-free, adult home with no kids and no pets. I take absolute meticulous care of all my board games. I do not allow friends to eat and drink while playing these games. Hopefully they can find a home in your inventory where they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be played and loved :)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGG, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much feedback, but you can check my eBay account (x.metal), which has over 820 feedback with no negatives. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping for multiple items.
Send me a geekmail if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink. 
You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>This listing is for the first printing of Ticket to Ride. It has been played several times.  Everything is in good shape.  The cards in this printing are the smaller cards.  They have been used so there is a little chipping as the first printing had black borders.  I am also including the 1910 expansion which looks brand new.  The cards are in perfect shape.  They are the larger cards so you do not need to worry about the older smaller cards.  There is no box for the 1910 expansion and it is in the main TTR box.
I will ship via USPS Priority Mail so shipping is $11.</notes>

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>I have a copy of the 1910 Expansion (here: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1314865) that I think should accompany a purchase of this game. The base game cards are small; the expansion fixes that and adds other play modes!
The game is in really good condition. No visible marks or dings anywhere. I just know we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it quite a few times and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not comfortable trying to list it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;</notes>

    <notes>Played many times but components are all in good shape. Only reason I put good instead of very good is because the cards are clearly used. Probably not a big deal because the 1910 expansion would fix it right up with its larger replacement cards.</notes>
