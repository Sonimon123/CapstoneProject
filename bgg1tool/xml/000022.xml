   <description>From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Complete, unpunched (mostly--some of the character cards are separated from each other), and in excellent condition.  The box has no split corners, and just a small dent on the cover.  The second edition rulebook is included.  Also included is a copy of The General Vol 16 #4, which has a lot of MR material.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also consider trades.  This is ready to ship immediately--I had boxed it up for another sale, but the buyer backed out.  Feel free to offer trades as well--you can take a look at my want list.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling this game as-is, even though I bought it as complete.  There are a million counters so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible but unlikely one is missing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think any are, but I wanted the buyer to know.  The game box has seen some wear, but all components are in good condition.  Shipping is calculated based on where you live. I can send it via Priority Mail if you live in the US. Feel free to ask questions!

    <notes>Game is complete, except for one magic chit for the druid, easily replaced. (I might even replace it with one from my personal game.) Box is beat, lid split in several places but is still basically intact. All the pieces have been ziplocked. Character cards and pieces are individually ziplocked. Except for that one piece, game is complete. Except for the box and lid, game is in very good shape.</notes>

    <notes>Rulesbook:  The cover has come loose from the pages.  There is some marking in the rulebook but none of it covers any of the text (someone put some boxes around the main rules.  It might actually be helpful!).
I printed out the 2nd edition rules that some fans did a few years ago.  I just checked the Geek and you can now download the 3rd edition rules.  But what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got printed is 2nd edition.  I also printed out some expansion rules which I believe originally came from the General magazine years ago and someone converted them to a text document.
All 20 of the board tiles are present! and in good shape.
All 16 of the character sheets are present!  Someone even laminated them! nice!
The spell _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the treasures are all these small square cards and very fuzzy since the original owner needed to separate them along the perforation.  They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in great shape and tied together.  I guess I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m making a comment on the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original quality here.
The player aid pad is here! Seems to have most if not all of it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pages.
There are 2 white dice.  I remember the original game coming with 1 white and 1 red so somewhere along the way the red die got replaced.
The character counters are all together in a baggie.
The monster tokens are all there but loose in the box.
The treasure setup card is there.
Please ask me anymore questions if you have them.</notes>

    <notes>Practically untouched: virtually all the counters are still unpunched. The only damage is to the box lid: three of the four corners have separated with age (despite careful storage) and there is very mild creasing showing on the top right corner, otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be able to rate it Very Good to Like New! I can provide photos of any part(s) you need in order to make your decision.
I have a few articles from the AH General about the game that I will either include in the box or send separately to the buyer for free. (I have to go through my game file first!)</notes>

Magic Realm by Avalon Hill
All parts have been inventoried and all are in good shape with very little wear. Many of the character chits are unused and still attached to each other. No parts are missing.
The Personal History Sheet pad has lots of sheets remaining.
The SPELL cards are still unpunched; the TREASURE cards have been separated.
The box of this copy is in much better shape, although the lid does have two split corners. The bottom is intact and in good shape.
All parts are organized and bagged. A copy of errata and an inventory sheet will be included.
Shipping will be $10 for USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation. Insurance is option for $2.30.</notes>

    <notes>In very good condition. Game is punched, but is 100% complete, including rule book, game pad, chart, spell card, treasure cards, major and minor counters. I verified the counter totals against the sacns of the counter sheets on the Geek. It is deinitely complete. The game pad doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even appear to be missing any sheets (I inherited this game, so I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be 100% sure of that, though). The only flaw with this copy is that the box corner of the lid of the box is split on the top left hand corner. But the game components are all in excellent shape.</notes>

    <notes>I acquired two copies of Magic Realm at the same time, so I am selling this second copy.
All the contents and pieces have been verified and are complete, including all the chits and counters. This copy comes with the 1st edition rules (the 2nd edition, which is recommended, is available for download on the Geek).
The chits and counters are in superb condition, equal to those in my other copy, which was unpunched. The character cards are also in excellent condition, as are the treasure and spell cards.
The map tiles are very faintly worn at the edges, but the faces are in excellent, clean condition. The treasure set up card and the rulebook are faintly browned with age, but still quite presentable. The personal history pad has a number of unused pages left, and there are a ton of photocopies included in the box. The box itself is torn at the four corners, and has some shelf wear. There is some Scotch tape on the bottom of the box, which I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t dare remove, because the box bottom is made of a grained paper which could easily tear.
There are two plastic containers included for storing the counters and chits.
There is no detectable tobacco smoke or mildew odor in the box, and all the pieces are clean and free of stains and blemishes. Although it was obviously played, it has been well-treated, and the counters especially are in perfect condition.
Domestic and international shipping are calculated by weight, and I charge only at cost. I think you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll agree that insurance is a necessity for this baby.
Please take a look at the images for details about the condition of the contents, and for further information please feel free to contact me.</notes>

    <notes>An unpunched, unplayed copy of Magic Realm.
Box has minimal (if any) signs of shelf wear, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably as close to new as you can get out of its original shrink.
As you can see the majority of the character cards are still attached to each other.  The spell card sheet is whole.  Instruction booklet is perfect and the pad is unused.  The chits (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s folded kind of weird and not exactly neatly, but there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no damage to the counters themselves) and terrain tiles are unpunched (although a couple have fallen out).  Two dice are included.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never played this game but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably as close to a new copy as you can get for a vintage game like Magic Realm.
Postage is $10 and insurance is extra.  International shipping will be more depending on the destination.</notes>

Includes lots of supplemental material such as copied articles from GENERAL magazine, a few GENERALS with longer articles on strategy, and other assorted print-outs.
Third edition rules are available as a download from BGG. Please do not attempt to play using the first edition rules included, they are truly dreadful rules!
Contact me about shipping costs -- this is a heavy game, what with all the extras I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m throwing in! Insurance is not necessary, but is recommended.

    <notes>I was a boardgame collector in the Eighties, but have not played in the last fifteen years. I never bought used items, I only bought them new in the shop. I played MAGIC REALM only once. All items are still included. The board pieces are in MINT condition ase are the counters. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal History Pad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is NOT used. The Rulebook would be MINT, but there are a few red scratches on a table on the last side. There is also a slight spot on the Set Up Card (unfortunately this causes the rubber I used to get some items togehter) - otherwise it is mint. Shipping: Germany 6 Euro. EU in Europe: 17 Euro. Rest of Europe: 30 Euro. USA, Canada: 35 Euro. Rest of the World: 40 Euro. International Paying per PayPal, in Europe and Germany bank transfer too - auch per Überweisung. Perfekt erhaltene Ausgabe von MAGIC REALM mit allen Bestandteilen. Wurde von mir damals neu im Laden gekauft und wie ein rohes Ei behandelt. Doch leider hatte ich die Bestandteile in Plastiktütchen verpackt und diese mit Gummis gesichert, die porös wurden und sowohl am sonst makellosen Regelheft (nur auf der letzten Seite) als auch  am großen Sheet festklebten, wo sie leichte (rote) Flecken hinterließen. Sonst ist alles, als wäre es eben NEU gekauft worden!</notes>

Box is showing age - bubbling a bit here and there, has one split corner and is slightly bowed on top.

    <notes>First edition.
Downgraded to Acceptable only because of the box.  The bottom is structurally intact, but the top has two split corners and a lot of general wear and scuffing.
The contents are unplayed and still in great condition.  The Personal History Pad is unused.  The hexes and characters have been separated, but all the counters are still unpunched, save for a few rows that fell out on their own.  Those have been counted and all contents are verified 100% complete.</notes>

    <notes>This 2nd Edition copy has barely been played.  All pieces are present, including the character log, which has a majority of the pages remaining.  Only damages are that the box has some damage from masking tape from moving, a few dents from other games resting on top of it, the rulebook is missing the cover (No rules are missing), and a little from age.
Shipping will be calculated upon purchase, however it was estimated to be about $12 UPS standard shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but partially unpunched.  The character cards and the tiles have been separated, but the spell sheet and the counter chits are still in their original state.  Contents are complete and have not been used.  The box does show shelf wear for a vintage game but has no tears or splits.
Domestic shipping will be $10-$13 (estimate due to its irregular size).  Insurance of up to $100 is free via FedEx if you can provide a business address to ship to, otherwise it is at the cost of the buyer.  International rate depends on the destination.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and complete.  Although the box has moderate shelf wear, this copy is unpunched.  The character cards have not been entirely separated; the spell, terrain and counter sheets are still in their original state.  The contents are in really good condition.  This has the 1st edition rule book (the blue one).
Domestic shipping is estimated around $10.  Insurance of up to $100 is provided if you can supply a business address to use with FedEx, otherwise it is at the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense.  International rate depends on the destination.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve bought half a dozen copies of various quality components-two very good boxes and the rest to sort. I have 3 to sell;
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; $116.66
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; $99.78

Obviously the 2 VG boxes go with A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;B. I have the reference DVD too to augment the packages.All will be verified complete. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Cool_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; blue and white dice replace the originals. Found an excellent use for these little plastic boxes I have;containers for those treasure cards (see pic)
OLD AD COPY WHEN I HAD BUT 2;Unpunched but has considerable signs of aging. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got the sheet of little cards in a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;false top_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; made up from a MR box cover (see pics). The 2 sheets of counters are unpunched. I have one set of 19 hex tiles and another dozen and will merge them and select the best 20. The 19 came with the unpunched set so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in fine shape. As are the black character cards - I placed the two sets side by side for each character and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a noticeable difference between the unplayed and played with. You get the unplayed. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to take that large chart and have color copies made at office depot and whatever I can do to support this game. Rules look read and have moderate to heavy usage characteristics. The unpunched copy rule_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s were obviously used with play in other sets. I have the reference DVD yet to look at to see what extras I can include.Ask.</notes>

Some of the unpunched sheets I have have storage wear, i.e. the color has faded from shifting abrasions. Thus I go to my punched pool and use punched. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve handled about 8-10 copies of MR and still have about 3-4 games worth of components. Only one of which appeasr to have seen heavy play.

    <notes>The game box is in very good condition.  Nice color, one corner is dinged and the inside box at that spot has the beginnings of a split.
Game material in very good condition, lots of unused character sheets.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve reviewed the cards and tiles to verify they are all present but have not inventoried every counter.  See note below about the collection.
Shipping will be $12 to Eastern and Central US and $13 to Pacific and Mountain.  Other locations please inquire.
Note:  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game on behalf of a friend whose father recently passed and who had a remarkable collection of games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting in coming weeks.  There are too many games in this collection for me to meticulously inventory beyond just a basic review but I have no reason to expect any problems with these games as I personally know they have been very well cared for the last 20+ years (generally all the games in this collection are lightly played).  Other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting from this collection include:  Outpost, Magic Realm, Divine Right, Gunslinger, Merchant of Venus, The Lonely Mountain, Sword and Sorcery, Talisman, and nearly 30 others so please ask if there is something else you are looking for from this era as I might actually have it.</notes>

Almost everything is in excellent condition. There are a handful of counters which show wear. They were popular counters, such as the heavy axe and dwarf, so they were used a lot.

    <notes>The game components are in like new condition.  It was played about 4 times (14 personal history pads have been used) when I purchased it when it first came out and it has been in storage ever since.  The box is in good condition although he has some shelf wear and a small tear in the paper on one side, and I managed to split a corner when I was opening it up to take photos for this...
Shipping will be my exact cost.  I will most likely ship usps flat rate box.</notes>

    <notes>This is Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s First Edition of Magic Realm (with the blue cover rulebook). All the game components are present and they are in crisp, clean, like new condition (with the exception that 3 sheets were removed from the Personal History pad on the one attempt I made to play this game).
The box does show some wear from 30+ years of storage in my game closet including some slight creasing (see photos). However, it is completely sound with all corners intact.(no tape).</notes>

    <notes>English version.
All items are really on stock. No fake set-up here. No Order on demand.
International Customers, our precise shipping costs are as follows:
DHL International Shipping: Zone 1 (Mostly Europe): 15,00€+1,00€ per two kilos
Shipping costs can vary greatly after that and have to be asked for individually.
We ship only fully insured. So ordering only a small pocket game or anything very low priced may come out to be very uneconomical.
Methods of payment:
-You can always pick the game up at our storage location :-)
-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use paypal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)
Für unsere deutschsprachigen Kunden:
Sie können uns für alle Fragen gerne telefonisch kontaktieren:
Tel.: 0201-786877
Die Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschlands betragen 5,- Euro (inkl. 19% Mwst.). Ab 100€ versenden wir innerhalb Deutschlands Versandkostenfrei.
Alle Preise enthalten die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer in Höhe von 19%.
Bezahlmöglichkeiten für Kunden innerhalb Deutschlands:
- Alle Kreditkarten willkommen !
- Paypal
- Vorkasse
- Rechnung (Nicht für Erstbesteller, wir behalten uns vor die Zahlungsmöglichkeit per Rechnung von Fall zu Fall neu zu bewerten !)
 
Alternativ ist natürlich auch eine Abholung mit Bar-, EC-, oder Kreditkartenzahlung in unserem Lager möglich. (Im Geschäft wird neben Brettspielen auch eine üppige Auswahl an Rollenspielen angeboten.)
Beachten Sie bitte auch unsere Aktionen und weiter Angebote auf: www. fanen.com
Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie können Ihre Vertragserklärung innerhalb von zwei Wochen ohne Angabe von Gründen in Textform (z. B. Brief oder E-Mail),
oder durch Rücksendung der Sache widerrufen. 
Die Frist beginnt frühestens mit Erhalt dieser Belehrung.
Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist genügt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs oder der Sache. 
Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:
Fantasy En_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Counter c/o Holger Willert
Gudulastr. 5 D(Hofgebäude rechts hinten) 
45131 Essen
email: fanen@fanen.com
Widerrufsfolgen
Im Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren. 
Können Sie uns die empfangene Leistung ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurückgewähren,
müssen Sie uns insoweit ggf. Wertersatz leisten. 
Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung - wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre - zurückzuführen ist. 
Im Übrigen können Sie die Wertersatzpflicht vermeiden, 
indem Sie die Sache nicht wie ein Eigentümer in Gebrauch nehmen und alles unterlassen, was deren Wert beeinträchtigt. 
Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, w
enn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt,
oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung,
oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. 
Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. 
Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. 
Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung erfüllen.

    <notes>2nd Edition. Components are complete and in excellent condition.  Many character sheets still on the pad.  The box has a lot of shelf wear (which is why it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s listed as Acceptable condition), but the corners are not split.   This is a one-owner game, not a thrift-store find or ebay purchase.</notes>

    <notes>2nd Edition - COMPLETE GAME
Box top is solid, shows whitening around edges.
Box bottom has had some splits and been repaired with tape.
Components show significant wear.  This game has been played a lot.
Owner did a complete inventory (I am selling for a friend).  Monsters in one bag; denizens and weapons in one bag; each character in a bag.  Game includes 6 player sheets.
Rule book is complete, but cover has come loose from the rest of the manual.
Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, not for a collector.

    <notes>Good condition.  The box has a good bit of wear, as you would expected from a 30 year old game.  All components are present and are packed away neatly in storage containers.  
The game has been opened, punched, and played once. 
In addition to the game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m providing all supplemental material I printed including the 3rd Edition Rules, the Book of Quests (300+ pages), and a few other rules cheat sheets.
International sales are acceptable (shipping costs will apply).
The buyer must specify which shipping method they would like me to use and pay the full shipping cost. Use 77845 as the US zipcode shipping origin.
Paypal is the preferred payment handler (I will consider other means as well).
PM if you have any questions, thanks.</notes>

    <notes>I am classing this as very good because of the extras.
The box is reasonable - it shows signs of shelf wear but is not crushed like so many AH flat boxes became...
The counters are bagged and complete.
The extras:
This has the original first edition and original second edition rules - I remember sending off for them with great excitement when they were first published.
There is a copy of The Avalon Hill GENERAL vol 16 No 4 - the issue that contains all the errata.
I will also send the purchaser all of the articles mention in the More Info section of this game BGG entry.</notes>

    <notes>First edition with a photocopy of second edition rules.
The game is not new; in fact, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s almost fourty years old. The box gave way on the corners which were reinforced with transparent tape and shows some expected scuff on the edges, but is in surprisingly good shape (better than a lot of my modern game boxes). One character card has some abrasion marks on the black background and one has a slight bend mark - other than that the game looks unplayed to my eyes.
Unfortunately, this not being published by FFG, the rulebook doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t specify exact  numbers of all components  and, having no experience with it upon release due to not being born, I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be sure that nothing is missing, although judging by how it was cared for, I suspect not. From what I was able to gather, at least all character cards, tiles, spells and treasures are present. Of the hero advencement sheet close to one hundered remain.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like me to check anything or need additional photos, please let me know; I am afraid image upload doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t work here with ios. I accept returns and will take your word for any discrepancies discovered.</notes>

    <notes>Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s as complete an inventory as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to make! Box top has wear and 3 split corners but bottom is sound. Rules in great condition. 6 Personal History Pads have been laminated; a large stack of pads is still unmarked. Chits have not been counted but were bagged quite meticulously. There are sealed envelopes labeled Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Dwarf, Elf, Woods Girl, Witch-King, Witch, Swordsman, Captain, Magician, White Knight, Black Knight, Berserker, Amazon, and Pilgrim. Each contains the player card and chits appropriate to that character. There are 18 large hexagonal board tiles, bagged, for the map. There are 2 dice, one white and one red. The bottom of the box contains a large set-up card that takes up the entire bottom.
Separate from the main box is a 3-ring binder titled _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Magic Realm: Book of Learning: A Tutorial to Help the Dauntless Gamer Survive the Perils of the Magic Realm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a color-printed 150 pg guide to the game, written by a third party named Jay Richardson. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all I can tell you! It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a copy I would happily pick up if I wanted to play the game but obviously not one for a meticulous collector.
Buyer pays actual shipping from 37919 + $2 in Paypal fees if any are incurred. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll accept whatever payment method works (ask beforehand for odd requests), including FEELESS Paypal friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; family payments.

    <notes>Game is over 40 years old, the box shows some wear and tear, but over all good condition
My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He loved his games!  He kept them in great condition, and they were treated with kid gloves.  If they were played, no food or drink were allowed around the games, some games he even made us wear gloves to play :)   He passed away 4 years ago and it is time to find new homes for the game</notes>

treasure set up card- a bit  worn but fully readable

treasure and spell cards - all present and counted
as for the minor counters, they are hundreds and should be all present, 
however they are mostly interchangeable and should a few be missing, playability would not be impaired.
In case you go through with the order, I could count every single piece.
The game includes two free extras: a photocopy of the second edition rules and a set of Q_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A printed in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the General_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.</notes>

    <notes>This is a copy that has been played and wants to be played more; not for the collector.  The box is pretty wrecked.  Each character card is bagged with its counters.  Other counters are also bagged.  The land tiles are in good shape.  The rulebook is quite good, but has been highlighted throughout.  The game has a slight mustiness to it, not unusual given its age.  I believe it is complete, but I have not bothered to count every counter.  If you have questions, please ask before purchasing!</notes>

    <notes>My late husband collected board games.  Didn’t always play all of them, but he loved to collect. Time to find new homes for the games.  He took excellent care of his games, and if they were played, no food or drinks were allowed near  the game playing area.  
Overall good condition, considering the age :)</notes>

Game includes first edition rules.  Game is missing some warning chits which were replaced with paper counters.  All other game pieces are in very good condition and inventoried. Box is in good condition but has split corners due to age.  Small components are stored in plastic game boxes for easy access and setup.

    <notes>verified complete, appears lightly played if at all (record pad is full), 16 cards are like new, rules booklet appears unread. I completed punching out most of the counters because i had some better condition punched so when i merged the sets I exacto cut off most of them to ziplock bag by type/shape/color etc. The game will come to you highly organized _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; labeled. Also too I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m aware of the couple of distinctions between versions so you will receive the most current counters ( 2or 3 are slightly different from earlier prints. decent box too which is very difficult to find for this title</notes>

Game parts in great shape. Box a bit worn from its age. Non Smoking home.  I am looking for someone that will play and give it a good home.</notes>

    <notes>A complete and total DIY build of Magic Realm. This is a complete build from Chakroun Karim_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s staggering and definitive redesign.
Lovingly built, printed to a high quality and assembled on very thick cardstock, this is my proudest DIY build.
There are literally 100s of bits, all bagged or sorted into pill boxes. 
Ask any questions, the cost is to recover time and material costs only.
Postage in UK £3, to Europe (about) £10, to USA (about £20 ish).
Game comes with several complete rule sets to dig through, and several pages of notes from my attempts to learn, a process I never completed.
The game has NEVER been played. Every edge is as sharp as when it was cut.

    <notes>decent box, appears lightly played, predominately unpunched (only one of the 16 beige minor counters is punched and more likely just came loose) verified complete, record pad is full, 16 cards are like new, rules booklet (1stEd) appears unread, spell _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; treasure cards are still in a sheet. Most of the unpunched counters I went and punched if some of that particular set/class were already punched. easier to keep organized if I can label a ziplock _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;20 small info_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and put all 20 in a mini zip rather than 6 punched here in this bag and 14 still on the pane. With the variety of counters for this title it gets confusing. I like neat and organized. Also I keep spares and a couple of parts sets for this popular title and compare/contrast each counter set. Often unpunched counters if the game wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stored properly the unpunched counters will be in worse condition than a punched set. My aim is to provide high quality complete used games that get played.</notes>

    <notes>One owner (me). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve recently inventoried the whole box, and the only missing parts I can identify are the dice (2d6 - nothing special), and one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Patter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counter (which I replaced with a handmade version many years ago).
The box is showing it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age.  All the cards and tiles are present. All counters are organized and stored in a tray. 
I really was not able to overcome the learning curve on this one, so it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seen that much use. It spent most of it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time stored in a box. It really is in remarkable condition for an almost 40 year old game. I will provide pictures on request.
Buyer pays shipping, which I will estimate when order is received.</notes>

    <notes>2nd edition rules.  A merger of 2+ sets that has been verified complete. The best components were culled for the sale copy. Counters are excellent with most like new. Now in zip lock and orderly. Very good rules booklet and character cards/ treasure cards. Tiles are fine too. Box is better than average (see pic). Bear in mind what _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;average_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for this title tends to mean; trashed. The game gets played.</notes>

    <notes>Punched , verified complete. very good throughout many pieces appear unused. e. g. spell _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; treasure cards still in a sheet. Game components will come to you highly organized in ziplock bags _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; labeled.  2 rules booklets and 2 personal history pads with perhaps 20% used each. so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have about 1.5 times as many as a new set.Character cards and tiles either very good or like new. Better than average box. To sum up the game components are like new but for the rules and pad and those are doubled</notes>

    <notes>I got this copy at an estate sale, and have kept it safely stored (free from light, dust, and odors) ever since. There is some minor wear and tear along the bottom edge of the box lid, but the contents were very carefully punched and preserved in separate bags. The map tiles all appear mint. There is an original copy of both the First and Second Edition rules, plus a photocopy of the Appendix from AH_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mag. The personal identity (character sheet) pad seems full or nearly full.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve done a complete inventory and please note there is one single piece missing: the Amazon Attention Chit. Every other component is present. I was torn about which Condition to describe this copy as being in. I want to make sure I adhere to BGG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s policy. Please message me if you have any questions.
Sorry for the rather blurry photos!
I will only charge exact shipping, via Priority Mail by weight. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pick up the tab on insurance. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship internationally, but due to mobility issues at present I might have to use International Priority Mail, which would probably be rather pricey, but please inquire if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re curious. As a plus, International Priority would provide insurance and tracking.
I prefer PayPal but if you would like to use a different payment method please ask.
Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>like new 2nd edition rules. Tiles, counters, character cards are like new albeit punched and verified complete. For components that feasibly can be stored in zip lock are after thoughtful, orderly sorting. Spell and treasure cards are still in a single sheet. The best part besides the mint 2ed rules is the fine box. those are damn htf. makes this the BMW of magic realms. the one to buy for play and look good for the ladies</notes>

    <notes>INCOMPLETE read below for details:
Having received the game incomplete, I was looking for any other Magic Realm game to complete mine. Having failed to find an appropriate copy of the game I thought someone might be looking for the exact same thing, so I am selling my copy in order for you to replace some of your old pieces or to fill out missing parts from your game. Or it may be cool to upgrade your base game to make a larger adventure !
Bought this game on ebay and was INCOMPLETE on arrival, missing 22 chits.
Chits missing are:
1x Tremendous monster - Flying Dragon
2x Heavy monster - Giant Bats
1x Heavy monster - Spider
1x Lancer HQ
1x Lancer 1
1x Lancer 2
1x Lancer 3
1x Rogue 1
1x Rogue 2
1x Elf Fight L3
3x swords (think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Broadsword, Devil Sword and 1 on 2 Thrusting Sword)
2x Maces
1x Spear
2x Staffs
1x Helmet
1x Shield
1x Stink W
The box shows some age on corners but is still in shape for it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time spent on earth. The back has a small bump and old tapes mark on sides, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it...
Please send me a message to know exact shipping fees.
NEGOCIABLE once we know shipping fees
