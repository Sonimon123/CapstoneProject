   <description>Louis XIV, by R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;diger Dorn, is about power and influence in the French court at the end of the 17th Century._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players take on the roles of members of the Court, where they carry out their missions and goals at Versailles. By using cards and influence markers, they influence high-ranking Court attendants, such as the King's Mother or one of the countless Royal mistresses. Naturally, the Sun King himself has a special role here too._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;An excellent time and a high level of tension are guaranteed. The final outcome is in doubt right up to the end. Each game is different. A change of pace but still a highly promising strategy game in the finest Alea tradition, one that sits at level 5 on the Alea complexity scale._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Louis XIV Expansion ONLY, not the basic game.
4 Favorite Action Tablets, 1 Favorite Figure
1 Rule Sheet
Everything is in unplayed, New Condition (Open Item)
The expansion consists of one cardboard figure - the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Favorite - and four cardboard tablets, one for all players. And then there is of course a small sheet of new rules.
 
In game setup each player gets a personal Favorite tablet, which has four spaces - one space for each phase of a playing round. Players also take one extra influence marker from the general supply and put it on any space of the Favorite tablet, or to their personal supply.
The favorite figure appears on the board every round opposite of the Sun King in the inner round of the tile table. As the King, the Favorite also rewards a special prize for those who put their influence markers on the tile where he is present at the moment. The King rewarding crown chips, the Favorite gives you extra influence markers. The player with the most markers on the tile where the Favorite is gets two markers from the general supply to be put to their personal supply or favorite tablet, all other players present on the tile gets one. The regular prizes for the tile are also granted according to the normal rules.
With a marker on a space on the Favorite tablet a player may trigger once a corresponding phase a special action. In supply phase players may discard as many influence cards as they wants and replace them with new ones. In Influence phase players may disregard the moving rules and move their just placed influence marker to any tile they want. In scoring phase the Intrigue card gets more power - players may put three markers from their own supply or two markers from the general supply to the tile on which they play their Intrigue card. And finally, in the mission phase the players may keep up to three mission tokens to the next round instead of the normal one.
When triggering the special action from the Favorite tablet the influence marker on the corresponding space is returned to the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s personal supply. Also, in the start of every round players may take as many of the influence markers on their tablets as they like to their personal supply, but this must be done before seeing the new hand of influence cards. Finally in the end of the game players may take one coat of arms for every two markers on their Favorite tablets, so two coats of arms may be gathered this way.
The Favorite expansion have in my opinion a good effect on the play. It helps you when having bad luck with your influence cards. It also gives you a good way to get some extra influence markers. The game gets tighter and in some way it feels more balanced. I think I have no reason to play without the Favorite in the future, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m expecting Louis XIV to get now more frequently plays in our gaming group.
I hope you find this review useful. Have fun with Louis XIV!

4 Favorite Action Tablets, 1 Favorite Figure
1 Rule Sheet
Everything is in unplayed, New Condition (Open Item)
The expansion consists of one cardboard figure - the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Favorite - and four cardboard tablets, one for all players. And then there is of course a small sheet of new rules.
In game setup each player gets a personal Favorite tablet, which has four spaces - one space for each phase of a playing round. Players also take one extra influence marker from the general supply and put it on any space of the Favorite tablet, or to their personal supply.
The favorite figure appears on the board every round opposite of the Sun King in the inner round of the tile table. As the King, the Favorite also rewards a special prize for those who put their influence markers on the tile where he is present at the moment. The King rewarding crown chips, the Favorite gives you extra influence markers. The player with the most markers on the tile where the Favorite is gets two markers from the general supply to be put to their personal supply or favorite tablet, all other players present on the tile gets one. The regular prizes for the tile are also granted according to the normal rules.
With a marker on a space on the Favorite tablet a player may trigger once a corresponding phase a special action. In supply phase players may discard as many influence cards as they wants and replace them with new ones. In Influence phase players may disregard the moving rules and move their just placed influence marker to any tile they want. In scoring phase the Intrigue card gets more power - players may put three markers from their own supply or two markers from the general supply to the tile on which they play their Intrigue card. And finally, in the mission phase the players may keep up to three mission tokens to the next round instead of the normal one.
When triggering the special action from the Favorite tablet the influence marker on the corresponding space is returned to the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s personal supply. Also, in the start of every round players may take as many of the influence markers on their tablets as they like to their personal supply, but this must be done before seeing the new hand of influence cards. Finally in the end of the game players may take one coat of arms for every two markers on their Favorite tablets, so two coats of arms may be gathered this way.
The Favorite expansion have in my opinion a good effect on the play. It helps you when having bad luck with your influence cards. It also gives you a good way to get some extra influence markers. The game gets tighter and in some way it feels more balanced. I think I have no reason to play without the Favorite in the future, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m expecting Louis XIV to get now more frequently plays in our gaming group.
I hope you find this review useful. Have fun with Louis XIV!

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition, has been handled with TLC
My late husband was an avid board gamer and game collector.  Sadly the time has come for me to find new homes for all his games. (Except my favorites :) )  He took excellent care of all his games, no eating or drinking allowed while playing a game.  He had a huge collection, and most of his games had never even been played.  Feel free to message me with any questions or concerns.   Thank you!9</notes>
