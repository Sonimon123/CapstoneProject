Ascending Empires offers a nice mixture of building, exploring, and development, along with combat via a simple dexterity element. Players flick their starships into orbits around planets to defend or attack them or surround enemy ships to destroy them. 
Ascending Empires is sure to sate the desire for a space empire building game that plays simply yet deeply. </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7065)
Humanity has been at each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s throats since time immemorial. Now, in another galaxy, humans wage war amongst themselves again, but this time, with the aid of alien technology found on other planets. 
Ascending Empires offers a nice mixture of building, exploring, and development, along with combat via a simple dexterity element. Players flick their starships into orbits around planets to defend or attack them or surround enemy ships to destroy them. 
Ascending Empires is sure to sate the desire for a space empire building game that plays simply yet deeply.

    <notes>Complete and in excellent condition. Stickers neatly applied to discs, rules and cards are in excellent+ condition. Boards stored in original ziploc with original silica gel packet, but it does have some warping which will have an impact on play. All these boards warped a little bit with time and use, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better or worse than average.
Shipping weight is over 5lb, so shipping in the US will be USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate, $10.50.
Due to the weight international shipping is not available.</notes>

    <notes>Played twice. All components and box in pristine condition. This includes the untouched spare set of planet/asteroid/ship stickers. This comes from a smoke-free home and has been meticulously cared for.
The 4 corner pieces of the board have been tested for best fit and labeled accordingly on the back side with barely-visible black permanent marker according to quadrant. This particular board lays perfectly flat.
Includes 4 sets of glass beads to replace the original ships (which themselves are also included in case you prefer wooden pucks over the beads). The battleships have not been replaced.
I ship promptly and pack with loving care to ensure the game reaches you in the same condition it was when shipped. Shipping quote upon request. Combined shipping available, please browse my inventory! Local pickup available in Portland, Oregon. Serious inquiries only, please.
Photo album: http://imgur.com/a/WKWYj#0
The photos depict the box corners in worst condition -- one on top and one on bottom. The two corners depicted are the only ones showing any wear.
The photos of the marked board pieces show clearly that they are marked with greek letters in black marker on the backs. These are barely visible unless angled into the light.
The photos also show the original ships in a separate bag, having been replaced with glass beads of each color in the bags with the rest of the player pieces.
This item can be shipped in a large flat rate USPS box. For more secure packaging, a parcel in the neighborhood of 16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; with fluffy cushioning around the game within is recommended.</notes>

I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money. Shipping weight is 5 pounds.

    <notes>Played once by me, looks like it was played 0-1 time by previous owner. Game board lies flat. The board pieces fit together very tightly but I think that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just the way it was cut at the factory so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be surprised if they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t all like that. All other pieces present and in good condition. Stickers applied well and still includes the extra sheet.

Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>This copy is in excellent shape. The boards have been well cared for and have no visible signs of warping. All parts and pieces are included, with a few extra pieces thrown in for good measure (publisher mistake, maybe?). I originally purchased it used, so I do not know the full history of the game, but it was only played once by my group and was originally bought in Like New condition. Everything is included, even the letter stating that you should store the boards in the plastic bag to prevent warping.
Price is negotiable. Please send me a message if you are interested and we will see what we can work out. I will only pay for shipping if item sells at listed price; buyer is otherwise responsible for shipping charges.</notes>

    <notes>Game is 100% complete and overall in great condition.  The payer boards are warped (see picture), but this seems to be a fairly universal issue with this game.  The space tiles are pretty flat with no notable warping and fairly smooth transitions between the pieces.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not perfect everywhere, but again, this is one of the common complaints with this puzzle-board so I think this copy is about as good as you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re going to get (again, see picture of space tiles set up on my table).  Only other item of note is that one of the space tile has a small crease near one corner (see picture), but the board is actually still flat and smooth and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s over on the edge regardless, so it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play at all but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m being picky.  Box and remaining components are all in great shape and the extra stickers are still included.
US Shipping will be an additional $12 for USPS Priority Medium Flat Rate.  These boxes can be a close fit for this size, but I pack them well and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never had a complaint or any damage I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve heard about.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship in a larger box at actual cost if you prefer.</notes>

I ship economy unless you request otherwise. Please specify if want insurance so I can get you an accurate shipping quote. I will ship within 1-2 business days, and rest assured, I baby my games and I’ll pack your game carefully as if it’s my own.</notes>

    <notes>The game is in great condition. Played once several years ago. It now lives on my shelf. It needs a new home where it will be played more often. The box is in very good shape. The gameboard itself is slightly warped, an issue that many owners of this game discovered and complained about. It came this way while it was shrink wrapped in the box. It is SLIGHT, but the board does not lie completely flush with the surface underneath. The game is still playable and enjoyable. 
Please contact me with questions. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to answer your query. 
At this time, I accept payment by Paypal, personal check, or money order. My price INCLUDES shipping. I use UPS Ground or USPS Priority--usually whichever is cheaper for me.</notes>

    <notes>Great condition, played just a couple times. 
I felt the problem of board puzzle pieces being mismatched was fairly minor in my copy, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also includes 8 glass stones in each of the player colors, which can be used in place of the wooden starship pieces and slide much better over any rifts in the board. 
Shipping will be $11.30.</notes>

    <notes>With some regret, I part with my copy of Ascending Empires. The game has been opened and played once a few years back. Since then, it has been lying lazily on my shelve. Too much else to play and too little time. Now it is time for me to let go and give another player the chance to discover this great game and play it!
The game is complete. If you would like to see any additional pictures, just send me a geekmail and I will happily provide them.
And if you have any questions, please ask! 
Please note: Shipping ONLY to EU.
Shipping costs:
to Germany - 6 Euro - includes tracking and insurance
to EU - 16 Euro - includes tracking and insurance
Payment method A (preferred): via transfer to my EU bank account via IBAN/BIC in advance
Payment method B: via PayPal. Please note that if you choose this option, I will split the PayPal fee. In this case, 1,8 Euro/2 -_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 0,9 Euro. 
So the total price will be 75,9 Euro + shipping.</notes>

SHIPPING:
   USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: International shipping, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!  Only if you understand that, you could ask me for an exact shipping quote before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com to karlhanf@comcast.net; or by amazon.com gift card; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.</notes>

    <notes>This one is fun. We played it twice back when it first came out and never played it again. Ultimately the dexterity aspect lead to bad feelings for Pa. I think if you are going to get this game you should make the full board out of a single surface to avoid the board seams (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen instructions online but never took the time) and maybe your dad won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hate it.</notes>
