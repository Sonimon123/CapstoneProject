   <description>The Kingdom is in chaos. The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the new Fantasy Flight Edition. The game has been removed from the shrinkwrap and rules read, but never played. All cards still wrapped, all chits still unpunched. Still has that _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;New Game Smell_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;(tm). I really hate to part with it, FFG has done an excellent job at updating it. And the components are just beautiful. I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see it ever coming off the shelf due to time and space constraints.

    <notes>Game contents all new; counters unpunched, minis bagged, cards still in shrink, etc. 
The reason for the poor condition listing is that the box is damaged. The top right hand corner has obvious weight damage; it is indented along 50% of it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s length, and the lid_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s right corner is beginning to tear/split. 
Otherwise - perfect. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care about the game boxes (I do... I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m nuts), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be getting a great deal. </notes>

    <notes>Hi guys, new copy of Warrior Knights with the Crown and Glory Expansion! All components complete and in pristine condition as if the shrink just came off, the cards are even sleeved! I want someone else to enjoy it since its collecting dust in my house, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it for $35, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s less than half the price of buying both the base and the expansion together! hope you fun with this game!

    <notes>This is for the base game with expansion:
* Warrior Knights (base game)
* Warrior Knights: Crown and Glory Expansion
This game has been played once, and has been sorted neatly in bags.
The base game alone is about $40 on CSI / BnB, and the expansion is currently out of print.
Contact me with your zipcode to get an accurate shipping estimate. Unless you give a preference, I will ship whichever of USPS, UPS, or FedEx is cheapest with delivery confirmation. I will gladly combine shipping for multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>Description:
Each player takes on the role of one of six powerful Barons vying for control of the Kingdom. Through strategy, politics, and raw force, Barons gain influence over the land. In this struggle for power, will you lay siege to your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s city or try a more perilous assault? Does your strength lie in your military might or in your political power? Will you focus your limited resources on hiring mercenaries, supporting the Church, or gaining the upper hand at the Assembly?
 
The choice is yours in Warrior Knights.
 
Fantasy Flight Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s re-envisioning of the classic game of power and politics has arrived! Featuring new stream-lined gameplay, brilliant graphics, and gorgeous components, Warrior Knights is finally available for a new generation of contenders to the throne. For two to six players, playable in two to four hours.

·   24 plastic cities

    <notes>ATTENTION:  this order contains Both the base game AND the its “grail game” expansion Crown and Glory.  
The “Crown and Glory” expansion is extremely hard to find.  It was a smaller print run and is highly sought after, as it adds content and player options, while amazingly streamlining gameplay at the same time.  Mainly,it does it by adding more focus and direction for individual players at the start, and is especially helpful for people who aren’t naturally talkative or savvy right out of the games with an otherwise “blank canvas.”  That said, it does not constrain free-wheeling negotiations nor limit skull-duggery options in the least.  Once you’ve played Warrior Knights with the expansion, you’ll never play without it again.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Warrior Knights contains well painted miniatures and laminated player aids. The painted miniatures look GREAT on the board. All miniatures have been painted except for an extra city miniature. 
The box is a bit beat up, with a split bottom edge. The split does not go all the way through and the box still has strength integrity.</notes>

    <notes>I sell Warrior Knights from FFG with the Crown _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Glory Expansion, both english versions. 
The base game has been played only once or twice, the expansion has been played once.
All components are in the box of the basegame and are complete and like new (non smoker household, no pets). I checked the components before I put this offer on BGG.
Since this offer includes base game and expansion, I put this offer in both BGG entries: Basegame and expansion.
If you live in Germany you can pick up the game in Duisburg, otherwise the buyer pays the shipping costs, only bank transfer.</notes>
