   <description>Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia is a fast-paced, dice-driven dungeon crawl board game set in the Arcadia Quest universe where players control Heroes that explore three levels of a dungeon filled with monsters, traps and treasure! Bosses, special rooms and countless surprises await the Heroes, but only one can be the first to reach the final level and become the undisputed champion of the Realm!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Masmorra, players get to roll and re-roll a pool of Dice that guides their actions for their turn, and a unique dungeon is created as players lay down tiles while exploring it and fighting off monsters that are represented by special dice! But Heroes must also be aware of opponent Heroes, as they'll be able to use cards to disrupt their carefully laid-out plans!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for the Kickstarter Edition with all stretch goals, I believe I can still change the shipping address to you before it ships from CMON, so it will be like you got it straight from the kickstarter.  Item will ship from CMON when released in Q4.   I am selling at a reasonable price because I have been there on missed Kickstarters and hate when the price goes crazy on something.</notes>

    <notes>KS Dungeoneer Pledge. Includes all stretch goals and addons, including a bunch of extra heroes, plastic coins, and plastic treasure chests.
Also includes:
Luke the Lucky
Monster Dice Add-On Set
Adventurer Set
Arcadia Quest Crossover Kit
Not looking to make a huge profit here, just recoup my costs. After PayPal and BGG fees, this will be pretty much what I paid for it in the KS.
Base game played once. Shrink on Monster addon and Adventurer set removed, shrink removed from cards but boards unpunched and content unplayed.
All of the heroes include Arcadia Quest cards. GM me with any questions. Willing to trade, check my list. Will also consider offers. Thanks!
Buyer pays actual USPS shipping from 53121. Will ship in the actual CMON packaging.
