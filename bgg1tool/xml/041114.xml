   <description>The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rule Correction:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The Resistance is a social deduction game for 5-10 players that has several unique features not often found in the genre. While game play may share some similarities with Werewolf or Mafia, The Resistance offers innovations such as no player elimination, no need for a moderator, and a much faster play time. With the introduction of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Plot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the advanced game, The Resistance offers deep game play with significant opportunities for strategic play - and creates tense games that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be talking about days later.</notes>

 The Resistance is a social deduction game for 5-10 players that has several unique features not often found in the genre.

With the introduction of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Plot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the advanced game, The Resistance offers deep game play with significant opportunities for strategic play - and creates tense games that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be talking about days later.</notes>

The Resistance is a social deduction game for 5-10 players that has several unique features not often found in the genre. While game play may share some similarities with Werewolf or Mafia, The Resistance offers innovations such as no player elimination, no need for a moderator, and a much faster play time. With the introduction of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Plot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the advanced game, The Resistance offers deep game play with significant opportunities for strategic play - and creates tense games that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be talking about days later.</notes>

    <notes>Indie Boards and Cards (IBCRES2)
The Resistance is a very intense social deduction game for 5-10 players. While it shares similiarities with games like Werewolf, Mafia and even Battlestar Galactica it has many very unique features such as a quick 30 minute play time, no moderator required and no player elimination. Set in the near future, The Resistance pits a small group of resistance fighters against a powerful and corrupt government. The resistance has launched a series of bold and daring missions to bring the governement to its knees. Unfortunately spies have infiltrated the resistance ranks, ready to sabotage the carefully crafted plans. Even a single spy can take down a resistance mission team, choose your teams carefully or forever lose your chance for freedom. </notes>

Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately. 
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost. I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.

    <notes>Indie Boards and Cards (IBCRES2)
The Resistance is a very intense social deduction game for 5-10 players. While it shares similarities with games like Werewolf, Mafia and even Battlestar Galactica it has many very unique features such as a quick 30 minute play time, no moderator required and no player elimination. Set in the near future, The Resistance pits a small group of resistance fighters against a powerful and corrupt government. The resistance has launched a series of bold and daring missions to bring the government to its knees. Unfortunately spies have infiltrated the resistance ranks, ready to sabotage the carefully crafted plans. Even a single spy can take down a resistance mission team, choose your teams carefully or forever lose your chance for freedom. </notes>

    <notes>Indie Boards and Cards (IBCRES2)
The Resistance is a very intense social deduction game for 5-10 players. While it shares similarities with games like Werewolf, Mafia and even Battlestar Galactica it has many very unique features such as a quick 30 minute play time, no moderator required and no player elimination. Set in the near future, The Resistance pits a small group of resistance fighters against a powerful and corrupt government. The resistance has launched a series of bold and daring missions to bring the government to its knees. Unfortunately spies have infiltrated the resistance ranks, ready to sabotage the carefully crafted plans. Even a single spy can take down a resistance mission team, choose your teams carefully or forever lose your chance for freedom.</notes>

    <notes>(Only selling this one to Spain. The game can be bought anywhere and shipping would make it more expensive if adquired from abroad.)
Hicimos unas pocas partidas una tarde. Está básicamente nuevo y puestos a que se cubra de polvo prefiero que lo disfrute otro.
El pago sería por transferencia o ingreso bancario. Otra opción es el pago contra reembolso, pero esto encarece el envío y supongo que acaba siendo más caro que la comisión por transferencia bancaria.
El envío se realizaría como Carta. Son unos 5 euros que corren a cargo del comprador, pero con el paso del tiempo estos precios cambian y tendré que comprobarlo antes de cerrar el trato. El envío por Kiala (kiala.es) es otra opción más económica y cómoda que dependerá del comprador, aunque en este caso apenas existe diferencia debido al peso y volumen del juego.</notes>

    <notes>This is a Dutch version. Bought in the start of August 2016. Played only once. I sleeved the cards so the components are brand new. Rule book and plot cards are in Dutch. 
There is no tear or damage on the box. I removed the inside container because the sleeved cards didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit anymore. If you want to purchase the game, the cards will be UNSLEEVED and I can wrap them carefully so they won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t take any damage :)</notes>

    <notes>Very good condition
The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!
The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.
Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.</notes>
