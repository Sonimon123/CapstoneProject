   <description>For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; The Überplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Uuml;berplay edition)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rounding rule_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>In fact, it is unplayed. The coins are still in shrink. The cards are not in shrink anymore, but untouched. The reason I list it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; only is because of the box: slightly bend and some very little shelf wear on the corners.
This is the first, smaller Ravensburger edition. As a letter that one should ship for 6 Euro.</notes>

    <notes>For Sale by Uberplay
Each game last between 11 to 12 minutes. The game is fast paste and the competition is aggressive.
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have decent houses? Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry, if you are a skillful seller you will make more money selling your crappy houses.
Dan R. Wojciechowski (Chicago, IL USA)
For Sale is a short and deceptively simple game. The rules can be explained in 5 minutes, and the game can be played in about 10 minutes. (We tend to play several rounds and total our scores to determine a winner.) Still, while anyone can be taught to play, the simple mechanism of two rounds of bidding hide opportunities for some clever strategies. The small size make this game a natural for travel, camping, etc. I recommend For Sale as a tool for introducing new gamers to the wider world of non-traditional games.
Kavi (Georgia) 
This is an excellent board games. It takes about 10 mins to explain to a newbie. Strategy takes a bit longer to figure out. It is a bit like poker in the sense that you need to figure out what your opponents are going to pick.
U.S. Shipping is $3.97, local pickup is available as well so you save the shipping. I live in Queens zip 11364. I take Paypal, Money Order and Checks.
Let me know if you got any questions.
Thanks for visiting.

    <notes>Rated conservatively, would almost classify this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition but the game was played twice.  All pieces are present, no readily noticeable defects unless you look closely.  (It was played twice, so the cards were shuffled.)  Will ship USPS Priority mail.

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 101124N)
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Everyone I play with enjoys it - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the kind of game that you sit around wishing you had designed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower Bid and bluff your way to purchase the most valuable real estate for the lowest amount of money, then turn around and sell those houses (and shacks) for cold hard cash. Be the richest mogul at the end of the game to win this Stefan Dorra classic, which will be released in January of 2009. 
Considered one of the finest bidding games of all time, For Sale has a devoted following of fans that is about to grow much larger as FRED Distribution publishes the newest edition of this game as part of its Gryphon Games series. 
For 3-6 players ages 8 and up, this 20 minute game may seem short, but expect your gaming group to decide that there is time for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;just one more play!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 
Game Summary:
Going once! Going twice! Sold to the highest bidder! In this perfectly-crafted bidding game, players are forced to make a multitude of difficult decisions every minute - and that’s just in the first phase of the game!   During phase one, players must decide how much of their spending capital to invest in available properties, knowing that their own actions in the second phase could turn those properties into extremely lucrative bargains or crushing losses. 
Game Contents:
30 Property Cards 
30 Check Cards 
60 $1,000 Chips 
12 $2,000 Chips 
1 Rulebook  </notes>

A highly regarded Stefan Dorra classic, out of print for many years, is now back in a snappy –dare we say it, timely – new edition! One man’s castle is another man’s cardboard box… or maybe hisRV, tree house, igloo or skyscraper.In this fast-paced game of bidding and bluffing to get the highest-ranking properties, it isn’t how much you pay for the properties it’s how much you sell themfor.All players try to purchase the most valuable properties for the least amount of money and then turn around and sell those properties for the highest-valued Currency Cards. Whoever has earned the most money at the end of the game wins! </notes>

    <notes>Opened and played once. Gryphon Games edition. Box and contents in very good condition, however noticed that some building cards each have a printing blemish on the card back (off-white or black spot no bigger than a grain of salt), which shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play. One cheque card has a black spot (half size rice grain) on card back, again shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play if draw pile/hand cards obscured from card-counters!!!</notes>

One man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s castle is another man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cardboard box... or maybe his RV, tree house, igloo or skyscraper.

All players try to purchase the most valuable properties for the least amount of money and then turn around and sell those properties for the highest-valued Currency Cards.

    <notes>This is the pocket-size Chinese _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fake_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version, with only a deck of cards. I bought it when I was new to board games and not aware that it was fake. It includes all cards and a few thin paper coins. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s playable but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect high quality.
I will only sell this as an add-on item when you have an order of more than $25. Add more games to fill your order. Ships from 48105.</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101124N)
A highly regarded Stefan Dorra classic, out of print for many years, is now back in a snappy -dare we say it, timely - new edition! One man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s castle is another man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cardboard box... or maybe his RV, tree house, igloo or skyscraper. In this fast-paced game of bidding and bluffing to get the highest-ranking properties, it isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t how much you pay for the properties it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how much you sell them for. All players try to purchase the most valuable properties for the least amount of money and then turn around and sell those properties for the highest-valued Currency Cards. Whoever has earned the most money at the end of the game wins!</notes>

My husband was an avid gamer and board game collector. He passed away and now it is time for me to find new homes for all his games. He took excellent care of all the games, if they were played, no one was allowed to eat or drink while playing. The games have been stored in a smoke free environment. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!</notes>

Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 5.90
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 7.35
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 7.35
Registered Post: (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 9.10
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 12.40
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 12.40
Registered post everywhere else. 
Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
3) As a last resort, I also accept Skrill, Payza and Neteller (In that order and buyer pays fees).
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
