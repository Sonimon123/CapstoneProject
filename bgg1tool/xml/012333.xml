   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; John F.

Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;superpowers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components (original edition):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     228 full colour counters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full colour map _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     103 event cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     2 six-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     1 24-page rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     2 full colour player aid cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     260 full colour counters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mounted map with revised graphics_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     110 event cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     2 six-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     1 24-page rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     2 full colour player aid cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Jason Matthews_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP, CARD, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Mounted map with revised graphics_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Revised rules and player aid cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Mounted Map with revised graphics_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     New card decks_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Updated Rules _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Charts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Everything is in very nice shape, but this is a 1st edition, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve modified the cards to reflect the known errata at the time.  Some of that was done with stickers, some with sharpie pen and ruler, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s now effectively a 2nd edition.  The stickers will come off if you want to redo, but the pen lines won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, of course.  Anyway, not sure if this is a feature or not, but...I did the work for you, and I was reasonably (though not obsessively) neat about it.
Shipping is for a 3 pound parcel via Priority Mail (or the Flat Rate Box for $8.95, whichever is lower) from zip code 80015.  Please contact me with questions!</notes>

    <notes>I have a copy of Twilight Struggle that I purchased about 2 moths ago.  I punched it, and examined all of the cards in anticipation... and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played it.  Now with the acquisition of 1960, I have little desire to play it.  I would rather that someone else enjoy the game rather than have it gather dust on my shelf.
I think Priority Mail is about 11 dollars, but the box isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t very heavy.</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are – but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
– John F. Kennedy
In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s war machine, while humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;superpowers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.
Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources?
Twilight Struggles_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab- Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.</notes>

Will ship overseas with whatever shipper you request, but once I deliver it to the shipper, I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be responsible for it. Happy to combine shipping to save you money.
I will be out of the country from 29 June to 15 June, so if you see something you want, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wait.</notes>

    <notes>This game was purchased new from an online store and counters were punched. I have laid them in the counter sheet for this picture to show they are all there. 
This game was never played. I thought my wife and I might like a Euro wargame, but she was not interested after reading the rules.
Everything is mint---map is very large and made of thick paper.
PayPal only and shipping within continental United States only please.
Non smoking, non pet home, adult owned.

    <notes>This is the 1st Edition Game - not the Deluxe.The game is like new. The tokens have been punched, but everything is in excellent condition. The game includes a hard mounted special board that was posted on BGG. This board has been mounted very professionally on think illustration board (not cheap cardboard) and folds cut in a way that it appears to be a published board but there are 2 sections a top and bottom section. It lays fairly flat, but not perfect. The board folds and fits in the box along with the original thin board that came with the 1st edition - so you have both boards. A picture can be supplies if requested. Shipping will be actual based on how the buyer wants the game shipped. </notes>

That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history.  Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism.  We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States.  Overnight, the face of Europe had changed.  Suddenly, all things were possible.
That was 20 years ago.  Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place.  Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention.
This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of  that earlier era.  Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945.  Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known.  We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of  its most iconic statesmen:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy</notes>

    <notes>This is the first edition and has been played 3 or 4 times. I corrected the errors on the map and on some of the cards with a sharpie.
Normally I would list this game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but the fact that I used a sharpie on some of the components makes it a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for me. Game is complete.

    <notes>GMT Games - Twilight Struggle
Language: English 
Players: 2
Age: 13+
Duration: about 3 hour 
Weight: 1.700 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s war machine, while humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;superpowers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.

    <notes>This is a players copy.  The board was always used under glass, so pretty much perfect.  The cards show some wear.  Included are the expansions from C3i: optional cards, late war scenario, and Chinese map addition.  The cardboard insert from the box is missing (the contents did_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit well once the box had been opened).</notes>

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible.
 
That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention.
 
This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
 
This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen:
 
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy</notes>

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by Interparcel/Hermes (3-5 working days) as the item weighs over 2Kg  unless otherwise agreed with a charge of £5.99 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £4.99. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
There is the option of first class post and faster courier may be available if required.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.
Barry

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT051011)
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy </notes>

    <notes>I believe I have the GMT First Edition - Second Printing, but please ask questions if you have any (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not 100% sure how to tell, the reference sheet mentions second edition).  I punched it and played it one time, the game is in pristine condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT051011)
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy</notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT051011)
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy </notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are – but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; – John F. Kennedy
In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s war machine, while humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there now stood only two – the United States and the Soviet Union. The world had scant months to collectively sigh in relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the 45 year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the USSR and the USA. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new superpowers scramble over the wreckage of WWII and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.
Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that same tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower.
Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings: the Arab-Israeli conflicts, Vietnam, the peace movement, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war. Can you, as the U.S. President or Soviet Premier, lead your nation to victory? Play Twilight Struggle and find out.

As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy </notes>

Game is actually _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; including the game box... however there is a faint smell inside the box of something... if I had to guess it could be the smell of the ink from printing process?  Could be something else... I received this game in a math trade in 2010.</notes>

    <notes>This is my copy of Twilight Struggle that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve just never had the time to sit down and play.  This is sealed, new, in box.  I can ship immediately.  Shipping will be via USPS Priority Mail flat rate, or if you are in Chicago I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll wipe out the shipping cost if you want to come to the loop to pick this up.  Domestic US sales only, please.  Shipping is my cost on the shipping, no markup.
Edit to add: this is the deluxe edition as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been asked that a few times now.
Edit #2: Fixed a spelling mistake.  Since folks have asked me (since you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to see it as a buyer) I ship everything USPS priority mail flat rtae.  For this game it is $12.35, which is my cost.  I do this for a few reasons: 1) It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s easy and close to me so I can get stuff out normally next day; 2) The pricing is transparent to everyone; and 3) It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fast and trackable and inexpensive for the speed.</notes>

    <notes>This is the 2009 Deluxe Edition, with the mounted board, extra cards, and the rounded counters. It has seen some play but is in excellent condition throughout, almost _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (I take care of my stuff). There is a slightly (very slightly) crushed corner on the box that happened during shipment to me. </notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT051011)
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F.

Very good condition, played once.  Components in excellent condition.  One dent/gouge on back side of box approximately the size of a sunflower seed shell (closest item to reference I had readily available).
Estimated shipping is $12, exact amount to-be-provided based on zipcode.
Payment via PayPal only.  Shipping to continental US only.

    <notes>There is no insert as it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the box along with my plastic storage case solution.  Included are two 7 compartment storage cases with counters sorted.  The cards are unopened.
The box has some very noticeable damage/denting on one corner, but it is intact and sturdy.  Otherwise the game is like new.  This is the version with the nice mounted map.</notes>

    <notes>For the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;edition collector,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; this is the First Edition, original printing. It has _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Chili_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Replublic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the map. I purchased it directly from GMT via P500 back in 2005. Counters are unpunched, cards still in shrink. Box has some very minor shelf-scuffing, but it is otherwise just as received from GMT minus the outer shrinkwrap.
Add $12 for shipping via USPS Priority.</notes>

    <notes>Rules, cards and board are all in good condition.  There are a few marks on the board, but nothing that affects play in anyway.
This is actually used to belong to the League of Extraordinary Gamers Club in Brisbane, and there is a sticker on the board confirming as such. 
Payment by bank transfer.
Pick up in Brisbane.  Otherwise, contact me for a shipping quote (should be about $17 in Aus).</notes>

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT051015)
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy</notes>

However, since I KS_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d it 18 months ago, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve not played the deluxe edition even once! So... Need to move games I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play.

    <notes>This is for my Collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition of Twilight Struggle with all of the promos.  Game is brand new and has not been played.  All card packs are sealed and the few counters are unpunched just as they came.  The only thing I have done is sticker the blocks, but all of the spare stickers are included.  Also the sleeves provided were severely warped and in an unusable state so they will not be provided.
Local pickup in the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti area is available with cash as a payment option for pickup.  Otherwise paypal will be used.

    <notes>GMT GAMES (GMT051015)
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE is my all-time favorite game. It is a brilliant first design by the team of Jason Matthews and Ananda Gupta. It takes the card-driven genre of games like WE THE PEOPLE, HANNIBAL; ROME VS. CARTHAGE, and WILDERNESS WAR to its highest peak. Every game is different and the game gets better and better as you become more familiar with the individual cards. You are surprised as hidden combos are revealed game after game. Every turn is filled with tension as you try to figure out the best way to play the hand of cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been dealt. Gaming simply doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any better than this. -Alan R. Moon. On November 9th of 2009, the world will mark the 20th Anniversary of the conclusion of the Cold War. That was the day that the Cold War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most tangible symbol -- the Berlin Wall -- was relegated to the ash heap of history. Unlike the 20th Century_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other great conflict, the Cold War did not end in an explosion of neutrons, but rather, an explosion of human freedom and optimism. We had avoided what many thought inevitable -- the destruction of mankind through armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Overnight, the face of Europe had changed. Suddenly, all things were possible. That was 20 years ago. Sadly, we all learned that the end of the Cold War was not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the end of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Mankind would find new ways to divide itself. While the threat of nuclear holocaust disappeared, newer and more sinister forms of conflict would take its place. Where once superpowers bestrode the globe, decentralized networks and even individuals now command the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s attention. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle seeks to capture the feeling of that earlier era. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. Using the card-driven game mechanics pioneered in such award winning games as We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Twilight Struggle recreates the conflict between the most powerful nation states the world has ever known. The scope of the game covers the entire world as it was found in 1945. Players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Event cards add cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Berlin Airlift, to the Vietnam War and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis. This Deluxe Edition of Twilight Struggle marries world-class components, with the sort of world-class game play for which GMT is already known. We cannot think of a better way to commemorate this vital piece of world history. We invite you to relieve an era with the words uttered by one of its most iconic statesmen: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - John F. Kennedy</notes>
