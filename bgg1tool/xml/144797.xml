    <notes>Kickstarter version of Argent. It has never been played. It is unlikely I can get anyone to play.
I also have Mancers and Summer break. Make an offer for them when you inquire about Argent and I will include them at a fair price.
Shipping will likely be 15 dollars depending on the weight and distance. I use USPS. If you want it sent by other means let me know. Shipping worldwide will likely cost more. You will have to be patient for me to get a quote.</notes>

--------------------------------
Will only accept Bank Transfer or Paypal
Will Ship Worldwide with shipping costs payed by the buyer. 
Shipping from Europe so buyers from outside of the EU should know there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a high possibility of Custom Taxes.
I have many games in the Marketplace so check them out to see if you have interest in more than one, you can probably make some savings on shipping.
Since this will be an heavy package (don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know for sure the weight until I box it up) the Shipping Costs to European Countries should be:
2001 grams to 3000 grams = 29.10€
3001 grams to 4000 grams = 30.25€
4001 grams to 5001 grams = 33€
5001 grams to 6000 grams = 36.90€
6001 grams to 7000 grams = 38€
7001 grams to 8000 grams = 40.50€
8001 grams to 9000 grams = 43€
9001 grams to 10000 grams = 45.5€
There can be bigger weight categories if needed
If you are from outside of the EU please contact with your location so I can get a Shipping Quote from the Postal Service</notes>

    <notes>INCLUDES: Mancers of the University big box expansion AND the Summer Break mini-expansion! Also includes a special, hard-to-get minigame designed by me.
New in shrink. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the designer, and I have an extra copy. I can peel a corner back and sign it if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.
Note: There is a current Kickstarter for a 2nd edition with improved components. Since this is 1st edition, you may want to purchase the upgrade pack from that Kickstarter. But by getting this, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll spare yourself a 6 month wait!
Due to weight and size, shipping will be about $25.</notes>
