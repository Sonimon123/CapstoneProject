   <description>From the depths of space an ancient vessel drifts slowly towards the Imperium of Mankind - a space hulk. Within its confines, untold thousands of Genestealers slowly emerge from hibernation. The Space Marines must enter the cramped corridors and tomb-like chambers of the ancient ship to defeat this alien menace._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Space Hulk is a board game for two players, recreating the battles fought between the Space Marines and Genestealers. One player commands the Space Marines as they carry out deadly missions in the ancient Space Hulk, and the other commands the horde of Genestealers opposing them. Space Hulk's fast-paced rules simulate the tense atmosphere of a mission deep inside the cramped confines of a derelict space hulk, where split-second decisions are needed for victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>New, still sealed. 
Shipping within the U.S. will be $15.
International shipping will vary. Please contact me for shipping quote. It is a heavy box, weighing nearly 5 kilograms, so shipping may be substantial. However, if you want less shipping, I am willing to open the box and punch the tiles. This will remove around 1 kg of material and will reduce shipping costs. I will not remove any of the plastic pieces from their sprues. 
If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks.</notes>

I use USPS Priority Mail shipping so can be a bit much for this heavy game.

The guy I originally got this from traded it to me, but 3 of the minis are broken -- one of the Genestealers needs his arm glued back on, and two of the space marines need their arms re-attached as well.
Needless to say, I was upset about this, too.</notes>

    <notes>This item is for WestonTheFox only.
Conditions:
You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to open the box, and examine the contents (though you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to punch anything or clip anything off spurs).  This is to ease my mind that this will become a playing copy.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m actually doing this for another reason as well. There have been threads here on BGG with incidents of misprintings of the game (some tokens with blank sides). I want to be certain this is not one of those copies (as I have no idea myself).  If this is a bad copy, you will not be obligated to make the purchase.  Otherwise, the sale is final.
With that condition in mind, the sale will have to take place locally in a public location (on which we have agreed).</notes>

    <notes>NO MINIATURES ARE INCLUDED!  The tiles are completely unpunched, except for a couple and their backs are little messed up.  CONTACT ME FOR PICTURES!  This is through no fault of my own - the miniatures inside made little _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bumps_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the front of the game box (the top cover is a little bumpy, my other copy is like this too) because it was so jam packed full, and also managed to do a little damage to the backside of the first layer of tiles.  They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re little dings in the back.  Again, except for a few tiles, everything is unpunched.

    <notes>Game in excellent condition. Looks like it was just removed from shrinkwrap.
Models have been taken from sprue and most have been assembled and prepared for painting (mold lines removed). I have been categorized as an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;expert painter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by several people, so you can rest assured that the job done is a good one!
Everything will be perfectly prepared for shipping. The models will be shipped in two slotted boxes that hold one model per slot to avoid damage during transport.
Bank transfer preferred above PayPal, PayPal costs are for the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>2009 Edition.  New in Shrink.  Will ship worldwide.  Priced to sell.  
To all buyers, please note that this game weighs 10 lbs. and is an awkward size.  Cost of shipping to U.S. addresses will be roughly $35.00.  The U.S. Postal Service charges a premium for awkward sizes.  For shipping via UPS, they have a professional packaging service, so the price is the same, but the item will be professionally packed, with insurance and delivery confirmation.</notes>

    <notes>I bought this used on ebay. All pieces present and accounted for. One of the Terminators is partially painted, all figs have been cut from their sprues, but none have been glued. The rule book and mission book are in good shape, but not perfect. The box has no dents or major scrapes, a couple of corners are a little worn, but overall definitely presentable. Please see the pics, message me if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>This auction is for an unplayed, yet opened and punched copy of Space Hulk 3rd ed.
In like new condition overall. The components are punched and in unplayed/like new condition. Components are baggied or small plastic storage containers for ease of useability during play.
Be sure to email me if you have ANY questions.
I make sure to ship games so that they arrive at your door in the same condition that they left my house in. The interior of game boxes will be packed to make sure contents do not shift during transit.
I will ship only to residences within the United States. Parcel tracking is mandatory for your and my protection. Insurance is strongly recommended. Buyer pays all shipping costs.
I only charge exact shipping amounts. I generally quote a bit higher on shipping estimates to make sure all costs are covered but any amount that goes over actual shipping costs I will refund. Games are expensive enough as it is without shipping costs biting into them.
GM me with any questions you might have or to request a shipping estimate to your zipcode. </notes>

    <notes>Near mint.  Shrink removed, contents verified complete, nothing removed from sprue.  The Space Marine Librarian with Force Axe figure has some very small stress lines on the hoses leading to the force axe.  I do not believe they will be visible or a problem one the figure is painted.  Rulebooks placed in ziploc bags.  To be safe I have requested a replacement part from GW UK (GW US didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have it).  If they provide the part I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include it (seems obvious I know :)).  Shipping Insurance for $175 value highly recommended with purchase.
From the depths of space an ancient vessel drifts slowly towards the Imperium of Mankind - a space hulk. Within its confines, untold thousands of Genestealers slowly emerge from hibernation. The Space Marines must enter the cramped corridors and tomb-like chambers of the ancient ship to defeat this alien menace.
Space Hulk is a board game for two players, recreating the battles fought between the Space Marines and Genestealers. One player commands the Space Marines as they carry out deadly missions in the ancient Space Hulk, and the other commands the horde of Genestealers opposing them. Space Hulk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fast-paced rules simulate the tense atmosphere of a mission deep inside the cramped confines of a derelict space hulk, where split-second decisions are needed for victory.</notes>

    <notes>The pieces have been assembled carefully but not every little nub of excess plastic has been filed down precisely or anything like that.  They are unpainted.  There was one space marine whose little chain got clipped off in the detachment/assembly process -  you would have to really care about the model aspect of the game to even notice that. This copy includes the 3rd party produced foam rectangle that holds all of the plastic pieces in place during storage.  All components are present and in very good shape. Us shipping will be $15 for this large box game.</notes>

    <notes>My copy of Space Hulk was opened two years ago, the figures were assembled, but the game was never played. The box has barely noticeable shelf wear.The boards are unpunched (a bunch of the boards are still in orginal sealed plastic). A couple of the figures have some damage because I was clumsy taking them off the plastic spokes. One figure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s head keeps coming off but that can be easily glued on. I filed all the bases of the figures so they stand up perfectly. I am including a free copy of Space Hulk:Death Angel-The Card Game with this purchase.  </notes>

    <notes>The game is complete and everything is in great condition having only played it a couple of times. 
All miniatures are fully complete (nothing snapped off when removed from the sprues) and will be v securely wrapped and packaged for postage.
Although I am happy to ship worldwide please be aware this is a large and heavy game so will likely be quite expensive!</notes>

    <notes>Punched and the miniatures were cut carefully from the sprues and then assembled, but they are unpainted.  All components are in pristine condition.  Only played 3 times.  Box has dividers glued in-place to help separate the components.  There is a small puncture in the box top that is very hard to see since the cardboard has been re-set in place.  It is about the diameter of a pencil.  I did not notice this until I saw it from the inside of the box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 85oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order, but expect it to be as much as $15 total). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>New, shrink was torn and so removed. Lid was removed exactly once; at that time it was noticed that the manual was slightly dog-eared from the manufacturer (from sliding around in the box), so it was moved under the top couple punchboards to keep it flat.  Everything is otherwise completely untouched and as-new.

    <notes>Space Hulk... NEW, still in its shrink wrap!!!
I will ship only to the lower 48 United States
Shipping will be approximately $28 with insurance and tracking (because of the value of the game I will not ship any other way)
If you live in another country feel free to inquire.
Shipping will be very expensive.
I consider international shipping based on BGG profile and activity
I am open to reasonable counter offers
I am in the South Bay area of Los Angeles and frequent Irvine (close to John Wayne airport) if you want to do a F2F transfer.</notes>

    <notes>Game is brand new, still in the shrink wrap.  I wound up buying two copies and my wife says I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keep one as a collectible.  Pictures to follow.
Note: Seller assumes no responsibility for the condition of the box contents.  It was shipped to me carefully, It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been sitting safely on a shelf since I received it.  But anyone who owns Space Hulk can tell you that GW packed the boxes to the last centimeter with big heavy parts.  
So just be aware; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not an attempt to put a fast one over on anybody.  My opened copy had a space marine power hose snapped and a genestealer arm coming loose, both of which needed a little minor repair.  Just the way they packed the boxes for whatever reason.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Complete. Punched, pieces assembled. Never played. Box lid has a couple small gouges on the inside where the plastic sprues hit during shipping. I will probably ship in two boxes, one with the game and unpunched components and one with the figures that have been assembled.  I have some paints , citadel burnished gold . leviathan purple wash and asurmen blue wash that I can include.  I was going to paint this but other projects have taken precedence.  Enjoy will leave on BGG for a week starting today May 30th 2013 then its going to ebay, need the cash.  Thanks very much for looking.

Will post to Europe or Worldwide if you like, but I imagine the shipping will be high as it is a heavy item. 
Shipping charged at cost, send me your address when purchasing and I will calculate it. For the UK it is likely to be around £8.

    <notes>Only played twice before been sitting in the box for a couple of years.  The game is being sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as is._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; All parts appear to be present,  minis clipped and some need to be reglued, the crest of sergent lorenzo is loose and there is a crease in the corner of the rule book.  The bottom of the box has some minor shelf wear.
Buyer pays shipping.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good size heavy box so estimates from USPS  shows the shipping to be around $22.00, but that would vary up or down depending on your location.  I will give final total once address is supplied.</notes>

    <notes>Ok so I have played this game once. It is in great condition. 
See Photos Here:
https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2432642/saca-muela
https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2432643/saca-muela
Good News:
1)The game comes with Battlefoam 
Photo here: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2432643/saca-muela
2) The price is cheap
The bad news:
1) There is a fourth edition - I have heard some say they like the third edition rules better though. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not familiar with the nuances. 
2)  The only cosmetic problem with it is the eagle on one dude_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s head is broken. I have glued it on a few times but it comes off easily (dumb design) also I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure about the robot tractor claw thing. I think I cut it right from the sprue but for some reason in the back of my mind I think I may have cut off part of it that looked like it was part sprue but it was not. 
Here is a photo: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2432644/saca-muela
As far as I can remember and see, this is the only cosmetic concern with the game
None of these things affect game play.

    <notes>Excellent condition. The minis aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t painted, a previous owner glued most of them together.  Previous owner had one part of a marine snap, but they since super glued it well. A couple of the genestealers are in two pieces but snap together just fine (I leave them apart in case they snap whilst in storage).
Most the tiles have this common warping problem you can check for on the forums. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t interrupt gameplay at all. You can see in the pictures a comparison of the same tiles from different angles.</notes>

    <notes>Opened from shrink, unpunched everything, and assembled the minis. This was my first assembly, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure how they turned out in regards to the norm, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m bringing down the price on this one!
Unfortunately from the travels and poor packaging (everything was pressing against the top of the box even in shrink), two of the aliens are missing limbs. These limbs and minis are separated out and should be easily glued back on and repaired. Everything else is in perfect, pristine condition. Please inquire if you are interested in pictures.</notes>
