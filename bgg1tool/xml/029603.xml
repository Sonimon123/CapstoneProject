   <description>Solitaire study of America's most bloody and heroic day in WWII. The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Widerstandsnest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. One map, two counter sheets, 55 cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Additional Notes:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     =====_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;352 counters.

The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Widerstandsnest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. One map, two counter sheets, 55 cards.
352 counters. Basic unit size is the US infantry company. German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies. US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included. US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game.
The map depicts the entire Omaha invasion area 9km long, going inland 4km, at 250 meters per hex. Hexes are oversized (almost 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units.
Time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours.
A deck of 55 cards performs triple duty -- determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn.

    <notes>Decision Games (DCG 1018)
Solitaire study of America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most bloody and heroic day in WWII. The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Widerstandsnest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. One map, two counter sheets, 55 cards.
352 counters. Basic unit size is the US infantry company. German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies. US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included. US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game.
The map depicts the entire Omaha invasion area 9km long, going inland 4km, at 250 meters per hex. Hexes are oversized (almost 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units.
Time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours.
A deck of 55 cards performs triple duty -- determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn.</notes>

    <notes>Decision Games (DCG 1018)
Solitaire study of America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most bloody and heroic day in WWII. The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Widerstandsnest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. One map, two counter sheets, 55 cards.
352 counters. Basic unit size is the US infantry company. German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies. US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included. US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game.
The map depicts the entire Omaha invasion area 9km long, going inland 4km, at 250 meters per hex. Hexes are oversized (almost 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units.
Time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours.
A deck of 55 cards performs triple duty -- determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played this game a few times.  I enjoyed it but just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play solitaire that much anymore.
Counters are in trays.  Cards are sleeved.  Everything is in great condition.
I charge only actual shipping cost.  I can likely ship this using USPS Regional Rate A from zip code 52240 so cost should be pretty low depending on where you live.</notes>

    <notes>Decision Games 2nd Edition 2013. BGG Very Good condition. Complete, cards sleeved, pieces in two GMT game trays. two counters are less than perfect from the crappy die cut and the effect on trying to carefully separate the counters. This does not affect play, but this is being done as part of full disclosure.

    <notes>The game is brandnew and still shrink-wrapped!
100% mint! The box was never opend.
All items are really on stock. No fake set-up here. No Order on demand.
International Customers, our precise shipping costs are as follows:
DHL International Shipping: Zone 1 (Mostly Europe): 16,00€+1,00€ per kilo
Shipping costs can vary greatly after that and have to be asked for individually.
We ship only fully insured. So ordering only a small pocket game or anything very low priced may come out to be very uneconomical.
Methods of payment:
-You can always pick the game up at our storage location :-)
-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use paypal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)
Für unsere deutschsprachigen Kunden:
Sie können uns für alle Fragen gerne telefonisch kontaktieren:
Tel.: 0201-786877
Die Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschlands betragen 5,- Euro (inkl. 19% Mwst.). Ab 100€ versenden wir innerhalb Deutschlands Versandkostenfrei.
Alle Preise enthalten die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer in Höhe von 19%.
Bezahlmöglichkeiten für Kunden innerhalb Deutschlands:
- Alle Kreditkarten willkommen !
- Paypal
- Vorkasse
- Rechnung (Nicht für Erstbesteller, wir behalten uns vor die Zahlungsmöglichkeit per Rechnung von Fall zu Fall neu zu bewerten !)
 
Alternativ ist natürlich auch eine Abholung mit Bar-, EC-, oder Kreditkartenzahlung in unserem Lager möglich. (Im Geschäft wird neben Brettspielen auch eine üppige Auswahl an Rollenspielen angeboten.)
Beachten Sie bitte auch unsere Aktionen und weiter Angebote auf: www. fanen.com
Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie können Ihre Vertragserklärung innerhalb von zwei Wochen ohne Angabe von Gründen in Textform (z. B. Brief oder E-Mail),
oder durch Rücksendung der Sache widerrufen. 
Die Frist beginnt frühestens mit Erhalt dieser Belehrung.
Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist genügt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs oder der Sache. 
Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:
Fantasy En_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Counter c/o Holger Willert
Gudulastr. 5 D(Hofgebäude rechts hinten) 
45131 Essen
email: fanen@fanen.com
Widerrufsfolgen
Im Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren. 
Können Sie uns die empfangene Leistung ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurückgewähren,
müssen Sie uns insoweit ggf. Wertersatz leisten. 
Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung - wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre - zurückzuführen ist. 
Im Übrigen können Sie die Wertersatzpflicht vermeiden, 
indem Sie die Sache nicht wie ein Eigentümer in Gebrauch nehmen und alles unterlassen, was deren Wert beeinträchtigt. 
Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, w
enn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt,
oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung,
oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. 
Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. 
Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. 
Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung erfüllen.

    <notes>I purchased the game new, this comes with the version 2.0 rules. I did punch and clip the counters with a 2mm rounder. The cards are sleeved and includes a GMT counter tray. This also includes a flip book, which is a file on BGG, that I had printed and spiral bound, intended to help walk through the phases of game play (included and pictured). I had all of best intentions to play this game, never got it to the table. The game has been stored in my smoke-free home and there is no physical damage or odors to the game. This is listed in the USA and would prefer to ship to US, via USPS medium flat rate box for $13.45, buyer to pay shipping.</notes>
