   <description>Along the lines of History of the World by The Avalon Hill Game Co, players cycle through a series of European civilizations as they attempt to score the most points using the civilization's special powers.  The game is set in Europe. Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.  Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.  The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.  Play continues with the cycling of civilizations until a certain score is reached, whereupon final rounds are played and a victor is determined._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Small World (released in March 2009)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hi!  The condition is Very Good as per the strict BoardGameGeek rating system.
This game is in excellent condition.  All components and the box are present and like new, except for the rules booklet which is almost like new with a few tiny wrinkles; it is intact and completely functional.  This game has been played 5 times or less.
Descartes (english) edition.
NOTE: I will be out of town until the 2nd of January.  At that time I will see if anyone wants any of my games for sale-- preference will be given to people that want more than one (and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good way for you to save on shipping).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship this any way you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.  You will need to pay the exact shipping charges.
Bruce :-)

    <notes>Vinci, 2nd edition (English language version)
Played twice.  The first time was a walk through, and the second time was real.  I enjoyed it, another one in our group enjoyed it, two were very lukewarm, and my wife _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care if we don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play it again._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  So, it hits the trade/sale pile.
Condition:
The game is complete and in excellent condition -- board, chits, rules, cards, summary, wooden tokens.  
There is one blemish: a few small marks on the back of the board (as received from the manufacturer) where the black backing-paper had been nicked off.  The total area involved is roughly 1-inch by 1-inch.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll gladly provide pictures if you are interested.
Based on someone else_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s question about shipping cost, I weighed the game.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about 3.5 lbs, shipped.  So, unless you are really close to zip code 48104, the cheapest way is the USPS Priority flat-rate box for $8.10.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re close to 48104 (Ann Arbor, MI), USPS by weight may be cheaper -- please feel free to ask.
Paypal gladly accepted.</notes>

    <notes>Nice shape, played only a few times. I did mark a few of the yellow and red discs with a little black sharpie dot in the center of one side because I used the discs to play Dune. :)  Pretty minor, really, but this copy is less for collectors than players.
Should be a 3 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

Sure, Small World is out, but its boards are ugly AND not very functional. Vinci_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s board is not very attractive, but it makes it easy to play the game!</notes>

Punched and verified complete. One box corner very neatly repaired.
Thank you for looking.
I only ask for the actual shipping charges to you. The amount of postage will be printed on the package so you can see exactly what it cost me. Let me know if you want insurance, for while I will use a box and pack using newspaper and such, games have to ship at your risk. I am happy to combine shipping and will be delighted to use flat rate boxes when available.
Paypal (no Credit Cards - sorry) or US postal service money order only please.
Thank you again.</notes>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>BRANDNEW: I´m offering this fantastic game in mint condition (still in shrink-wrap!). 
*** Improved 2nd edition! ***
This is the German edition, but the civilization markers are self-explanatory (illustrated), so there is no language dependency.
All games come from a private collection (non-smoking environment)!
Please contact me if you´re looking for more interesting German games as I can offer a lot more.
Buyer pays actual postage, so ask before buying to determine the weight of your desired games! 
The following payments are welcome: 
(1) Cash in a registered letter (only Euro accepted) or
(2) Chargefree EU Bank-Transfer (using IBAN and SWIFT) or 
(3) Moneybookers.com (it´s as fast and safe as PayPal but much cheaper: maximum fee is 0.50 EUR) or
(4) PayPal (for PayPal payment please add +5 % of the total sum).
Have fun playing, Flix!

    <notes>This is the 1999 1st EDITION. Gently played only a few times, so everything is still in excellent condition. All pieces sorted and bagged. Box has light edge wear at the corners.
Shipping in the U.S.A. will be USPS Priority Mail 2-Day Delivery (comes with free tracking # and $50 insurance coverage). Mailing cost for most games will be $10.00 or less for USA delivery. Heavier games will be more expensive, but you can choose Standard Mail (delivery time 5-7 days) to get a lower shipping cost. Send me a message to ask for a firm price. Shipping discount available for multiple items on the same order (send me a message for a price). 
**For international orders please ask for a shipping price quote.**</notes>

2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
