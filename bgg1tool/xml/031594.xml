   <description>Stefan Feld's 3rd game by Alea is In the Year of the Dragon._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000. The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;person_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Careful planning is the key to surviving _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;the year of the dragon,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; but survival alone may not win you the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game and box are in nice shape, everything well cared for. Played only a few times.
The actual weight might vary slightly after packing; I just give an honest guess, in this case 3 pounds. I ship via USPS from zip 80015. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing or handling, and will use the lower of Flat Rate ($9.30 now, but it creeps up now and then) or Priority Mail, or Parcel Post if you prefer.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 348)
Type: Economic 
Number of players: 2-5
Age of players: 12+
Length: 75-100 minutes
Game Description: In this game, each player takes on the role of a Chinese prince, seeking tomaximize the prosperity and prestige of his province in the ancient Chinaof approximately 1,000 A.D. To assist in these endeavors, the princesmust call upon the diverse talents of their courtiers, from scholars andmonks to warriors and craftsmen. These loyal subjects will lend theirexpertise to the struggle to shield their rulers from the often disastrousconsequences of the myriad untoward events that plague the populacefrom month to month. Be it drought, contagion or Mongol invasion,only foresight and planning will spare the princes and their subjects fromthese fates.The better a player can manage his province and withstand the seeminglyunending onslaught of hazardous events, the more honor and victorypoints he will have to show for it in the end.

Game Description: In this game, each player takes on the role of a Chinese prince, seeking tomaximize the prosperity and prestige of his province in the ancient Chinaof approximately 1,000 A.D. To assist in these endeavors, the princesmust call upon the diverse talents of their courtiers, from scholars andmonks to warriors and craftsmen. These loyal subjects will lend theirexpertise to the struggle to shield their rulers from the often disastrousconsequences of the myriad untoward events that plague the populacefrom month to month. Be it drought, contagion or Mongol invasion,only foresight and planning will spare the princes and their subjects fromthese fates.The better a player can manage his province and withstand the seeminglyunending onslaught of hazardous events, the more honor and victorypoints he will have to show for it in the end. </notes>

    <notes>The game is new in shrinkwrap but was damaged in shipping. This is the German edition, English rules will be provided.
The game is new and unplayed, still in shrink. The box, however, has issues: A crease runs down almost the entire left side of the bottom of the box. The area near the bottom left corner is pushed in about an eighth of an inch causing an at least partial split at the edge. None of the damage is visible if the box is stored upright like a book.
Shipping via USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail unless otherwise requested. Happy to combine shipping of multiple items.</notes>

Payment via PayPal, or cash for local pickup.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of GMT war games and other classic boardgames. </notes>

I usually get the package in the post the day after purchase. I must emphasise that I take extra care to package in a sturdy box with packing protection, however I accept no responsibility for the package once it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the hands of Auspost. If you have a wild postal contractor who likes to hurl boxes AFL style at your front door then please let me know to organise signature on delivery. (Likewise if you live in a building where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not prepared to take the risk of Auspost leaving a parcel at the front door.) No refunds for damage or loss in transit - please take it up with Auspost. All parcels come with a tracking number. If you require extra insurance then let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll arrange it.

    <notes>Punched but never played. 
This is the German language edition, but the game is fully language independent and it comes with a full colour print-out of the English rules and original German rule book. 
Game in perfect condition, with just a very, very small amount of wear on the corners of the box from it being stored on the shelf - but you have to really look for the wear to notice it. 
Postage to UK - £4.

    <notes>Please read the full listing for this incredible value rare game with expansions!  First the very minor bad news..the game is missing one blue circle disk.  This is only used as a points tracker around the score track (its one of those standard blue circular disks...nothing fancy).  You can easily use something else and you only need this if you are playing all five players (or is someone is obsessed with playing as blue).  Second, there is a small crease on the top left of the box as seen if you look closely in the picture.  Light corner wear but nothing horrible.
Now the GREAT NEWS....The game comes fully sleeved with premium sleeves, includes a Plano box for storage, AND even includes the EXPANSION 1 and 2 from the Alea Treasure Chest (these are very very hard to get now and sell for at least $20 each)!
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t miss your chance to get this rare game WITH the mini expansions now!
Shipping and handling is $12.00 flat rate medium box priority mail with bubble wrap protection to the USA only!  Enjoy the rare game!
**Insert discarded for Plano Storage box.</notes>

    <notes>German edition but the game is totally language independent. None of the components have German writing on it other than the rule book.
The English version of the rule book can be easily downloaded on the internet
Contents are complete and in very good condition.
The only reason why it is classified as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is because of the indentation on the top cover of the box.
Shipping costs will vary from destination to destination so please contact me if you would like to know the exact cost.
UK bank transfers are accepted or Paypal (buyer pays fees).</notes>
