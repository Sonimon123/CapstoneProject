   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The way to have Power is to take it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; - William _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Tweed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city's growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor's grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization's influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the era of Boss Tweed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The way to have Power, is to take it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - William _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Tweed. Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the cities growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals and win election. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;As long as I count the votes, what are YOU going to do about it?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - William _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Tweed. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - William _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Tweed. Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s influence spanned from its founding in the 1790_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s to its collapse in the 1960_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870; the era of Boss Tweed. In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayors grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try and take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy. Tammany Hall. Take Power. Rule New York. </notes>

Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the cities growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals and win election. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;As long as I count the votes, what are YOU going to do about it?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - William _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Tweed. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - William _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Tweed. Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s influence spanned from its founding in the 1790_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s to its collapse in the 1960_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870; the era of Boss Tweed. In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayors grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try and take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy. Tammany Hall. Take Power. Rule New York.</notes>

    <notes>Kick starter Edition. Game opened but never played.
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. If you want the game to be shipped outside of the USA, please geekmail me first. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in very good condition and has been verified as complete including the original rulebook. Box has light storage wear but in very good condition. Cardboard box insert is also present.
Note: Only copyright I see is 2009 (on the back of the box and the rulebook) but Pandasaurus, whose logo is on the box in several spots, didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t publish a version until 2012 which would be the third edition.</notes>

    <notes>There are some issues due to bad production quality:
* Some (about 3) wooden boss meeples are damaged
* One green (Irish) favor disc is missing (however, one unused Irish sticker is still there)
* One part of the main board has been separated: I fixed it with Scotch Tape from the back side which cannot be seen from the front side
All other components are in an (new) excellent condition. I tested the game only for 30 minutes.</notes>
