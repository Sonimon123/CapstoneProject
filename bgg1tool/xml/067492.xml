   <description>Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s endless supply of gold._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battles of Westeros is played over one of several included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ve activated from those you haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t), the sight of your army_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG BW01)
Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.
In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock’s endless supply of gold.</notes>

    <notes>Comes with a bonus map!  Well, to be fair, the extra map has a small tear away from the backing, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not even visible (you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only notice on folding/unfolding it).
Otherwise, basically like new, no issues, played a couple times. Should be a 8 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Played only once. All armies painted. Paint job is definitely not professional grade, but much better than the plain gray and red unpainted figures that the game comes with.
This is a heavy game so shipping will be $14.00</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGBW01)
Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle. In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s endless supply of gold. </notes>

    <notes>Missing the insert in order to fit everything in the box. All other components are like new. One of the big concerns many had with the game were the figures not being manufactured with bases attached. These figures were super glued into the bases. A few have fell out and need to be reglued, but it isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t very challenging. US only. Feel free to email any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Battles of Westeros collection - includes the base game, and the expansions, Wardens of the North, Wardens of the West and the Baratheon large expansions (also, an unopened banner set).   Game components are in the Base and Baratheon boxes (no inserts but pieces stored in plastic cases). Also, no expansion boxes are included.   Important point  (I feel this is a positive) - all the playing pieces have been super glued into their bases (many, many hours to accomplish this - so you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to do it; and it is necessary).  This is the reason the listing is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;VG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;LN_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  From smoke free home.  Buyer to pay shipping (expect that to be FedEx Ground (given the size of the two boxes) and pay pal fee.</notes>

All components are like new, except the pieces from the base set have been glued to their bases. This took me over 3 hours to do and I never even played the game. There is no box insert for the base game in order to accommodate the expansions, which do not come with their own boxes.

    <notes>ALL EXPANSIONS INCLUDED!!! I played through most of the base game but never played most of the expansions. Condition of game is quite good (just a little wear in the community used pieces). Does not include any of the original boxes as I store everything in a plastic tote. Half of the main character minis have been painted (I think they turned out quite well :P). All cards have protective sleeves with horse sigil on back. All minis have been glued. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
