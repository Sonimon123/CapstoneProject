   <description>Nemesis is a 1-5 player survival sci-fi game where players are woken up from hibernation as a crew of a space ship. The emergency procedure states that there is a critical system failure and the space ship can't continue its cruise. The goal of the crew is to find what is causing this failure and fix the situation to safely return back to Earth. The main problem is that one crew member is dead. Somebody crashed his hibernation chamber and pulled his body out. In addition, if you listen closely, some additional noises and sounds can be heard. New ones, strange ones, ones that were never heard before_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Nemesis is a cooperation game combined with bluffing, backstabbing, and other elements of a science-fiction survival horror adventure._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>*** PREORDER WITH EXPECTED DELIVERY Q4 2018***
Base pledge (includes Voidseeders expansion and aftermath expansion + all stretch goals) + Terrain expansion + Medic.  No sundrop.
I paid for 2-wave shipping.  This means you will get the base game as soon as it is available, rather than having to wait until all the stretch goal content is ready.  
If you purchase before it ships to me, I will change the address to you, which means shipping is FREE!  
If you purchase after I am able to change the address (probably a month before it ships), then shipping will be expensive.  I will charge exact shipping for the base game, plus an estimate for the stretch goal content (Likely $40-$50 total).</notes>

There is also some promotional material from Tainted Grail.
I will include the 2nd waive of kickstarter with the stretch goals when it arrives here in Barcelona - it seems will be this quarter. 
The box is open and the components as well. Never played the game. The inner box is slightly open on the top, but is not visible once you close the box.
Game is essentially as new.
I can ship now the core game and extras which allow you to start playing the game and do a 2nd shipment  of the rest when it arrives.</notes>

    <notes>1ST WAVE IN HAND. Brand New REGULAR CORE pledge for Nemesis by Awaken Realms. Will include core game and stretch goals. See below for full list. 
What i have IN HAND is the base game so you can play NOW and some of the little teaser gifts from Awaken Realms. 
PRESALE. Presale means that i do not have all the contents shipped to me yet. Apparently there has been some confusion here so i apologize if i am being overly clear :). 
I can ship in a single wave when everything is delivered. This will be the cheaper option. Due to wanting to have the game faster for my buyers, I paid extra to receive a first wave ahead of time. 2 wave shipping always costs more than 1 wave so PLEASE NOTE that the 2 wave option will be more than $35. I have ran costs through Fedex, UPS, and USPS and it seems that the 2 wave option will cost $20-$30 more. There is a ton of content still coming in wave 2 so i wont know exactly what we are looking at until it comes.
Kickstarter delays are likely. Will ship first come first serve. 
Included is as follows:
Core box game of Nemesis boardgame:
25 miniatures, 120 cardboard elements, 280 cards, 50 other elements 
+ all unlocked stretch goals:
- Mechanic miniature + his hero tray, action cards and starting items
- 5th player contamination cards
- Co-op mode:
- rulebook, hourglass, 5 new primary objectives, 10 character achievements cards
- playing as intruder option: rules after character death, intruder player board, 5 intruder objective cards
- custom slime markers
- custom ammunition tokens
- alternative ship layout on the back of the gameboard
- 5 special card holders (to hide your equipment)
- additional noise and combat dices
- Voidseer expansion: 15 miniatures, 60 cards, 20 tokens, other components
- Untold stories - gameplay script comic book
- 3 turret miniatures and 10 tokens (plus tile)
- malfunction and fire tokens upgrade
- Spacecat figure
- Aftermath expansion: Rulebook, 6 models, 120 cards (final amount may vary a bit), 7 tokens, 18 other elements
As far as payment goes I would strongly prefer Zelle, Chase Pay, or even personal check. If you have any questions on this please let me know!</notes>

    <notes>I have the first full wave of the Kickstarter version of Nemesis.
Played once, everything is just as it arrived. Only wear is on the playing card box included with the KSE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s where it ripped slightly when I first opened it. You can actually see my unboxing via my channel :D
Buyer pays actual shipping cost instead of an estimate I might make up, will determine once purchase is made based on location (U.S. shipping only).
If you are interested in also receiving my Wave 2 stuff let me know, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s $320 for the all in version. I can change the shipping address for that one, so no added shipping cost! Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.</notes>

    <notes>Used Kickstarter Wave 1 - - I bought used and then used it more myself! Great Game!! (Now this game feels like the movie _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Aliens_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;!)
I am now selling this in anticipation of mine arriving!
A few of the cards are worn, just a bit on the edges, should not effect the game at all.
Trying to provide more info for all of those folks asking...Core Box + Wave 1 Stretch Goals (see below)
The following are all of the Wave 1 Stretch Goals that I received (that I am aware of....reference my pics):
*6th Character - Mechanic; Action Cards + Hero Tray + Starting Items
*Co-op Rules is just a blurb in the rulebook and NO HOURGLASS (nothing separate like the Kickstarter shows)
*5th Player Contamination Cards
*Rules after character death + Intruder Player Board and Cards
*Alternative Ship Layout on back of the board
*5 Special Card Holders (Kickstarter shows different colors, however, they are all grey but numbered 1-5)
*1 Additional Combat Die 
*1 Additional Noise Die
*Alternative Intruder Pose 1, 2, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 3
*(I believe the Action Card and Intruder Attack Card Individual Illustrations; i.e. - I remember all the cards having different art)
*Untold Stories #1 + Sheet of Tokens to go with it! My understanding is that this would add Cooperative Campaign.
*NO CUSTOM SLIME MARKERS - just clear glass beads (I think this part of the Kickstarter stretch goals changed)
*Plastic Fire Tokens Upgrade
*Plastic Malfunction Tokens Upgrade
Please reference pictures to understand all you are getting. Thanks!
Happy to answer any questions you may have!
