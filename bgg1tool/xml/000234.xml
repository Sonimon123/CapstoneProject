   <description>This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion. See the Hannibal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Hamilcar entry for details of the 2017 revamped game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

It has a minor tear on the bottom cover of the box, and the 8 consul election marker are a bit darker in color, due to contact with water, but else the game is complete and in perfect condition!

By default the buyer pays for standard shipping using New Zealand Post International Air Parcel Post, which takes between 4-10 days to deliver to the other side of the world. This includes insurance for items up to approximately US$175 in value. Just ask if you would prefer other delivery options.
I always package my games very carefully to avoid damage in transit. Zealand Post International Air Parcel Post to anywhere in North America/East Asia will be approximately US$30, and to anywhere in UK/Europe will be approximately US$34.

    <notes>Has some pen marking on the board charts were errata was corrected by hand.
Yes it is complete. I recounted all the components
today.
Please note that the rulebook claims that there are
132 political and 100 combat units. This has never
been the case as the game never came with 100 combat
units. I compared the actual pieces to these scans
here:
http://www.thewargamer.com/Scans/HannibalCombat_AH.jpg
http://www.thewargamer.com/Scans/HannibalMarkers_AH.jpg
My game does include all 48 Battle Cards and 64
Strategy Cards. It includes the following counters:
101 PC
13 cities
8 consul
1 proconsul
1 turn marker
8 tribes
= 132 political markers
and
14 leaders
28 Romans
19 Carthage
5 siege
1 siege train
2 elephants
combat units, which you will see is the proper mix
from the scanned sheet.

By default the buyer pays for standard shipping using New Zealand Post International Air Parcel Post, which takes between 4-10 days to deliver to the other side of the world. This includes insurance for items up to approximately US$175 in value. Just ask if you would prefer other delivery options.
I always package my games very carefully to avoid damage in transit. New Zealand Post International Air Parcel Post to anywhere in North America/East Asia will be approximately US$30, and to anywhere in UK/Europe will be approximately US$34.

    <notes>1996 Avalon Hill (English) edition.  Components are complete and in mint, unused condition: counters are unpunched, cards are shrink-wrapped.  Box has minimal shelf wear and a piece of clear tape on two sides -- Avalon Hill sold them this way (taped shut instead of shrink-wrapped) towards the end of the print run (when they were having financial troubles).
Shipping charge will include $3.20 for insurance.  This one is too valuable to let it get lost in the mail.</notes>

    <notes>Hannibal has been opened, but it is mint, and has never been played. The box has a split corner, and I have taken the rulebook and combined it with the internet rulebook so that you get one complete set of rules with the battle card listing in it (important for battles).  Shipping is calculated based on where you live. I can send it via Priority Mail if you live in the US.  For this one, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to insist on tracking and insurance.  Feel free to ask questions!</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill version of the game.  The pieces are punched, counted, and sorted in plastic bags.  The pieces, board, rules, and cards are all in very good shape.  One corner of the box is split and repaired with tape.  In addition to the game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included the issue of the General (Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s magazine) that featured Hannibal and contained several strategy articles.  The game has been kept in a non-smoking home.  The buyer will pay shipping depending on where they are located.  I will combine shipping on multiple items so check out my other games for sale.  Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY 401)
One of the greatest military commanders and tacticians in history descends on the Roman Empire once again. Do you face him as Rome and try to ward the invasion that comes from the North, or do you climb atop your war elephant and show Rome you will take that which they hold most dear: their territory.
Designed with all new artwork from Kurt Miller this is a reprint of the very popular Avalon-Hill version from 1996. The game uses the popular card system, which first appeared in Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s We the People, to recount the Second Punic War from 218 to 203 B.C. Players use strategic-level cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and generating historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.
This is a 2-player game with a playing time of approximately 150 minutes.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the latest Valley Games edition of Hannibal: Rome v Carthage. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only weeks old and is in mint condition. The only thing that has happened to this game is; it was unwrapped, counters punched, rules read then it was bagged, sealed and put away. You can see from the photo I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve provided how crisp everything is, just look at the cards.</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY 401)
One of the greatest military commanders and tacticians in history descends on the Roman Empire once again. Do you face him as Rome and try to ward the invasion that comes from the North, or do you climb atop your war elephant and show Rome you will take that which they hold most dear: their territory.
Designed with all new artwork from Kurt Miller this is a reprint of the very popular Avalon-Hill version from 1996. The game uses the popular card system, which first appeared in Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s We the People, to recount the Second Punic War from 218 to 203 B.C. Players use strategic-level cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and generating historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.
This is a 2-player game with a playing time of approximately 150 minutes.

    <notes>This listing is for two sets of the Valley Games promotional miniatures for their edition of Hannibal.
These sets are being sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  The reason I have two sets is that the first set was unsatisfactory quality (stickers cut off center, etc).  Both sets are essentially still in the shipping box.</notes>

I have gone through the game and made sure that every single component is present and in good order. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only play it a couple of times - really enjoyed it but I need to clear out some space. This is the excellent Valley Games edition. Any questions then PM me.</notes>

INCLUDES the Valley Games preorder-only generals in their plastic container.
Will ship anywhere, but international bidders beware that shipping with tracking is at least $40 and probably more. Buyer pays full shipping cost. All of my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games are for sale as well, so if some of those interest you, let me know and we will negotiate a price.</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY401)
One of the greatest military commanders and tacticians in history descends on the Roman Empire once again. Do you face him as Rome and try to ward the invasion that comes from the North, or do you climb atop your war elephant and show Rome you will take that which they hold most dear: their territory. Designed with all new artwork from Kurt Miller this is a reprint of the very popular Avalon-Hill version from 1996. The game uses the popular card system, which first appeared in Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s We the People, to recount the Second Punic War from 218 to 203 B.C. Players use strategic-level cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and generating historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political. </notes>

    <notes>This is for a set of the Valley Games pre-order [b]plastic Generals ONLY[/b].
These were never played with, but some of the stickers have been applied. Other stickers are missing; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably better if you use something else anyway (the Valley stickers are difficult to work with)! A few of the pieces arrived broken, but a little superglue should take care of that. Also, this copy shipped with 2 figurine errors (2 extra guys with shields and their left hands up, instead of the guys with their right hands up).
Shipping USPS Priority: $10

    <notes>Description: 
Hannibal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s daring assault on the Roman Republic is re-fought by you in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. Designed with all new artwork from Kurt Miller, this is a reprint of the very popular Avalon Hill version of 1996. Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage uses a popular card system, which first appeared in Avalon Hill’s We the People, to recount the Second Punic War from 218 to 203 B.C. Hannibal has been called the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;father of strategy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  and players will use strategic-level cards for multiple purposes in this game: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces engaged in the war and generating historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political. This is a 2-player game with a playing time of approximately 150 minutes.

Happy to provide exact shipping costs--it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a medium-sized box, and will ship for at most $12 anywhere in the continental U.S. Local pickup available in the D.C. area (20815).

It is in excellent shape, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is appropriate term for how everything looks. Box is in very good shape, shows no real shelf wear at all, no creases or dents. Included is a copy of the 2nd edition rules ( printed by me from online files) . Also a copy of  a score sheet, as well as errata and clarifications printed by me in 2005. Great game, but I just need to thin the collection!

    <notes>Game has been played a couple of times. 
The game is missing one stand for the Roman Generals. This does not affect game play as you will never have all of them on at the same time. It came missing this stand, so I am not sure if this is intentional or if they failed to include it in the game box.
I will send this as cheaply as possible using USPS.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been played, but stored in excellent condition
Game has been handled with  TLC.  My late husband was an avid boardgamer, and like to play almost as much as he liked to collect them.  He took excellent care of all of his games.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play them all, but if he did play them, no food or drink was allowed near the game.  All games have been stored in a pet free, non smoking environment.  Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask if there are any questions.  Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Very Good / Like new. Valley Games edition. It is open, has been played. Except for being punched, the contents are absolutely like new. Everything is clean and glossy, sorted and bagged. The cards are sleeved. The standees have always been stored separate from their stands, keeping them uncreased and scratch-free. Except for a few wisps of corner wear, the box is perfect!
