   <description>Zendo is a game of inductive logic in which one player, the Master, creates a rule that the rest of the players, as Students, try to figure out by building and studying configurations of the game pieces. The first student to correctly guess the rule wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Inspired by Eleusis, Zendo uses Looney Pyramids but was released as a standalone game in July 2003.  In 2017, a version of Zendo was released that had only one size of pyramid but added blocks and wedges. It also includes an optional system of cards for generating the Master's rule, useful for novice players who are not yet comfortable making their own rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I got this new in shrink, but someone had neatly used a black sharpie over the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Buddha_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; word on the Zendo cards?  Odd, but doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay.  you can buy replacement cards if you really need them.</notes>

    <notes>Zendo pyramid bundle
Includes:
-  Zendo
-  IceDice
-  Pink Hijinks
This Zendo set has been enhanced to support more players/options.
Originally it came w/ 5 sets of 4 colors (60 total pieces). 
This set includes 6 sets of 6 colors (108 total pieces).
The cards are sleeved and everything fits neatly into the box, including the materials for the other bundled games. I made a custom insert to organize everything.
The box is showing its age but is still in overall very good condition. Everything else is pristine.
Check my gallery for pictures.</notes>

    <notes>This is a strange little game using transparent plastic pyramids in various sizes.  The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;grand master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; constructs a series of  configurations and the other players try to deduce what the common rule is that the groups marked with the black stone share that the groupings marked with the white stone do not. Sounds simple? Not really. Test your skills of observation and deduction.</notes>
