   <description>The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;Hegemony War (30.027_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships with which to wage war. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. Lead your people to victory!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find Eclipse for a decent price?  Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your chance. Full disclosure, I got this game and attempted to laminate the mats.  The lamination did not meet my expectations, but all of the player mats and tech mats are in good shape and perfectly usable.  Everything is unpunched. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just neurotic about eyesore on my games.  I have since bought a replacement copy.  This gem can be yours for the low price of $50, plus S+H.  Example pictures of the lamination blemishes are included (my finger is pointing them out). The blemishes occur on the majority of the mats.  </notes>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition inside and out.  I would prefer to sell it with the Supernova expansion, which is still in shrink, for an extra $15.  Total = $110.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to sell it with the expansion, but based on the prices that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m seeing it (Supernova) listed for on BGG, this seems like a fairly good deal.
Please be aware that this is a large/heavy game.  Shipping to Canada will likely run close to $20 (less in BC), and closer to $30 to the US.  I will get an official quote for anyone who buys the game, but he/she should be prepated to pay a shipping cost that is in the ballpark of the above estimates.

    <notes>Game is new in shrinkwrap and have not been opened.
This is the lautapelit.fi, English Edition, very hard to find.
However, there is a rip/tear at the box bottom and a little bit of the shrinkwrap have been peeled. This is the same condition when I got from the store (I took good care of my games).
Please see pictures for more detail (especially the second and third pictures). Feel free to ask for more pictures.
Buyer pays shipping, I round up the actual shipping charge to the nearest dollar to cover gas and time for packing etc. Shipping should be around $15 to $22 within the States.
Since this is a heavy package. Please feel free to contact me for a exact shipping quote.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.</notes>

    <notes>Game was punched, bagged, and played once. It is in excellent condition. I really enjoy it, but my group isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t quite as enthused so its not likely to hit the table often. If someone wants to play it now I figured I could use the money to get a couple of games that will be played more often.

    <notes>All the components are in very good condition. I have played it 3 times. I received it as a present but have come to the sad realization that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the right friend group to sustain its long play time.
Included is a 22 compartment organizer to house all of the ship parts, dice, and other components! See attached picture.
English rule book.
The game came missing one ambassador tiles but it also came with extra blank pieces including a tile shaped like the ambassador, which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve used to replace the missing piece. To my knowledge everything else is there.
I will ship as soon as payment is confirmed (I live in Seattle), and will send the game UPS or USPS depending on how quickly you want it and how much shipping you wish to pay. 
Enjoy!</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink. My opportunities to play have not occurred as I had hoped and so I figure it is time to set it free. 
There is the small remnant of a price tag on the shrink, but the next person that gets it should open it and play! :)
Truth be told, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not looking to make a profit here, just recoup most of my costs. 
(If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re local to the Columbus, OH area and can arrange local pickup, let me know and we can arrange a price modification.)</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Counsil was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the scalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Counsil itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, ressearching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
 The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Counsil was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the scalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Counsil itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, ressearching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Counsil was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the scalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Counsil itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, researching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
 
The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Counsil was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the scalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Counsil itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, researching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, researching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with. </notes>

    <notes>Brand new in shrink. 2nd Edition with the red alien on the front as pictured. 
Game will be packed with care. Feel free to check my 100% positive marketplace and trade feedback.
Buyer pays actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred. International buyers must also cover insurance (usually only $2-3 extra) to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Happy to combine shipping if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying more than one item, and also open to offers for some of the games listed on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; list.
Will accept PayPal, money orders, OLGS gift cards, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s or personal checks but buyer will need to cover any associated fees other than the 3% going to BGG.
Feel free to peruse my trade and marketplace feedback to get a feel for how much I invest in making sure every person I deal with is absolutely thrilled with what they get.
If you have any questions, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask!
Kind Regards,
Dante</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, researching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMECLI01)
The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, researching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with.</notes>

This listing combines several items:
1) Eclipse base game-- I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the English First edition, since it says 2011 on the back of the box. Everything unpunched. Never played. Looks great. 
--Comes with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Eclipse Resource Trays with Bottoms_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (six of them), made by The Broken Token.
--Comes with the Supernova expansions, first and second editions.
2) Nebula and Pulsar expansions for Eclipse
3) Eclipse Ship Pack one-- Opened, but never played. Ships are still in sealed bag and everything is unpunched. Excellent condition.
4) Suburbia--   Out of shrink, but not played. Everything unpunched. Excellent condition. 
5) Mondo -- English edition. New in shrink.
6) Rune Age game plus Oath and Anvil expansion--  Out of shrink, but never played. I started to sleeve the cards but didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do all of them. Cardboard chits are unpunched.

The shadows of the great civilizations are about to eclipse the galaxy. The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran-Hegemony War (30.027-33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable. Only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule? Lead your people to victory! A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast civilization, competing for success with its rivals. On each game round you expand your civilization by exploring and colonizing new areas, researching technologies and building spaceships to wage war with.</notes>

    <notes>Having a clear-out. Feel free to check my other listings for combined shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened this and punched out all the tokens, but never actually played it.
Unfortunately, one of the tiles has a very slight tear on the front from punching it out, see picture below. This doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect the game in any way, since the tiles are chosen blind and the back is still perfect, but could annoy some people (I suspect you could just colour it with black marker and nobody would ever notice tbf).
Torn tile: https://goo.gl/photos/qiV6v9HZVhPX7KNF8
Shipping £7 to UK. European shipping at cost, so please feel free to ask (although I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve looked into shipping to the mainland before and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s usually pretty uncompetitive - sorry!)</notes>

    <notes>Base game + Rise of the Ancients expansion + Ship Pack One expansion + 9 acrylic overlays for player mats to keep resource cubes in place.
Everything fits in the big box base game originally came in, though I do have boxes for both of the expansions still, so if you want those as well, I can ship them too, but this would increase shipping cost.
Game played a couple of times only, box(es) and all components are in *excellent* condition, no wear and tear, no missing components.
Shipping cost is not included and will depend on your location.
Let me know if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to use Friends and Family option for PayPal payment, in which case an extra $2 will added to the price.</notes>

This is a brand new game. It has not been opened and is still wrapped in cellophane. However, during original shipping there has been some damage done to the box. It is surface damage only to the underside and does not infringe upon the structural integrity of the box. Please see the high resolution images for the damage details.
Postage anywhere in the UK for £5.99. 
The box weight is 3Kg.

Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.

Widerrufsrecht für Verbraucher
(Verbraucher ist jede natürliche Person, die ein Rechtsgeschäft zu Zwecken abschließt, die überwiegend weder ihrer gewerblichen noch ihrer selbstständigen beruflichen Tätigkeit zugerechnet werden kann.)
Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie haben das Recht, binnen vierzehn Tagen ohne Angabe von Gründen diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen.
Die Widerrufsfrist beträgt vierzehn Tage ab dem Tag, 
- an dem Sie oder ein von Ihnen benannter Dritter, der nicht der Beförderer ist, die Waren in Besitz genommen haben bzw. hat, sofern Sie eine oder mehrere Waren im Rahmen einer einheitlichen Bestellung bestellt haben und diese einheitlich geliefert wird bzw. werden;
- an dem Sie oder ein von Ihnen benannter Dritter, der nicht der Beförderer ist, die letzte Ware in Besitz genommen haben bzw. hat, sofern Sie mehrere Waren im Rahmen einer einheitlichen Bestellung bestellt haben und diese getrennt geliefert werden;
- an dem Sie oder ein von Ihnen benannter Dritter, der nicht der Beförderer ist, die letzte Teilsendung oder das letzte Stück in Besitz genommen haben bzw. hat, sofern Sie eine Ware bestellt haben, die in mehreren Teilsendungen oder Stücken geliefert wird;
- an dem Sie oder ein von Ihnen benannter Dritter, der nicht der Beförderer ist, die erste Ware in Besitz genommen haben bzw. hat, sofern im Rahmen einer Bestellung Waren zur regelmäßigen Lieferung über einen festgelegten Zeitraum hinweg geliefert werden.
Um Ihr Widerrufsrecht auszuüben, müssen Sie uns (MSK Anja Schlimbach e.K., Kopenhagener Straße 2, 51149 Köln, Telefonnummer: 02203/36688, E-Mail-Adresse: info@msk-web.de) mittels einer eindeutigen Erklärung (z.B. ein mit der Post versandter Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail) über Ihren Entschluss, diesen Vertrag zu widerrufen, informieren. Sie können dafür das beigefügte Muster-Widerrufsformular verwenden, das jedoch nicht vorgeschrieben ist.
Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist reicht es aus, dass Sie die Mitteilung über die Ausübung des Widerrufsrechts vor Ablauf der Widerrufsfrist absenden.
Folgen des Widerrufs
Wenn Sie diesen Vertrag widerrufen, haben wir Ihnen alle Zahlungen, die wir von Ihnen erhalten haben, einschließlich der Lieferkosten (mit Ausnahme der zusätzlichen Kosten, die sich daraus ergeben, dass Sie eine andere Art der Lieferung als die von uns angebotene, günstigste Standardlieferung gewählt haben), unverzüglich und spätestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag zurückzuzahlen, an dem die Mitteilung über Ihren Widerruf dieses Vertrags bei uns eingegangen ist. Für diese Rückzahlung verwenden wir dasselbe Zahlungsmittel, das Sie bei der ursprünglichen Transaktion eingesetzt haben, es sei denn, mit Ihnen wurde ausdrücklich etwas anderes vereinbart; in keinem Fall werden Ihnen wegen dieser Rückzahlung Entgelte berechnet.
Wir können die Rückzahlung verweigern, bis wir die Waren wieder zurückerhalten haben oder bis Sie den Nachweis erbracht haben, dass Sie die Waren zurückgesandt haben, je nachdem, welches der frühere Zeitpunkt ist.
Sie haben die Waren unverzüglich und in jedem Fall spätestens binnen vierzehn Tagen ab dem Tag, an dem Sie uns über den Widerruf dieses Vertrags unterrichten, an uns zurückzusenden oder zu übergeben. Die Frist ist gewahrt, wenn Sie die Waren vor Ablauf der Frist von vierzehn Tagen absenden.
Sie tragen die unmittelbaren Kosten der Rücksendung der Waren.
Sie müssen für einen etwaigen Wertverlust der Waren nur aufkommen, wenn dieser Wertverlust auf einen zur Prüfung der Beschaffenheit, Eigenschaften und Funktionsweise der Waren nicht notwendigen Umgang mit ihnen zurückzuführen ist.
Ausschluss- bzw. Erlöschensgründe

- zur Lieferung von Zeitungen, Zeitschriften oder Illustrierten mit Ausnahme von Abonnement-Verträgen.

- zur Lieferung von Waren, wenn diese nach der Lieferung aufgrund ihrer Beschaffenheit untrennbar mit anderen Gütern vermischt wurden;
- zur Lieferung von Ton- oder Videoaufnahmen oder Computersoftware in einer versiegelten Packung, wenn die Versiegelung nach der Lieferung entfernt wurde.
