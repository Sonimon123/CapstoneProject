Identify!
You are a Shadow, a creature of the night, or a Hunter, a human whose job is to destroy supernatural creatures, or a civilian, a normal human just caught in the middle of this ancient battle. But your identity remains secret until someone outs you through your actions and through Hermit cards or you reveal yourself to use your special ability. The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early.
Survival!
Once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack without impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious – or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory.
Good game for a large group of players.
Contents: 1 board, 16 wood cylinders, 74 cards (10 character, 6 area, 16 Hermit, 16 black, and 16 white cards), 8 player cards, 2 dice (1x6 sided and 1x4 sided), rules

Identify!
You are a Shadow, a creature of the night, or a Hunter, a human whose job is to destroy supernatural creatures, or a civilian, a normal human just caught in the middle of this ancient battle. But your identity remains secret until someone outs you through your actions and through Hermit cards or you reveal yourself to use your special ability. The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early.
Survival!
Once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack without impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious – or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory.

Identify: In Shadow Hunters, each player has a secret character identity - Shadow, Hunter or Neutral (civilian). Figure out the identities of the other players to determine who is  your ally and who is your ennemy!  Survive: Once your identity is revealed, your ennemies will attack you using their special  abilities such as Demolish, Teleport, Suck Blood with the help of equipments like Rusted  Broad Axe or Cursed Sword Masamune. A fierce survival battle between the Shadows and the Hunters will ignite where only the strongest can win. Unless, a civilian in the right 
circumstances, claims victory!
THIS EDITION INCLUDES more Hunters, more Shadows, and more Civilians are included to add variety to your Shadow Hunters games. Some characters include: Bryan with his MYGOD!!! special ability; Fu-Ka and her Dynamite Nurse ability, and Ultra Soul with his Murder Ray ability. With this many more characters, you will leave players guessing as to who you really are!

    <notes>This listing is for the Shadow Hunters Board Game by Z-Man Games!
The game have been opened, but the components are still sealed (cards, tokens). The game has never been played and it is essentially new.
I am an avid gamer and take excellent care of my games.
The game comes from a non-smoker home.
Please contact me if you have any questions and please see my other listings. I will always combine shipping to save you money.
Happy Gaming!</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Punched, played twice with sleeved cards. Components are in excellent, like new condition. Box has very light shelf wear, appearing near new.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.95 (small), $13.10 (medium), or $17.90 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Prefer PayPal or Venmo
Buyers pay actual shipping costs. I can give an estimate if you list your zip with your bid and send me a geekmail. All games will be shipped via USPS. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to potentially using other options if preferred. I will only charge for shipping charges and will refund any difference if I initially use an estimate. International buyers are welcome, but be aware that international shipping these days is not cheap! I will only use USPS to ship international. 
If you are relatively close by and wish to pick up the game from me in person in Los Angeles, CA, that can also be arranged. I also do a lot of driving for work, mainly on the Westside and would be more than happy to drop the game off if you live in that neck of the woods...or meet you halfway if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t.</notes>
