   <description>Power Grid deluxe: Europe/North America is a standalone game in the Power Grid universe._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For the 10th anniversary of the highly successful game Power Grid we present this new deluxe version including brand new components. Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage. New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play. An exciting new two players experience is also added - _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Against the Trust_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network reaches a predetermined size. Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities. However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;What's more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;renewable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Power Grid deluxe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is based on the highly successful game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Power Grid_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. However, it is not simply the same game with bigger, better and more beautiful components, but rather a version made especially for the 10th anniversary. Everything is bigger: the double-sided game board now offers all of North America and all of Europe, rather than just the USA and Germany. The customized wooden parts offer actual generators for the players and different shapes for the resources, among them natural gas instead of garbage. All the power plants have been changed and we added new resource refill cards to make refilling the resource table easier. The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-racking resource speculations, complex city networks and the tight competition among the players - all the way to the nail-biting end, as several players vie for the win. This is a box filled with good and proven parts in updated, new shapes. We wish you a lot of fun!</notes>

However, it is not simply the same game with bigger, better and more beautiful components, but rather a version made especially for the 10th anniversary. Everything is bigger: the double-sided game board now offers all of North America and all of Europe, rather than just the USA and Germany. The customized wooden parts offer actual generators for the players and different shapes for the resources, among them natural gas instead of garbage. All the power plants have been changed and we added new resource refill cards to make refilling the resource table easier. The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-racking resource speculations, complex city networks and the tight competition among the players - all the way to the nail-biting end, as several players vie for the win. This is a box filled with good and proven parts in updated, new shapes. We wish you a lot of fun!</notes>
