   <description>For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands. Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Thunderstone: Starter Set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I played the game once, did not like it so I am giving it away. It is in like new conditions... no flaws.
I have put all the cards in sleeves (exactly matcing the card size) so I have saved you from this trouble!!! And they are brand new!
I can ship or give hand to hand either from London (UK) or Athens (Greece) since I move between these two destinations frequently.
Any questions... let me know.

    <notes>OK, read carefully. 
This is a Thunderstone SUPER SET. You get the core game and the following expansions:
Dragonspire
Doomgate Legion
Thornwood Siege
Wrath of The Elements
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For the Dwarves_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Promo card set
That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s almost everything for the game apart from Heart of Doom and the new Advance set. This is HUNDREDS of cards.
But here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the catch- no expansion boxes, everything is packed and neatly sorted in the core set box, and some of the duplicate base cards and the old counter cards were discarded so that everything would fit. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE GAME, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s really just extra stuff that wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t needed.
This set is 100% compatible with the new Advance line, too.
The good news is that this thing will fit into a flat rate box so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship for $12 even though it weighs A TON!</notes>

    <notes>This includes the base game of Thunderstone, Doomgate Legion, Dragonspire, Heart of Doom, Thornwood Seige, Wrath of the Elements, Promo Pack #1 and the For the Dwarf promo set. All cards are sleeved with Ultra Pro Deck Protector sleeves. These are the same sleeves used by Magic and other CCG players for their decks and have a textured back to make shuffling easier. There are roughly 20 extra sleeves included as well to serve as replacements. The 2300 sleeves by themselves retail for $160, so this is a very good deal as long as you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind using yellow sleeves. :) All of the cards and other game components are stored in the Wrath of Elements, Doomgate Legion and Heart of Doom expansion boxes, the other boxes are not included as I did not keep them since everything fits nicely into the boxes I did keep. 
I am open to offers from buyers since I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to raise money to help pay my student loans. Need to sell some of my gaming stuff as soon as possible, so please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to make an offer on this or any of the games in my collection. </notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game of Thunderstone plus all 5 of the expansions that go with it.
So you get:

Thornwood Seige.
Wrath of the Elements.

Also I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m throwing in Promo pack #1 with the Harruli.
All 6 games are in 3 boxes with some room to spare, and the boxes are in very good condition. All the cards are like new sleeved from the get go.
All the cards and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a ton of cards are sleeved with Ultra Pro Sleeves blue and red. I also have 1 pack extra of blue and red 50 count each of Ultra Pro Sleeves.
The sleeves alone are worth $50.00 never mind the 6 games.

Thunderstone (original set)
Heart of Doom
Doomgate Legion
Wrath of the Elements
Thornwood Siege
Dragonspire
I have all the boxes, and can ship you all of them, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like, otherwise, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be shipped in two boxes (the Dragonspire box and one of the expansion boxes).  The cards and boxes are in mint condition as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played this 2-3 times. The cards, however, have been stored in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Epic Thunderstone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; order, so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re basically all mixed up between the different types of cards. Not a huge deal. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re still all there. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $60 plus shipping. Send me an email and I can get the shipping amount back to you. Let me know if you want all the original boxes or not.
Thanks.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $9.00 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

This expansion is being sold with the cards and rules only as part of a complete collection of Thunderstone (first edition). The set includes all of the base set, Wrath of the Elements, Doomgate Legion, Dragonspire, Thornwood Siege, and Heart of Doom, along with all promos. Boards, tokens, and rules included. Cards are in great shape without much wear. Everything is packaged into the Dragonspire and Thornwood Siege boxes, which is why I am not selling the sets separately.

    <notes>Thunderstone + Wrath of Elements + Doomgate Legion bundle. 
I bought the bundle off a friend a long time ago now, for quite a bit of money, but it just hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t got any play time. 
Its a great deck builder, but just not a fit for my group unfortunately. 
Looking to sell it to purchase something that will fit. :) 
All the cards (And there is a huge amount of them) fit neatly in to the Wrath Of Elements box, with dividers and sponges to stop them rattling around.
The box has some wear on it, but is still in a good condition, and the cards look great, probably played 3 times in 3 years.  Poor Game. :( 
The box is pretty heavy, so I expect a good £4-£7 delivery charge using My Hermes. But i can get a quote for you. 
PayPal preferred or we can do a bank transfer. 
Any questions then please let me know.</notes>

German version
includes the - not terribly common - expansion [thing=63214][/thing] (German version _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Zorn der Elemente_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) in the base game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box. (No expansion box included.)
Very good condition
(Once the card dividers are put into the box (which has been done), the lid doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t close perfectly any more. Also, you might notice that the card dividers could have been slightly bent, the cards themselves, however, aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t harmed by that at all.)
