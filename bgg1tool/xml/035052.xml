    <notes>Hi, I have opened the game, but not fully played it. BUT...I have added various NEW areas to the game board ( that were missing eg. like Malaysia where the UK should start in 1941 ! ) and some pacific islands. ALSO i have altered the set-up cards...BONUS _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  I have added approximately 150 other miniatures eg. Landing craft, other tanks _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; twin-engined aircraft. All at the right scale ( from otyher games ). The rule book is a mess, but you could get another ( download ? ).   I would much PREFER if you could come _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; collect _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; pay _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; then you could see the whole package.   Note that postage in the UK would be £11..abroad impossible..due to its weight</notes>

I will charge exact shipping plus $8 to cover handling and insurance. I apologize for the handling cost but it will be used to buy a brand-new, sturdy box for shipping.  I have a bunch of junk boxes in the basement but for this money you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll no doubt want a lower armor class around the game.

    <notes>Original in shrink wrap.  Also in the original WOTC shipping box.  I have openned the box for inspection and found that the shrink wrap at bottom was not complete.  Apparently some damage have been made BEFORE it is shipped to me.  However the outer cover of the game is very good.  Not a big deal unless you are going to keep it unopenned.
I am in Hong Kong.  Please consider the shipping cost as it is a big box.  I estimate that the shipping cost to US would be not less than USD70.  Contact me if you want better estimate.</notes>

    <notes>Axis and Allies Anniversary Edition is an outstanding game. With over 600 pieces, units from 7 different nations, and alternate setups for 1941 and 1942; this game is amazing! Many believe it to be the best Axis and Allies game yet. Plus, since it is a limited edition, it shouldn’t depreciate in value much - especially if you treat it well. But why buy a new version for $500 that will depreciate $200+ just by opening it? This game is meant to be played, so get it and play it.
Since this is a used game, you probably want to know what you are getting. I have counted everything including the IPCs (damage markers, researchers, VCs).  All of the original components (or exact equivalents in the case of dice and grey/red chips) are present except two: a black dice and a UK fighter.  The replacement black dice is not as rounded in the corners (most likely from another A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A game). The replacement UK fighter is from AA42. It is the same color and almost identical (It is the same size but it is slightly thinner and the wings don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the slight upward curve of the AA50 ones) 
Now we get to quality/wear. The plastic pieces are in good condition (one Italian artillery is slightly bent). The charts and IPCs are in good condition. Very little wear on the boards as well. They have even been cleaned a bit since the pictures. The box top has very little wear - some whitening in the corners. Three of the bottom corners show some more significant wear (see pictures) one of which is very slightly indented (not very much at all - you can hardly notice it on the pictures).
Pictures can be found at  http://profile.imageshack.us/user/pyoung20/
Shipping will be roughly $20. 
I will be out of town from the 26th - 1st so I will not be able to respond to any offers at that time (I might be able to check it on the 30th since I will be back for a short part of that day, but I am not sure).</notes>

Like NEW copy of Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Anniversary Edition.  Selling this for a friend.  Apparently this game is pretty rare and highly sought after considering he paid $350 for it on eBay not too long ago.  He discounted it down to $249.95 in hopes of selling it quickly.  The shrink has been removed but he said the game has never been played and also said it is verified complete.  
This is a beautiful copy of the game and will be perfect for either a collector or someone who actually wants to play the game!  MINT condition from a smoke-free home.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll say this first - the game is missing ONE German Sub (out of 14).  There is no chance this will ever affect the play of the game.  If it bothers you that much, swipe a sub from a copy of A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A42 because the pieces are exactly the same.  I counted everything else and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there.
That being said, this is a great clean copy.  Played 5-10 times.  Complete except for the sub.  Pieces and boxes are like new except for very light wear on the box and light wear on the rules and money.
Will ship anywhere, but international bidders beware that shipping with tracking is at least $40 and probably more. Buyer pays full shipping cost. All of my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games are for sale as well, so if some of those interest, let me know and we will negotiate a price.</notes>

    <notes>In like NEW/perfect condition and never played. Opened the box due to rumors that certain copies were not complete...its a good thing I inventoried the game as some parts were missing. I contacted AH and they sent me replacements for the missing parts. 
This game is 100% complete and in unplayed, MINT condition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just been sitting undisturbed on my shelf collecting dust since its release (even the box itself looks immaculate with no wear, dents, dings, etc). 
Stored w/care in a smoke free home.

    <notes>With pain in my heart I sell my copy of Axis. Removed the plastic, rest unplayed/ unpunched. Only problem the back of the box. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a hole in the backside. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s through, but I think you can solve this with tape. Contents not damaged.      
      
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also go to Essen this week. Handover there is also possible.

    <notes>I bought this game back in 2008. I have never played with it and it is in immaculate condition. I have opened it and punched out the tokens but i still have all the token cards and all the pieces can be seen back in the cards (see pics). This game is immaculate and has been stored away since 2008. This is as close to new as you can get for a game that has been opened. I bought it due to my interest of the second world war. I had every intention of playing with it but never found the time. The last picture shows the only wear the whole game has. </notes>

    <notes>Mint condition, never played, complete and pristine!  The only exception is the box.  I actually have two copies of this game and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling the unplayed (but punched) version.  Again, everything inside the box is pristine.
I will, however, let you choose which box you want.  The box on the right in every picture is the one that I have listed the price for.  It has some wear on the corners and the box top is pushed in a bit.  I am taking some measures to try to correct this, and during shipping I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll keep some padding inside the box lid to help prevent this from happening more.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like a somewhat nicer box (the one on the left in every picture), please add USD $50.
Again, you are buying the box on the right unless you add an additional $50:

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $25 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).

    <notes>This is the Axis and Allies Anniversary Edition.
I have to rate it very good as per site policy but considering this game has been played a few times I would almost want to call it as good as new.
The game is 100% complete (all 100% original Anniversary molds, no substitutes)
In fact overcomplete since I have more grey/red chips and for some reason both Italy and the United Kingdom have three extra ships.
You will never pay more for shipping than the actual price I have to pay, and the post office receipt can be produced if needed.
Only shipping to EU countries + Norway and Switzerland.</notes>

    <notes>The rare Axis and Allies Anniversary Edition. This version is very hard to come by and it includes Italy as a playable faction.
The game components are complete with one exception: One US infantry unit was missing from the start. Therefor I had an additional chinese infantry unit in it. So in total you get the same number of plastic pieces.
The game has been played three or four times. There is minor damage to the box corners. And there a scratches on the left and right edges of the top cover. (You can see them in the pictures.) The rule book is a little bit bended. Overall it is in good condition. Nothing else is broken or missing.
It is a very big box, so I am not sure right now how much shipping will be.</notes>

The game is still shrinkwrapped. On the bottom, one corner (if you look closely) has a 1/8 inch hole right at the corner. The box is very big, and if you turn it over there is a slight bowing on one side that I think is from the shrinkwrap being so tight. If you have any questions, please email. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>This is a copy of AA: Anniversary in very good condition; it has a little wear on the bottom (see pics) and one corner of the bottom box was split where the previous owner was none too careful when putting the lid on, no attempt was made to repair it.
This is a large and expensive game to ship in the US much less overseas, please do not waste yours and my time by requesting a shipping quote if you are not serious about paying a high amount for shipping.  My best guess for shipping USPS priority would hit $30 or $40 USD in the continental US, overseas shipping could easily be twice as high.
I would rather trade for this but will take cash; look at my wishlist for trade ideas.</notes>

    <notes>Selling most current version of the Anniversary Edition (purchased 2017).  Played it once (or twice) and just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to play it anymore.  Pretty much in like new condition.  Feel free to ask me any additional questions.
Shipping fee is extra, and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry about PayPal Fees.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take care of the difference.</notes>
