   <description>The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;no trump_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Based on the bestseller Wizard Card Game where correct predictions earn points, Fantasy Wizard re-imagines Wizard with sensational new characters and settings. Wizard apprentices develop their powers of premonition by predicting the exact number of tricks they can win in each round of this enchanting card game. Correct predictions earn points. Humans, dwarves, elves, and giants compete for power, but none can conquer the all-powerful Wizards in this dynamic new game of trump. The apprentice with the most points at the end of the game wins. Fantasy Wizard Card Game comes with a full-color deck of character cards, including four Wizard Cards, which always win, and four Jester cards, which always lose. When battling for tricks, these wild cards must be played strategically! </notes>

    <notes>This is the 2005 Amigo Wizard Jubilaumsedition Edition in a tin. The tin is still shrinkwrapped. I bought it for the wonderful artwork, but the family (we play this with all of the relatives on holidays) just wanted to stick with the boring artwork on the USA released editions that are just a normal deck of cards. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>U.S. Games Systems (USGWZ5)
More fun than Hearts and Rummy, award-winning Wizard is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;the Ultimate Game of Trump_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; the whole family can enjoy. The rules are easy to learn -- the strategy adds an exciting challenge. In Wizard, players try to win the exact number of tricks they bid. The Wizard deck is similar to a regular deck of playing cards with the addition of four Wizards and four Jesters. Jesters always lose and Wizards always win. In the first round, players start out with one card. In the second round, players are deal two cards, and so on, with each round becoming more challenging. When you make your exact bid, you earn points. If you take too many or too few tricks, you lose points. The special, custom Wizard Score Sheet helps players keep track of bids and points. Wizard Card Game can be played with 2-6 players. Instructions are in English, French, and Spanish. 2011 Winner Dr. Toy Best Classic Toy Award and Five-time winner Games 100 Selection. </notes>
