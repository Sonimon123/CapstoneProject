   <description>Epic Railroad Building in North America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

All cards, money and chips complete - though one chip is a slightly different color of white (it appears to be an extra). Puzzle-cut board, rulebook, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;how to play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; manual, pawns, crayons look hardly used. Gotta sell it to make room.</notes>

    <notes>Game in nearly perfect condition. I never played it. Bought a lot of a dozen games and only wanted one of them.
Money is untouched, board has never been written on, the original crayons are included and have never been drawn with. Looks like the game was punched out put on a shelf and never played. Only wear is on the box and only in upper left corner.
Can send pictures, you will not be displeased with the condition of this game.
I can look up the costs of shipping with your zip code to give you an exact price for shipping.</notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50
European Postage: £10.00
Rest of World Postage: £20.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000.

PAYMENT METHODS: 
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).

    <notes>Base Game plus bonus map!
Up for your review is a board game by Mayfair Games, 2002 - Empire Builder - COMPLETE/UNPLAYED. Outer Box is in very good condition with only very minimal shelfwear in the corners. Interior contents are in unplayed/unpunched condition. Everything still sealed and unpunched. Board is very clean and solid. NOTE: There is a small bit of sticker residue on (1) side of the box (about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 0.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in size).  Bottom box has some minimal shelfwear.  Also included as a bonus is an INCOMPLETE copy of Nippon Rails (map and instructions only, both in very clean condition).  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 4.75 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon</notes>

THIS ITEM IS RESERVED FOR bjlillo
Thanks for bidding on my Ninja Meeple Awareness auction item. Every bit helps me to fight back versus those little wooden eurowarriors.
Please confirm this purchase and since you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re local we can arrange a local delivery/pickup option.
Thanks again, and peace.

    <notes>English Mayfair edition with plastic chips.  Box has a split at top and has other minor scuffs/scrapes, but is structurally fine.  There is some light damage between some of the boards where they have been pressed together, but does not affect play.  Letting this go cheap if you would like to experience the game.  Also includes barely used box of erasable crayons.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition, very lightly played. Only fault is that the supplied crayon colours don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t match the player tokens, not a problem at all but need to mention it.
A great crayon rail game.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not on BGG that often so please email directly (speights101@virginmedia.com) as well so I definitely get your order.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Cards are still in shrinkwrap.
Box is no longer in shrink but unpunched/unused/unplayed.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
