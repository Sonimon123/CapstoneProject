    <notes>I sell my kickstarter version of Xenoshyft, shipped directly from CMON! It even includes 2 expansions, not usually part of all kickstarter versions as well:
grafting-laboratory-expansion
psychogenics-research-expansion
The reason i do this is because i didnt know i had been asked to add shipping costs to the pledge. They send me one email with the pledge manager (when i already completed the survey) and it went into my spam folder and CMON didnt inform me anytime later that i need to finalze my pledge. Now i am asked to pay nearly 50$ shipping to germany and VAT (about 30$). Shipping to US is only about 9$. So i sell my pledge and i am pretty annoyed by CMON. Couldnt they send out a small reminder? And i am by far not the only one with that problem, search bgg forums.</notes>

All contents including PLUS 6 Extra Xenosathem +6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, enough for 4 players to have maximum number of Xenosathem cards.
ALL CARDS SLEEVED IN ULTRA PRO PRO-FIT SLEEVES!
There is one Ajax with a ripped back, but CMON sent me a replacement. 9 Ajax_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the box.
Game has been played 2-3 times, and my gaming group did not like it. As a result, it needs a new home. All the cards have been treated with care. NO DAMAGE to any of the game pieces. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m super OCD about my boardgames, so you can be assured that you are receiving a quality used board game.
Shipping is $14 to anywhere in the US.
Payment through PayPal Gift ($41) OR PayPal Payment ($43).
US Buyers only please! Thank you.</notes>

    <notes>This is the KS edition that has all the extras including the Xenoshyft Sleeves. It has been sleeved and organized, and I even made an organizer for easier set up and play. Although this has been opened and set up, it has never been played. I have played my friends copy several times and he has the same edition, but has the extra 5-6 player boards that I dont have. If you purchased this, it is ready to be played and has everything but the 5-6 player board (which I wouldnt recommend). Photos will hopefully show you the organizer, since the game is scattered otherwise. Great game, great fun, and a thinker. Not always easy to win so if you like a challenge this is a good one.</notes>

    <notes>Never played (opened to verify content), perfect condition, Kickstarter Edition, with the Grafting lab and Psychogenics expansions. Also comes with 4 folding game board quality player boards, a neoprene rubber center playmat, an unopened Ajax Miniature, plus all Kickstarter stretch goals and exclusive cards. Far superior to the retail components (which are also included). These components are nice enough that I suggest getting a KS copy over retail anyway that you can, even if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not mine! 
I Prefer local cash payment pickups, but I am more than happy to ship. Buyer would be responsible for shipping. By default I typically mail at the cheapest rate which includes insurance and tracking, but as long as these are included, I will ship anyway requested. I may also consider a cash + trade offer, but the likelihood is low since I would rather sell. If you have questions, please geekmail me. Please only serious offers, my price is pretty firm. Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>I absolutely love this game, but find myself playing it on tablet more these days. The game has been played only twice and everything is in really good condition, except the game box that is dented from one corner (happened during original transport). This is a great game and I cannot recommend it enough! 
This listing is not for the item listed only, but the whole set, which includes:
+ XenoShyft Onslaught (Kickstarter Base Set)
+ Kickstarter Exclusive Cards
+ Kickstarter Exclusive Foil Hero Cards
+ Kickstarter Exclusive Foil Prototype Cards
+ Kickstarter Exclusive Foil Boss Cards
+ Heavy Cardboard Folding Player Lanes
+ Grafting Laboratory (Mini-Expansion)
+ Psychogenics Research (Mini-Expansion)
+ 5-6 Player Expansion (Mini-Expansion)
+ R.O.D. Heroic Paratrooper (Very Rare Promo Card)
Basically the set includes EVERYTHING that is gameplay related that was released during the Kickstarter campaign + the very rare R.O.D. Heroic Paratrooper card from WatchItPlayed. Note that it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include the Nortec Commander miniature that was broken and missing parts in most copies that was shipped. I threw that away as it was the cheapest and worst quality miniature I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen from CoolMiniOrNot. This set does not include Hive expansion that was released recently.
Every card in the game is sleeved, but not using the Kickstarter sleeves (which were in bad quality). Instead the sleeves used are premium sleeves from Arcane Tinmen. All components are fit in the main box (without the insert) and organized in logical plastic bags.
Please note that this is a heavy box and I will be able to provide you shipping quote once you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve made the initial order. Please let me know the country, I am willing to ship worldwide and always ship with a tracking number.</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;It started out like any other job. Hit the planet, rip the rocks, go home and get paid. But this time we dug too deep, woke something up, and now, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just trying to survive long enough to get out of these beasts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; hive..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; In XenoShyft Onslaught, players take on the role of a commander in the NorTec Corporation. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re tasked with defending your division of the NorTec base as wave after wave of horrific aliens attempt to destroy the base and end NorTec_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s strip mining operation. While XenoShyft Onslaught has deck-building elements, it is not your average deck-building game. Instead XenoShyft plays like a popular tower defense game found on mobile devices. Using a wide array of troops, weapons, armors, and technology cards, players must last 9 rounds as the alien hordes bombard the NorTec base in increasingly difficult waves. Working together to fight the onslaught of beasts and creatures from the depths will take everything you have in your arsenal otherwise you and your fellow soldiers will not survive.</notes>

- Mayday Games Standard 63.5x88mm Card sleeves (all cards are sleeved)
- Card storage box to hold all cards
This item can be purchased with my listing of Xenoshyft: Dreadmire (https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1271739) for a $10 discount overall and to save on shipping. Dreadmire includes the following:
- Base game
- All Kickstarter stretch goals (over 125 additional cards, resource playmat)
- All cards still in shrink wrap
- Card storage box to hold all cards
PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING:
Send me a GeekMail message before you purchase Onslaught, Dreadmire, or both. We will need to figure out various logistics, such as:
- Do you want the insert that the game came with? (I removed the one from the Onslaught box, though I still have it if needed.)
- Do you want both game boxes if purchasing Onslaught and Dreadmire? (Both Onslaught and Dreadmire are stored in the Onslaught box now, though each is separated into individual card storage boxes.)
- Do you want to keep the card sleeves for the Onslaught cards?
- Calculate shipping rates for individual vs. combined purchase
--------

    <notes>This is a full kickstarter version of the game, includes everything other than an Ajax miniature. Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what you get with the base game
- 6 premium player boards made of thick cardboard
- neoprene mat to set up the card stacks on
- basic cards to add 5-6th player
- kickstarter card pack with additional aliens, troops and equipment
- foil card pack with heroic troops, legendary equipment and alien bosses
- Psychogenics lab expansion (shrink wrapped)
- Grafting lab (shrink wrapped)
I will also add a Hive alien expansion pack that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve bought separately but didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t open.
One of the corners of the box cover was damaged because there was too much kickstarter stuff crammed into the box, otherwise everything is in great condition. 
I will ship to anywhere in the world but the costs vary, so better pm me for the shipping cost first.</notes>
