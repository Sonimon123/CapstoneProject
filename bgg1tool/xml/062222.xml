   <description>Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Colors: Napoleonics allows you to re-fight epic battles of the Napoleonic era. In this core volume, the focus is on the French and the British, two bitter rivals in the struggle for European preeminence during the time of Napoleon._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As with other games in the Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Colors genre, units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered. The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The board in this game has one section that tore away from the rest of the board.  But there is a completely new replacement board in shrink wrap that will come with this game (I can leave out the torn board if you would prefer, or if you would like both, you are welcome to them).
All blocks are stickered, the spare stickers are in the box.  All blocks are in bags.
This game has been played twice, and everything is in very good condition.
I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see myself playing this much with Battlelore on the shelf.</notes>

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage will normally be by courier 3/5 working days within the UK unless otherwise agreed with a charge of £4.99.
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £3.49 (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. 
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Note: GMT First Printing of C_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;C: Napoleonics.
Game is unpunched and unplayed.  All countersheets are unpunched.  The card deck hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been opened.  The blocks have NOT been stickered.  The block stickers (and the spares) are still on the original sticker sheets.  Everything is present in the game (including the player aids, scenarios and rules).
The rules have been looked at during the past year.
The box appears to be in very good to fine condition.  Just small scuff marks here and there on the box.
Game comes from non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>Brand New, In Shrink, Just In Time For Christmas! Of course, no blemishes/dents/tears in shrinkwrap (if there were, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have mentioned them... but I figure specifically stating so saves concerned buyers a GM to confirm).
Shipping: the price I pay to Canada Post, FedEx, or UPS (your choice of company and method) is the price you pay.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge extra for handling or packing materials.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere in the world (yes, that includes Brazil)... but all buyers should be aware that I assume no liability for parcels when they leave my hands.  Insurance recommended... particularly for international buyers.
Payment:  I am an L5R addict, and I typically buy my booster boxes through CoolStuffInc, so I would prefer a CSI Gift Certificate.  If the buyer would prefer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also accept Paypal, provided the buyer covers any fee that may apply.
Miscellaneous: BGG will receive its 3%, of course. Item will ship within 3 days of payment clearing. Any questions, please feel free to PM!</notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT1014)
The Napoleonic historical period has always been one of our favorites and was actually the second historical game that we developed using the Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors system. The Wars of Napoleon rules at first glance may seem more complex than other Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors games, but if you are familiar with the game system, you are only a few short steps away from taking Command. Even if you have never played before, learning the fundamentals of the game system is straightforward and will be an enjoyable endeavor. For the game group in Orlando, Wars of Napoleon is one of our favorites. There is a wealth of subtle and bold features that set it apart from other historical periods and it truly embraces the tactical doctrines of France and the various nations that fought against Napoleon. </notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT1014)
The Napoleonic historical period has always been one of our favorites and was actually the second historical game that we developed using the Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors system. The Wars of Napoleon rules at first glance may seem more complex than other Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors games, but if you are familiar with the game system, you are only a few short steps away from taking Command. Even if you have never played before, learning the fundamentals of the game system is straightforward and will be an enjoyable endeavor. For the game group in Orlando, Wars of Napoleon is one of our favorites. There is a wealth of subtle and bold features that set it apart from other historical periods and it truly embraces the tactical doctrines of France and the various nations that fought against Napoleon. </notes>

    <notes>*** With every sale we donate a percentage to the Veterans Support Foundation (including this sale). ***
Wargame Depot has donated over $7,500 to this wonderful cause thanks, largely, to the wonderful Boardgamegeek community. Thank you so much for your continued support of Wargame Depot which has allowed us to give generously to the VSF.
Mint, in shrink copy available.  No dings, no dents, or anything wrong with the game.  Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
$12 shipping to US - write me for a quote to the rest of the world.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so a purchase from me will always be packed professionally and I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
And if you want this game plus anything else that I am selling on BGG, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course be happy to add other items on in order to save you on shipping!
North Carolina residents pay 7% sales tax.

This is for the base game as well as the four expansions to include the Spanish, Russian, Austrian, and Prussian Army expansions.  All of the blocks have had the stickers applied (I believe carefully but this is subjective - saving you hours of time to apply these to all of the blocks in this set.    I cannot confirm that I kept any extra unused blocks or extra charts but all of the listed blocks to have stickers applied are included).   I only have the base game box that includes the charts, rules, scenarios as well as terrain tiles, many of the base game blocks and moocounters, dice.  The rest of the blocks have been bagged by nationality.   Buyer to pay shipping (priority mail) plus pay pal fee.</notes>

Buyer will pay shipping and packaging costs (not my time, but the box and bubble wrap). If you have a shipping preference, geek mail me and let me know.
Also, I live in the 21209 zip code (Baltimore, MD), so let me know if you would prefer to pickup the game and save us both time on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>No Shrink wrap, no damaged box. Open the box and start to play condition. I put all the stickers on (will save you the time _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; effort), but I never played it. Must start selling part of my collection. Stored in a smoke and pet free home. Heavy game so I will be mailing USPS Flat Rate shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Played a few times, but all components are like new. I have made the custom foam insert (I used some of the spare stickers for it) to hold all the blocks neatly. Pictures are failing to upload for some reason so here are the links on dropbox:
