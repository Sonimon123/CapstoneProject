    <notes>I have this in hand and it is ready to ship.  I backed on Kickstarter so this includes the base game, Kickstarter extras, and some add-ons.  Specifically, here is what is included:
Project: ELITE base game
Project: ELITE - Alien Pack (Kickstarter Extras in their own box)
Project: ELITE - Sandman
Project: ELITE - Rahdox
Project: ELITE - Mega Boss Bundle (two extra bosses, each in its own box)
Two extra sets of Custom Dice, which allow the game to be played by up to six players
I have opened each of these but everything is unpunched and in like-new condition.  The game is unplayed and all the plastic components are still in their original bags.  I was really excited about the game when I backed it but have since played some real-time games with my family and they did not like them at all.
You can check out the Kickstarter campaign here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/241478362/project-elite/description.  I backed at the $85 level and then added additional items.  
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big box, so shipping will be $20.  I can usually ship the day after receiving payment.  The game will be coming from Georgia (30720).  Please let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Complete Project: ELITE kickstarter pledge with all stretch goals. Will ship UPS Ground.
In a post apocalyptic scenery, an alien civilization has invaded Earth. Players work together as part of a special ops team with the code name _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ELITE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. They are dispatched to high priority missions protecting objectives and defending vital targets against the alien invaders.
Project: ELITE is a co-operative, real-time, speed-dice, tactical, tower-defense-like game in which players roll dice with symbols as fast as they can allowing them to do various actions with their character on the game board. They move around shooting and cutting through waves of aliens blocking their advance while at the same time they try to complete objectives that will bring them to victory.
The game consists of a number of real-time 2-minute Rounds (depending on the scenario) separated by an AI Alien phase where aliens perform abilities, advance towards their goal and receive reinforcements.
The constant performance of actions through dice rolling combined with an innovative combat/movement system result in a mix of intense gameplay that offers countless hours of fun.
What really makes Project: ELITE unique is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Alien Move_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; symbol that appears on one side of each of the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dice and forces him/her to move an alien towards their goal.
The end-result is a real-time tactical board game where friend and foe are on an constant motion trying to prevail.</notes>

    <notes>Complete Project: ELITE kickstarter pledge with all stretch goals. Will ship UPS Ground.
In a post apocalyptic scenery, an alien civilization has invaded Earth. Players work together as part of a special ops team with the code name _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ELITE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. They are dispatched to high priority missions protecting objectives and defending vital targets against the alien invaders.
Project: ELITE is a co-operative, real-time, speed-dice, tactical, tower-defense-like game in which players roll dice with symbols as fast as they can allowing them to do various actions with their character on the game board. They move around shooting and cutting through waves of aliens blocking their advance while at the same time they try to complete objectives that will bring them to victory.
The game consists of a number of real-time 2-minute Rounds (depending on the scenario) separated by an AI Alien phase where aliens perform abilities, advance towards their goal and receive reinforcements.
The constant performance of actions through dice rolling combined with an innovative combat/movement system result in a mix of intense gameplay that offers countless hours of fun.
What really makes Project: ELITE unique is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Alien Move_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; symbol that appears on one side of each of the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dice and forces him/her to move an alien towards their goal.

In excellent condition and has the replacement minis.
From a smoke and pet-free household.
UK shipping is likely to be £13 via Royal Mail or £8.50 via Myhermes - would need to confirm this on dispatch. Large and heavy so probably precludes international shipping but ask if you are interested.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, inventoried the minis and such, but cards still in shrink, unpunched, and unplayed. The box that this was shipped in was destroyed during shipment and I feared the worst - but luckily, the only damage I see is some white corners on the main game box. This is from the Kickstarter, and includes all the stretch goals but does not include the add ons that could be purchased separately. So this includes [thing=182054][/thing], [thing=182057][/thing] and [thing=182056][/thing]. I did pay the extra $10 to get 2 more sets of the player dice, so this copy can play up to 6. If you have any questions regarding what this includes, please ask. English first edition (2016) Drawlab Entertainment

    <notes>I am selling a KS version of Project: Elite and all expansions for it. The miniatures are updated molds.
Expansions:
Alien Pack
Adrenaline
Megaboss Pack
Base box and cover have some tearing, Alien pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bottom also has some tearing, Adrenaline is in good shape. Components: missing 1 hit dice (doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay 99% of the time), missing some chits, which is annoying but doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t matter much gameplay-wise. 
I will ship this to anywhere in the world, but it may be quite pricey (boxes weigh 5-6 kilos) - PM me for shipping estimates.</notes>

    <notes>This package includes Project: ELITE (the base set), the Alien Pack, as well as all of the Kickstarter rewards (though it does not include the extra mega boss add-ons). The components are complete, except instead of 22 shooter minis, the package includes 23 shooter minis, and instead of 22 runner minis, the package includes 21 runner minis. The base game came with 20 runners and shooters, the extra few were Kickstarter rewards.
I also have the expansion to this game for sale under the Project ELITE: Adrenaline page on Geek Market. I will give discounted shipping if both are purchased by the same person.
The item is shipping from PA 19520.
The dimensions of the two game boxes are just under 13_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 13_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 7_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, and just under 8 lbs.
4 day shipping to Los Angeles via FedEx Ground would cost $16.71
5 day shipping to New York City via USPS ParcelSelect would cost $8.72.
I can give a cost estimate for shipping outside of the US.
The components are in good condition.
Here is a list of all included components. The package is complete with all original components (except for the 1 extra shooter and 1 less runner than the kickstarter reward described).
