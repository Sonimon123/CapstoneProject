   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Zombicide: Black Plague takes the zombie apocalypse into a fantastical medieval setting! The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Zombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Knight Level Kickstarter and all Kickstarter exclusives associated with it. I received this in early June. Opened it and inventoried the items and looked at the pieces. The base game has been played once and is bagged. This is super cool, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure I can get the gaming group needed, so I decided to put it up here if anyone was interested. Feel free to ask any questions.

Condition: We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played the game several times. Everything is in good condition.  The game/storage - all the plastic has been broken down, everything stored in bags to fit everything into the two boxes. Good guys and game setup in Black Plague box, bad games and extra tiles in Wulfsburg box. 
The Black Plague box corner (where my finger is pointing in the picture) split and is taped up. It split in a stupid error as we we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re trying to figure out how to get everything into two boxes. Everything fits now, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played and packed the game several times, easily in the boxes.</notes>

    <notes>**THIS IS ___NOT___ THE FULL ZOMBICIDE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!**
This is an assortment of 19 Zombicide BP survivors that I simply will never have time to paint. Some are Kickstarter exclusives, some are from artist packs, and some are from the expansions.  I just have too many survivors to make use of so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like these to go to a good home where they will be enjoyed!
Survivors included:
  - Falstaff (KS exclusive)
  - Evil Troy (KS exclusive), plus necromancer cards
  - Troy (KS exclusive)
  - Hitch (KS exclusive)
  - Lucas (KS exclusive)
  - Piper (KS exclusive)
  - James (KS exclusive)
  - Paul (KS exclusive)
  - Tucker (hero box 1)
  - Arnaud (hero box 1)
  - Julian (hero box 1)
  - Theo (Wulfsburg)
  - Mizar (Paul Bonner artist box)
  - Marcus (Karl Kopinski artist box)
  - Milo (Naiade artist box)
  - Ostokar (Naiade artist box ), plus necromancer cards
  - Cyrine (John Howe artist box), plus big base and Dragon Aura equipment card
  - The Blackheart (Stefan Kopinski artist box), plus necromancer cards
A picture of the survivors included is here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/42etxc5xd3axw9f/zbp-for-sale.jpg?dl=0
Note, 12 of the 17 minis have already been primed in white! This is great if you want to pain them... or you could strip the paint with nail polish remover or something similar.
All survivors come with their ID card in multiple languages (whatever it came with in the Kickstarter), plus any extra equipment/necromancer cards as listed above. Items will NOT come in their original packaging.
Ships to the US from zip 21045, probably in a flat rate $5 box.

------------------------
This is a Knight Pledge that includes the base game, Wulfsburg, and all the stretch goal content.
It also includes the following addons:
Deadeye Walkers
Murder of Crowz
NPC-2
NOTE: The $290 price tag includes the above addons which cost ~$61 at CoolStuff. That means you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting a Knight Pledge for $229.
Cards have been sleeved and are in perfect condition. Only played a few times.
I have a Massive Darkness pledge with the Zombicide Black Plague crossover addon that is due me. Would be able to set something up to sell that to the buyer as well, if interested.
Shoot me a geek mail if you have any questions :)</notes>

    <notes>Zombicide: Black Plague - KNIGHT Pledge - over $500 in retail value
Everything BUT the base game!
Zombicide: Black Plague is a standalone cooperative boardgame for 1 to 6 players that brings the relentless zombie-killing action of Zombicide into a brand new fantasy setting! Players control a party of survivors as they fight to rid the land of an invasion of zombies controlled by the game itself. Survivors find weapons, learn spells, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!
This is for everything from the Kickstarter Pledge, but the base game.
All Items are sealed, never opened in shrink, at hand and ready to ship (see pictures):

    <notes>I am selling my Kickstarter copy of Zombicide: Black Plague. The game is in fantastic condition. The materials have been punched out and organized, and it was played twice. I have all the original packaging for all the sets. The only _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;damage_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to the game is I wrote on 2 boxes cardboard boxes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Brown Box 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Brown Box 2._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; The purpose of that was to quickly find hero locations, which I created a guide for since there are so many in the set. I will include 2 copies of the Hero finding guide so you can easily figure out where hero mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are located. 
Zombicide: Black Plague
Zombicide: Wulfsburg
Hero Box 1
Huntsman Pack
Knight Pack
NPC-1 Pack
Zombie Bosses Abomination Pack
Paul Bonner Pack
Naiade Pack
Marc Simonetti Pack

You can check the kickstarter page for what all this entails if you want to know specific minis, but basically, everything I got in the kickstarter as rewards would be included with this package. 
Happy to provide pictures of any and all contents to interested parties.

The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!

The game was never played, I opened it and looked at all the stuff but never ended up playing it. It is in all the original boxes but if you want I can try and condense them into as few boxes as possible for shipping. Shipping shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be that much for the amount of stuff included. Any additional questions email me thanks.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a knight-level kickstarter pledge which includes the base game, wulfsburg expansion, all stretch goals and the following additional expansions/additions:
Deadeye Walkers
Murder of Crowz
NPC-2
3D doors
All cards (except heroes) sleeved with FFG
Plano to store zombies
Plano to store all miscellaneous bits
Plano to store player pegs and bases (this helps so much)
Everything else bagged and organized
Printouts of all ability names for ease of play
Played about 5-6 times, in excellent condition.
I have everything fit in the base game box and wulfsburg box nicely and can ship just those two for $30, or include all original boxes for an additional cost since the weight and dimensions will be much greater. I will ship via USPS.
Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!</notes>

Shipping/Pickup
Happy to consider posting this at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense but just a warning that the two original KS boxes they came in are pretty big (36x36x38cm each) and together  weigh about 10-11kg. Otherwise, pickup in Canberra region or Sydney (I am in Newtown every few weekends).
Payment via bank deposit, paypal (allowing for any fees) or cash on pickup.</notes>

    <notes>Zombicide Black Plague complete set used, but very good condition...One of the extra abomination miniature boxes has an internal split end if I remember right, but other than that very nice, and organized. Planos used to sort enemy and terrain miniatures included.
Includes the following. Literally everything that was available during the kickstarter (though there have been a couple of promos since then I think; if so, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not included). Individual prices are only there to show what the KS cost was, selling full set for $375, not interested in breaking it up:
Pledge level w/kickstarter extreas $150 $150.00 1 $150.00 
Special Guest Carl Critchlow $20.00 1 $20.00 
Special Guest Karl Kopinski $20.00 1 $20.00

Extra Tiles Pack $25.00 1 $25.00 
Deck Holders Set $10.00 1 $10.00 
Counter Base Pack $10.00 1 $10.00 
Plastic Token Pack $18.00 1 $18.00 
3D Doors $18.00 1 $18.00 
Murder Of Crowz $20.00 1 $20.00 
Grom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Thalia $18.00 1 $18.00
I am not interested in breaking up the set or selling the kickstarter stuff separately.
Currently, everything is in the 2 main boxes (base game and wulfsburg), a few planos (included, for enemies and doors), the abomination box, except the the unopened tiles are in their shrink. Shipping is probably around $30 for everything as listed above. The other boxes (such as the now empty hero boxes) are available, but would most likely cost another $20-$30 to ship (there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a lot of them).</notes>

- _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Huntsman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pack (Kickstarter exclusives and extras)
- Hero Box-1 expansion
- Zombie Bosses expansion
- Notorious Plagued Characters (NPC-1) expansion
- Paul Bonner special guest character expansion
- Marc Simonetti special guest character expansion
- Naiade special guest character expansion
- Folding dice tower
A real bargain as the Huntsman pack can go for silly money on eBay (well over £100) and each expansion can be 30-40 in UK stores (when they have stock). It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only the fact that I always intended to sell this as a bundle and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really want the hassle of splitting it up that means I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m still offering this as a bundle.
Note that shipping may be fairly costly, as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about 6kg and 36x36x36cm.</notes>

    <notes>Zombicide: Black Plague + Wulfsburg expansion
I am reluctantly offering my Zombicide: BP games for sale. They are amazing games, but I need space for new games and hope they will find a new home for fun game nights.
Both games are in very good condition, 100% complete and from a none smoker/pet free household. The boxes have some minor damage which you can see in the photos. 
Paypal +£3 or free as PayPal family and friends payment.</notes>

    <notes>Hello,
I am selling the following Zombicide Black Plague Kickstarter Knights BUNDLE with add-ons (no separation):
Black Plague - English first edition) 
Black Plague Special Guest Box - Marc Simonetti
Black Plague Special Guest Box - Naiade
Black Plague Special Guest Box - Paul Bonner
Black Plague Zombie Bosses Abomination Pack
Black Plague - Deadeye Walkers
Black Plague - hero Box 1
Black Plague - Huntsman Pack
Black Plague - Knight Pack
Black Plague - Murder of the Crowz
Black Plague - NPC 1
Black Plague - NPC 2
Black Plague - Wolfsburg
Any other KS exclusives for the Knight Pledge that I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t list. 
For specific links to each of these products, feel free to go to my collection page and scroll to the bottom. Or just search them individually. 
All items are LIKE NEW. Items have been removed from shrink and were gently played with 6 times (mostly solo). I am selling these because as much as I love zombicide, I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t had time to get this to the table as much as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like (other hobbies/ time obligations). 
All contents are condensed to the base box, expansion box, and the kickstarter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pizza box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. This means that any other boxes (such as the physical boxes for guest boxes) are not included but all the contents of those boxes are included. The contents of each box are organized with plano containers which will be included in the sale. 
Shipping to US only, mostly because I have been burned on international shipments in the past and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather not mess with it. If someone is very highly motivated to have this ship international then I may consider it. 
For shipping estimates, send me a PM. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the exact box dimensions and weight available yet, but I will get that figured out shortly and will be able to provide a quote. If I had to guess, shipping Massive Darkness was around $40-55 to most zip codes and i_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d expect this to be somewhat similar. 
Local pick is available -- Indianapolis, IN. 
Also feel free to PM me with any picture requests. 
Last note - the purchase price is the expected NET amount via paypal or Venmo. This means that I ask for you to cover the paypal fee or use a method that incurs no fee. In the spirit of full disclosure, using friends and family option does not provide paypal buyer protection. I will be shipping the item regardless (check my profile...i love board games and not out to scam anyone). I always recommend using the 3% fee route to be safe, but I provide both options if someone wants to skip the fee. If you have any reservations about this, please pay the 3% extra fee--that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s there for.</notes>

Zombicide: Black Plague Wulfsburg Expansion
Abomination Bosses expansion
Deadeye Walkers expansion
