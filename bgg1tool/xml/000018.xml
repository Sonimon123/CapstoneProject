   <description>The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins.

Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;registers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hardly possible to ship this game in a small package by surface mail (up to 2.000 gr) for 8.20 Euro to Europe or 12.30 to anywhere in the world. I really can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t recommend this kind of shipping only wrapped in paper.
recommende shipping (with a sturdy box around)
air mail package up to 5.000 gr.
Europe - EU 16.50 Euro
US/Kanada: 29.00 Euro
to Japan or Korea: 35.00 Euro
other destinations: please ask
If you buy my Robo Rally Crash _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Burn (Amigo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s edition) too, you will receive a 10 Euro discount (Euro 90 instead of 100). This two games will fit into one package by airmail.
Euro countries: I really prefer bank transfair using IBAN and BIC-Code. EU must be good for something ;-)

I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sold many games on BGG, but you can check my feedback on eBay if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.  My username is gabeschw, and I currently have a feedback score of 189 with 100% positive reviews. 
Shipping (to U.S. only) by Priority Mail is $10.  I greatly prefer Paypal, but will take a money order as well.   </notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill (AVH 95039 / WOC 217580000)
A Frenzied Race Filled with Computer Driven Chaos!
At the far end of the galaxy lies a fully automated grid-widget factory. As one of the factory_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s eight redundant supercomputers, you have a lot of responsibility - and even more free time. When boredom creeps into your circuits, you and the other computers have a little fun at the factory_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense. Pulling defective robots out of the maintenance bay, you pit them against one another in a destructive race across the dangerously cluttered and ever-changing factory floor. One robot will wind up in the winner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s circle - the rest go on the scrap heap.</notes>

    <notes>BUNDLE!
This includes the complete contents of:
1) Robo Rally: Wizards of the Coast (not Avalon Hill) version
2) Armed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dangerous expansion
3) Crash _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Burn expansion
4) Grand Prix expansion
A great game, it just never hit the table very much.  The contents are therefore in excellent condition.  The cards are clean inside the still-crisp tuckboxes. The counters for Armed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dangerous are unpunched.  All 17 boards are clean and undamaged.  The boxes do show some shelf wear, plus a small rip on the side of the Armed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dangerous lid.
I also have a copy of the new Avalon Hill version which I will sell for $30.  I had considered merging the best elements of both games; however, an upcoming move has forced me to thin down my game collection.</notes>

Imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a supercomputer. Now imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...</notes>

    <notes>This is for Wizards of the Coast version of:
Armed and Dangerous
Radioactive
Crash and Burn
Grand Prix
Some shelf wear on both and Armed and Dangerous has a small split down side bottom, but the box is otherwise sound.
I will upload pics later or can at request.
These are heavy when all combined, so expect shipping in US to be ~$20 (depending on location)
I ship fast and can combine shipping with other purchases.

    <notes>Avalon Hill 1994 edition
NOT sealed, but components in basically mint condition. Box however has minor top concave from sitting on a shelf and a crease in one corner. Has only been played 5-6 times or so, pieces will be bagged to prevent shipping damage.
All pieces intact, has been stored in a dry/smoke-free environment and handled with best of care. Pieces will be bagged to prevent damage.
Buyer to pay shipping up to $8 for basic shipping, I will cover any additional expenses unless you request a more expensive/faster shipping method. Check out my other games and save by combining shipping.
If you send check, I will wait for it to clear before I send the game.</notes>

    <notes>This is the AH 2005 edition.  The game is new and sealed in shrinkwrap.  The shrink has a couple of small tears in it, but the game is still sealed.
There is some minor dishing of the box top, and some whiting on the bottom corners.  One corner has rubbed through so that brown cardboard is showing.  Send me your zip code, and I can give you a postage estimate.
Be aware that this weighs over 4 pounds so shipping internationally is going to be over $40, and shipping within the US will probably be at least $10.</notes>

*** Comes with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Grand Prix_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; expansion. ***
Robots have been painted (not the best job but better than I could do so couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t complain).
Heavy so may have to ship in two parcels outside the UK (to keep under the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;over-2kg-ripoff-postage-in-the-uk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; hurdle).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not on BGG that often so please email directly (otagoexile@yahoo.co.uk) as well so I definitely get your order.
 
Cheques preferred, will need to pay all fees for any electronic payment.

    <notes>Avalon Hill- Roborally
Language: English
Players: 2 to 8
Age: 12+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 1.340 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a supercomputer. Now imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...

    <notes>2005 Avalon Hill edition.
Box shows some wear, but inside components are in very good condition.  The robot bases are painted in different colors to easily distinguish them.
If you purchase multiple games from me, I will be happy to combine the games together in one box to help you save on shipping costs.
Local pickup is available around Los Angeles, CA.
I only ship through USPS, and I charge actual shipping cost plus $1 for handling.</notes>

    <notes>Comments:
Offering the much-desired version with the metal robots.  WOC5002.
Also, see my offer for expansion boards.
Condition Notes:
Played once and in excellent shape.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

    <notes>2005 Avalon Hill edition. Complete. Over all in very good condition. Box lid slightly bends inward but otherwise the box is in very good shape with some light wear. Components themselves in very good condition.
I do not add handling fees or over charge on shipping, I only charge the exact amount.  Geek mail me for a shipping quote. By default I ship USPS priority mail, and my processing time is very quick. I will ship parcel post by request, however, I can only ship parcel post on Saturdays.
I will combine shipping. Click on my user name above to see any other games I am selling.

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC217580000)
Imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a supercomputer. Now imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that... </notes>

    <notes>This is the 2005 Avalon Hill edition
I am selling this game in order to make room on my shelves for games that might get played more often, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pricing it to move because I care more about getting it out of my place than turning a profit. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added a good bit of value, too! Read on for more.
Condition
---
This game has been played, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve cared for it well and it is in superb condition.  It has been kept in a non-smoking home in a low-humidity state.  The box lid is bowed in a little bit, and has been since it was in shrink, which appears to be very common for this edition.
Components
---
All game components and manuals are present and in perfectly pristine condition. Furthermore, the following extras are included:
-A plano box to hold all tokens and figures.
-Cards bound into a deck using non-adhesive Amazing Tape.
Shipping
---
I will ship this via USPS in a flat rate box (I think it will fit), to the USA only for $15. If you are outside of the US and really want this game, feel free to drop me a GM, and we can discuss it. I only hesitate because I rarely ship out of the country. Free pickup is available if you happen to be in Albuquerque, NM.
Payment
---
I accept payment through Paypal only. Please do not send payment to my personal email address (the one listed when you make the purchase). I will provide a Paypal address to use when I confirm the sale.</notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast Second Edition. In shrink. The box is a bit dented in the middle (probably because other boxes were put on the game). At the back, the shrink is removed in the upper left corner to put in a Dutch translation of the rules (dated 1997). In that corner the box is a bit scuffed. Otherwise in perfect condition. See pictures.

    <notes>Original Wizards of the Coast 1994 edition with pewter robots.  Game is complete.  Box has shelf wear (fading) but is in great structural condition.  Orders cards have been well used, but are not ripped/torn/bent.  All other components, including boards, minis, counters, and chits are in excellent condition.
I also have the cards/counters/rule book for Roborally: Armed and Dangerous - all in excellent condition.  Will sell them along with the base game for $10.
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.

    <notes>Includes Radioactive and Grand Prix expansion boards.  Game is in great shape - practically new, only a few of the counters punched, but box has slight tear along one corner.  
AT THIS POINT it is missing the zinc robot figurines, but all the counters are there.  I am pretty sure that the figurines are in with another game, and will update the listing when I find them.

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC217580000)
Imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a supercomputer. Now imagine that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory.

    <notes>The game box has some minor corner/edge/shelf wear.  The top of the box is caved in slightly (this is the fault of the box design/materials and the fact that the box is way too big and mostly empty space - the box arrived to me new in this caved in condition back in 2010) but is structurally sound.
The components are pristine and the cards/flags are stored in clear plastic boxes.  
Also includes Robot Ability cards printed thru Artscow.</notes>

    <notes>Roborally in GOOD condition- all components are included and in very good condition (only the cards show minor wear around the edges)
The box has normal shelf wear along the edges.  The top of the box bows in slightly from games being stacked on top.  Again, the game looks GOOD and all the components are there, most of which are in very good condition.  
Game will ship via FedEx Ground for $5 flat rate to continental US normal address.

USPS calculator shows $9.90 for shipping...I know it has taken me a while to get this out. If shipping ends being more than that, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover it. Please note as described in auction, box has some wear, mainly a dent in one corner. All components are fine.
Thanks!
