   <description>Britannia is a historical board game that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s history in important ways, creating countless interesting _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;what if?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; scenarios. What if Boudicca_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

square counter for Roman forts, six sided for rulers for most groups, one round for most of groups for population, turn marker, and, some white blanks, total is about 260,
counters appear to be all there,
5 white dice,

    <notes>Avalon Hill edition of the game.
Box shows little wear. All counters unpunched. Vicory Point Cards are not separated yet. 2 of the VP cards have a sleight marking of an old rubber band.
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>This is the classic Avalon Hill bookcase edition (in my opinion the best version).
CONDITION: Like new, contents mint, unused and complete, with unpunched counters and uncut cards. The box has some tape marks (AH used tape to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;seal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; the boxes in the last few months of production) and a dent on one corner.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £10.50
Rest of World Postage: £19.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

PAYMENT METHODS:

Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months! There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).

    <notes>Avalon Hill Edn.  This game is in pretty rough shape...I bought it on ebay and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ever played it.  Box is beat up with corners/sides taped shut, lots of wear on box, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still sturdy.  The contents are better--some cards/tokens punched, others unpunched.  Includes rules.  Overall, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a collector interested in a great-looking game, this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the copy for you.  But if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to play a classic game, and want a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, this might be what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for.
Shipping via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation.  Buyer pays $11.00 shipping.  Shipping in the US only...payment via paypal only.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - Britannia
Language: English
Players: 3 to 5
Age: 12+
Duration: 3 to 5 hour
Weight: 1.920 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Britannia is a historical board game that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066. Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain’s history in important ways, creating countless interesting “what if?” scenarios. What if Boudicca’s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066? In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill second edition. Game is punched and sorted into bags, but complete (other than missing one die). Box is in excellent shape: ever so slight wear from storage, but corners are all intact and not split. I am not the original owner, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how much play this saw; it certainly looks in good shape.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
