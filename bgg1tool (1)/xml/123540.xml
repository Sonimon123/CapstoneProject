   <description>In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;East sea road_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you'll have to be the most initiated traveler _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; which means that you'll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The potential action spaces in Tokaido are laid out on a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;East sea road_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to be the most initiated traveler - which means that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things.

 In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;East sea road_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to be the most initiated traveler - which means that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things. Through a unique zen mood, Tokaido is a strategic game while being extraordinarily peaceful and easy to learn.

    <notes>Passport Game Studios (PGSFNF001)
In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;East sea road_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to be the most initiated traveler - which means that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things. Through a unique zen mood, Tokaido is a strategic game while being extraordinarily peaceful and easy to learn.</notes>

    <notes>This auction is for the base game Tokaido, along with the Crossroads Expansion, as well as a set of four promo cards that as far as I know you only got by purchasing directly from the publisher at Gencon.
Everything is in excellent condition, except the box for the base game. One of the four corners is dented in. It was that way when I bought it.
Shipping will be $12 within the US. Feel free to email me with any questions. Thanks!</notes>
