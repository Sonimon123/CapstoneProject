   <description>Millennium Blades is a CCG-Simulator -- A game in which you play as a group of friends who play the fictional CCG _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Millennium Blades_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this game you will build decks, play the meta, acquire valuable collections, crack open random boosters, and compete in tournaments for prizes and fame. The game takes you from Starter Deck to Regionals in about 2-3 hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Multiple games can also be chained together to form a Campaign, going from Regionals to Nationals in game 2 and from Nationals to Worlds in game 3, with each game introducing ever more powerful cards and higher stakes, but also resetting the power of the game so that each player has a fair chance to win each 'season' of the campaign._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game draws heavily on Manga/Anime inspiration for its art, and parodies Magic: the Gathering, Yugioh, and many other collectible games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At its heart, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s a commodity trading game, except that instead of cubes or stocks, the things you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll be buying, selling, and speculating on are trading cards that can be used throughout the game in periodic tournaments. By trading wisely, playing the market, working together with friends, building collections, and winning tournaments, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll secure points and become the Millennium Blades World Champion._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game features a system of card pods, where you will play with about 400 of the base game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s 600 cards every game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>POWER GAMER PLEDGE REWARD - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to pay $80 and split the cost of shipping. Here are the specific details I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to agree to:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 1. Upon agreement I will pay $80 via PayPal in a BGG Marketplace transaction.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 2. When you receive the base game (first KS fulfillment), you send to me via whichever carrier you prefer (USPS, UPS, FedEx).
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 3. Upon my receipt of the base game/first KS fulfillment, I will send you the printed shipping cost directly via PayPal.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 4. When you receive the expansion materials (remaining KS fulfillment), you send to me via preferred carrier.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; It is my understanding that the base game is going to be heavier than the expansion, so at worst we will split shipping evenly and at best I will cover the majority of shipping.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for more than that, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not really interested. The research I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve done indicates that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be able to purchase virtually everything from the KS at retail for less than this offer would cost me. The main perk for you as the seller is that you get out almost entirely from the financial commitment of the KS. If you believe you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be able to recoup your investment under better terms, then I understand. If you want to table the offer for a bit and see what other offers might come through on BGG, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fine too. Please understand I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not trying to play hardball or be a jerk about it; my offer is commensurate with my interest in the game.</notes>

    <notes>LEVEL 99 GAMES (L99MB001)
Millennium Blades is a board game about a fictional collectible card game, which is also called Millennium Blades. You begin the game on pre-release night with just your starter deck. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll open new packs, form collections, and sell your junk cards on the aftermarket to buy hot new cards. Trade with your friends, build up your deck, and prepare to compete at Millennium Blades Worlds for the title of World Champion! This is a game about competitive deck building. You get a limited pool of cards, and then you tinker them into the most unfairly over-powered, table-flippingly broken deck that you can imagine. And your deck had better be pretty crazy, because your opponents won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be giving any quarter, and they all have unique collections with access to their own high-tier power cards. In addition to deckbuilding, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be speculating on blind pack buys, selling and buying cards on the aftermarket, and fusing your cards to make rarer and better ones to get an advantage over the competition. You might even make a few friends, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re willing to help them out.</notes>

    <notes>Due to us ordering a 3-pack to save on shipping for each of us, we have one spare copy of Millennium Blades!
Contains the following items:
- Kickstarter Edition of the base game (Includes Promo Pack 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2 and one signed playtest card)
- Art / Campaign Book 
- Set Rotation Expansion
(The Campaign Book and Set Rotation Expansion are due to arrive later this year).
 Shipping costs for the buyer, or pickup in Almere (The Netherlands).
Option to wait for the expansion and art book and have everything send at once, or to have the base game send now and the other items when they arrive (but this option will probably have more shipping costs in total).
 Shipped with DHL the rates are about:
8 Euro - Netherlands
22 Euro - West Europe (Belgium/Germany/Spain/Italy/Denmark/UK/France/Sweden/Portugal/Poland/Austria/etc.)
28 Euro - Rest of Europe (Greece/Bulgaria/Romania/Etc.)</notes>

    <notes>This is the retail version of the game, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including Promo Pack #1 and #2 and the signed prototype card from the Kickstarter campaign. The money has been assembled as neatly as I could manage, but some of the stickers are not perfectly aligned on the back (see photos). 5 of the 25 score sheets have been used. 
The game is complete and in very good condition. Pictured are some of the starting decks, the most used cards in the game, to give an idea of the condition of the cards overall.
The game is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3kg so UK postage will be £6.29 by Collect Plus. Enquire for prices to European countries.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter copy, which includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Thank You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; letter and signed card. Also included in base game box are : Promo Packs 1-2,  go7gaming licensed  insert, and FFG sleeves for all of the cards previously listed . 
Also includes sealed copies of Set Rotation and Promo Packs 3-5. 
Played twice, does not include original cardboard insert.  
This is VERY heavy, and not in a Marty McFly way.  Shipping is $37 in the US, international will be extremely expensive so please check prior to buying to avoid a misunderstanding.  
Local pickup in Lexington available, or Louisville/Cincy if patient.  For this game, I encourage it!
Please GM me with any questions, I will be happy to combine shipping on any item in my marketplace, OR with any item on my trade list if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to make an offer. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also discount t each item 10% on multiple purchase, I REALLY need the space!
All additional sales will go through BGG marketplace. Payment via paypal only</notes>

    <notes>Millennium Blades Kickstarter version with sealed Set Rotation expansion and all Kickstarter extras.  Also includes the Card Fusion, Final Bosses, and Futures mini expansions that were part of a separate Kickstarter (all sealed, never opened).  The base game cards are all sorted, organized, and in sleeves!  And I put those sleeved cards in cardboard boxes so everything is neat and fits in the based game. This is everything you can get for the game.  Just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time to play everything I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $10.00 (super heavy box). If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.</notes>

I purchased this second hand and, to be honest, I never realized the money was missing until I went to inventory it for sale. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen people post about missing money on new copies, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if this is the case here. 
Everything else is in excellent condition.

    <notes>This listing is for a Millennium Blades Collection.  Everything is the retail edition of the game and expansions.  Nothing has been played.   
Listing includes:
Base Game
Set Rotation (Slight ding in corner of box from shipping)
Deck Expansions 1-6 (new in shrink - Crossover Deck, Final Bosses Deck, Fusion Deck, Futures Deck, Sponsors Deck, Professionals Deck)
I will ship via USPS, UPS, or Fed Ex at my discretion.  The core game box is large and everything is heavy since it is all cards.  Because of this, shipping will be $28.</notes>
