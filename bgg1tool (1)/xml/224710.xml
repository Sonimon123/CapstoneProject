   <description>This sequel to the Zombicide: Black Plague will bring players back into a world of deadly medieval fantasy, this time filled with infected orcs and goblins who will put survivors to the ultimate test. This green menace is not only stronger than their human counterparts, but they also tend to gather into massive hordes that ambush the survivors when they least expect it._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Set in the same medieval era as Black Plague, players will take on the role of Survivors looking to defeat the shuffling, undead menace by any means possible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Green Horde, up to six players can join the battle for survival. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive. Fans of the Zombicide series have become familiar with the Walkers, Runners, Fatties, and Abominations that shuffle around, looking for victims. But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re zombie orcs! The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes. Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde. It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors. As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Enter the Horde!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses. Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead. Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Zombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face. With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully. Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on! Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This listing is for Zombicide Green Horde Kickstarter Edition -- New in Shrink.  Your purchase will include all KS stretch goals and exclusive content included in the Horde Pledge.  See the Kickstarter Campaign page for details: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/zombicide-green-horde
In addition to the KS Horde Pledge content, this purchase includes the following add-ons (NIS):
     -- Ultimate Survivors (KS Exclusive)
     -- DeadEye Walkers (originally, this expansion was part of the Black Plague campaign and integrates with either season)
This Kickstarter is being delivered to backers in 2 Waves....
WAVE 1     In hand as of April 25th and Ready to Ship.... includes the core box only.
WAVE 2     Will be shipped as soon as CMoN delivers and includes ALL the Green Horde stretch goals and exclusives. 
(As quoted by CMoN in Update #66: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Meanwhile, production of Wave 2 is wrapping up and pledges are starting to be packed. Everything remains on track for the estimated June delivery!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;)
You have two options for shipping:
OPTION 1:   The Green Horde can be shipped in two parts.  If you would like Wave 1, the core box, ASAP, I can ship upon purchase (shipping via USPS is $31.80). Then, WAVE 2 will be sent at an additional shipping charge when it arrives.
OPTION 2:   This will be the lower cost option and will combine shipment of Wave 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2.  They will ship as soon as Wave 2 is received from CMoN.
I purchased this game soon after getting into the hobby last summer and playing Zombicide Black Plague.  Since making this purchase, however, my gaming tastes have changed;  my wife and I both enjoy playing games that rely more heavily on strategy and less on luck.  So, I want to move this game along to a home where it will be truly loved, enjoyed, and played often.
Thanks for taking the time to check out this listing, and I hope you find what you are looking for!  Feel free to PM me if you have any additional questions.
Sincerely,
Bryan McInnis</notes>

    <notes>Hi all,
This is the Kickstarter Green Horde edition and comes with all the stretch goals, however, no expansions or anything like that. Please note, the price is a little bit cheaper then I think it is worth because I have thrown out the extra box and most of the inserts so it all fits in one box (the base box). This is because I did not intend to sell it originally. I am hoping someone would be interested regardless.
Everything is in great condition and the miniatures are very robust, so they are not going to be damaged in any way from just lying in the box.
If you do decide to order it, I will pack it pretty tight, and add some packing material inside the box to minimise movement in case you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re worried about wear and tear on the minis themselves.
I am happy to ship this anywhere, though would prefer an Australian buyer mostly because international shipping on this would likely be quite expensive.
For payment: paypal is great, and if in Australia, bank transfer is also a very useful alternative.
Thank you for your consideration.</notes>

    <notes>I backed this on Kickstarter. It arrived and I played it once - turned out to not be my thing.
This is the KS version (is it different from retail? not sure) of the base game, the Sean A. Murray Special Guest, and the Horde box (lots of other minis and a gigantic dragon).
As I played it once, clearly all the cardboard has been popped. But everything has been bagged up in my normal OCD manner. ;-)
$120 (or a good offer near that) + shipping. I live in Virginia, so if you happen to be local we can skip shipping and save a few bucks. Otherwise - this is 10 pounds of game, so the shipping will be somewhere around $16-20. Once we agree to the sale, I can pre-print the label and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll know the final price (which depends on your zip code).</notes>
