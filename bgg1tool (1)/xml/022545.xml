   <description>Designed by Glenn Drover, this boardgame allows you to revisit the age of exploration and discovery.  Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World.  As you proceed through three ages, you can launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capitol buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and, if necessary, declare war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Though originally published for 5 players, the game is playable by 6 with the original components and board configuration with addition of a set of figures in another color.  This was originally offered as an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and an incentive to pre-order the game. A 6 player expansion is also in the Glenn Drover's Empires: Builder Expansion, along with new capital buildings and National Advantage tiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Not to be confused with Age of Discovery._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>English edition.  The game has been played only once.  Complete with all components, which are organized in plastic bags and in excellent condition. The box has a small crease on the bottom.
Please see my eBay feedback if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like:  My username is gabeschw, and I currently have a feedback score of over 250 with 100% positive reviews. 
Shipping (to U.S. only) by Priority Mail will be about $9-15 (the game is pretty heavy, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll determine a fair amount in that range once I know the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s location). I greatly prefer Paypal, but will take a money order as well. </notes>

    <notes>QWG - Age of Empires III
Language: Dutch
2 to 5 players
10 year and older
Duration: 90 to 120 min
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,925 kg
Theme: A brand new game from Glenn Drover, the designer of hits like Railroad Tycoon and Age of Mythology. This based on the popular Age of Empires III video game, but in adapting it to the tabletop, Drover put playability first in stead of trying to slavishly follow the video game. The result is his best design yet, and has been hailed by insiders as the best game of the year! In the tradition of Eagle Games, this game boasts a large, beautiful map and 250 detailed plastic miniatures.

    <notes>This is for the Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery edition.
This game has been played twice. The components show no signs of wear. The box has some shelf wear.
This game is usually around $45 on CSI / BnB, but is currently out of print.
Contact me with your zipcode to get an accurate shipping estimate. Unless you give a preference, I will ship whichever of USPS, UPS, or FedEx is cheapest with delivery confirmation. I will gladly combine shipping for multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>Hi there!  While I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d really like to call the condition _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, there are two reasons I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t.  One, the shrinkwrap has been removed.  And second, the top left and the bottom right corners are the box are a little banged up.  However, all of the contents are still in their original packaging and have never been opened.  So its hard to know what exactly to call it.  
Anyway, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $30 for this game.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere within the US for $10</notes>

    <notes>Punched but unplayed, perfect condition except minor shelf wear.  Player pieces stored in colored baggies and common pieces stored in a nice Plano box (see picture).  Whatever insert that was in the box has been removed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me before purchasing if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Description:
It is the late 15th century and a new age is dawning. While searching for a new trade route to India, explorers have discovered a new land. The first reports tell of strange creatures, exotic people, and fabulous wealth. Captains and dventurers flock to these new lands in search of gold. They are quickly followed by colonists, soldiers, merchants, and missionaries all seeking wealth of one kind or another. Colonies begin to spring up, and soon competition among the great nations of Europe begins.
Take the role of one of Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s colonial powers and stake your claim in the New World. As the leader of your nation, there are many paths that lead to victory: Discover and colonize new lands; acquire trade goods that will build your economy; develop new technologies and infrastructure in your home country; build your merchant fleet to dominate the trade routes; and build your army to defend what is rightfully yours!
The triumphant revel in riches and glory, while the vanquished become a footnote in the history books. It is an Age of Discovery... it is an Age of Empires!
    * Explore the New World, discovering and claiming new lands for your empire
    * Gather resources to develop your economic infrastructure
    * Build structures that give you advantages in resources or victory points
    * Use specialists to give you the strategic advantage over your opponents
    * Go to war to defend what is yours or take what is not
    * Euro-style game design by Glenn Drover
Components:
•250 Plastic Miniatures and Coins

As you can see, the box has some significant wear (received un-punched un-played like this). I also laid down duct tape on the inside bottom of the box just to add to stability. The box AoE III was published with is simply not very thick or high quality.
 But the components (not extensively pictured) are essentially like new. 
The Discovery tiles have small color coded stickers (pictured) giving the strength of the native colonies a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;threat level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; purple _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; orange, easy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; medium _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; hard) as discussed here: 
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/205115/maybe-another-way-handle-failed-discoveries
These should be easily removed, but I hesitate to do so since I honestly think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the best way to play the game and recommend it (leave it up to buyer).
SHIPPING:
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big box with a ton of plastic minis. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how much shipping will be. But let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s say that I cap it at $15 for the buyer so that if it goes over that amount I will cover the rest. If it ends up shipping for less, I will charge less for shipping.</notes>

Tropical Games edition. I have played this a couple times. It is an awesome game. It is one of the few games that got me into this hobby. You may think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m getting rid of this because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m getting the upcoming KS copy. Well, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just time to let it go.
All the components are in excellent shape. The instruction manual has a diagonal crease on all the pages. It came like that during shipping. The box has minor dishing, but looks great for being flimsy cardboard. 
Also comes with two other items:
1) The Plague Promo tiles, still unpunched
2) Empires: Builder Expansion-- all the components, never used. Cardboard unpunched. If you want the box, I still have it.
This sale has been auto-generated for the auction: [geekurl=/geeklist/188174/item/3787850#3787850]Item for Geeklist _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m done with these games...and getting rid of them.

    <notes>This copy of the game has been played only once.  All game components are present (all plastic figures, all tiles, plastic money, cards, rules and board).  All components are in pretty great shape except for the rules.  The rules have definitely been looked through.
I did purchase the sixth player black pieces for the game and they are in the box.
The plastic figures have no major damage after all of these years.  However, the crosses on the top of the pole for the Missionaries have been bent in some cases.  Pretty much the same as when they arrived.
The game box is also in pretty decent shape after almost 8 years.  There is damage to the game box top.  Near the right side of the game box top, there is a concave arc from one corner to the other.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only 1/64 of an inch concave, but it is visible when you look at the box.  That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how it arrived when I bought it all those years ago.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.
I can also add the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Glenn Drover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Empires: The Age of Discovery – Plague Promo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to the purchase.  Please send GeekMail regarding the promo.</notes>

    <notes>There is some box wear, but everything is verified complete and in very good condition. There is no insert if there ever was one. I absolutely love this game, but a two hour worker placement game is a tough sell with my gaming group so it goes largely unplayed. Shelf space is at a premium so I feel compelled to part with this one if I can get a fair price.</notes>

============
Hi,
You won a game (or more) from me or my buddy in the auction geeklist.
Here are some details to handover my game in Essen.
We will arrive Thursday around 1PM so I would avoid to swap games as we will travel early.
So here are the best options to meet us :
* You work during Essen in a booth ou you can have a deposit point in a booth, let me know as we will travel all around the halls during 4 days
* I will be present on Friday AND Saturday at 12.00 at the global Math Trade meeting point. I will stay in one place and my minions will chase after buyers.
For newbies and even experimented, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the new meeting point for Math Trade : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/3199021/etherion?size=original
* I will stay on Bredeney Hotel, it can also be a meeting point at breakfast or after show hours
* Last but not least, my friends will have their own booth (Serious Poulp - 7-F121) but as thy are doing their own businness, I would avoid to disturb them!
So please give me your details, your preferred method and the day you want to have my game.
Here are my details, I will have Internet _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; phone available in Germany.
Email : yoann.terradura@gmail.com
Mobile : +336.50.30.41.72
Take care and see you in Essen !
Yoann

    <notes>NOTE: This price includes the expansion -- [b][thing=41261][/thing][/b]
Condition: The box has been a notorious problem. The top has a crease and wear on the corners. The bottom tore in a corner. I taped it up so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fundamentally sound. It holds! The rulebook is clearly creased from much referencing. 
The components are otherwise in very good shape.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

Played many times. The game itself is in very good condition but the box lid is caved and the corners are worn. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling the Builders Expansion here https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1437120 for $20. If you want both the base game and expansion, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll drop the price to $50.
Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from U.S.A.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>
