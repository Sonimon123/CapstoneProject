   <description>In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    War of the Ring Collector's Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    War of the Ring (Second Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Upgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bother with a picture since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s new.  Contact me if you want to see a picture of it.
Unfortunately this beastie wont fit in a USPS flat rate box, but I only ask for actual shipping.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing $11  in the USA but I will refund any excess shipping.  Better yet, come by and pick it up!

    <notes>This game was opened and NEVER PLAYED. My friends did not want to learn all the rules so I have opted for simpler games since. This game is in PERFECT CONDITION, with no nicks or scratches whatsoever.
Shipping will UPS Ground Service and will be coming from Florida, USA. Shipping costs will be calculated based on the buyers location after the sale.
Thanks!

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE. 
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address. 
Payment Notes:
US buyers: 
USPS money order is preferred. 
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card. 
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price). 
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 30 cents higher. </notes>

    <notes>This is a very well cared for copy of Fantasy Flight Games War of the Ring with several upgrades!
Twilight of the Third Age expansion included!  All of the base game expansion components from the “Battles of the Third Age” expansion box are included, so you get the full, expanded War of the Ring experience.  Does not include any components from that box specific to the “Battles of the War of the Ring” stand-alone game, but this does not at all affect playing of War of the Ring.
Colored and detailed figures!  The one problem with this game as it comes is that all the good guy army figures are all blue and all the bad guy figures are red.  However, during the game it is important to distinguish which faction each figure belongs to.  This can be difficult when all your figures are the same color!  To remedy this, I spent considerable time detailing the figure bases with paint markers or metallic markers to make them match the color of their nation borders.  I also added a variable amount of detailing to the figures to spruce them up (see photos).  This makes the game MUCH easier and enjoyable to play.
Sleeved cards!  All game cards are protected by form fitting sleeves to keep them in pristine shape through many plays.
This is a great game in excellent condition that I’ve put a lot of my time into.  I’d love to see it find a good home!

I rated the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because there is an extra miniature, but another faction is short by one.  I plan to contact fantasy flight to get a replacement.  The game is very playable even with this minor issue.

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>This is the first edition of War of the Ring (engl.) and the copy has seen very few plays. The cards are in good shape and any warped figures (such as some of the Nazguls) had been replaced early on by original replacements from the distributor. Figures are unpainted.
The item is located near Zurich, Switzerland. Orders from within the EU will be shipped from Germany (to avoid custom fees). Orders to Switzerland can be either picked up or shipped domestically.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling this game with painted figures: http://www.marktplaats.nl/a/hobby-en-vrije-tijd/gezelschapsspellen-bordspellen/m991659632-war-of-the-rings-met-beschilderde-figuren.html?c=efb2ef4dc323389c4f92ed10afa33e3a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;previousPage=lr
the top box is sightly damaged due to a cat went crazy but that is not why you want this box. Its because of the painted figures! Just so good looking. Every race has its own pallet of colors. No more those pesky blue and red races.
Buyers from The Netherlands are favored because of easy of payment/shipping. 
pm me or drop me an mail.
Cheers,
R.</notes>

    <notes>Condition: Game pieces, including cards, dice, and figures are in excellent, like-new condition.  Game board has been split along one seam so that there are three board pieces.  Box has shelf wear and a taped corner. 
This game is missing the following components:
Instruction books and player aid files
A red dice
Witch King character card
5 pieces: 1 Hammer Dwarve, 1 Elven Bowman, 1 Blue Regular Bowman, 1 Urukai, 1 Red Regular Bowman
Counters: Gimli Character Counter, Free Peoples_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Leading Character Token, 1 Settlement Control Token, 5 Army unit replacement tokens.
I believe this game is playable as is (with some help from the files section on BGG for rules), so it would be good for somebody wanting to try it but not wanting to spend much.  It would also be good for somebody wanting extra pieces to supplement their existing set.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English. FFG
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

Game has been swet up a handful of times but never been played. I have replaced the tiny cards from the original game with larger, upgraded cards that were available later via upgrade kit. The condition of all components including the box is very good.
The game is heavy, so please expect higher shipping costs.

    <notes>This copy is complete. One large square counter fell out of the counter sheet.
Inserted back into the counter sheet for the picture.
All dice, game cards and plastic figures are still sealed inside the plastic bags, never opened.
All game contents are excellent, crisp, clean, unused condition. The rule book had two pages stuck 
together, had to separate them, left a tiny pull mark, less than a dime in size. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t touch
any text. Otherwise, game components are in the same condition as when box was opened.
Only examined a couple of times. Rules never read, Boards only opened twice.</notes>
