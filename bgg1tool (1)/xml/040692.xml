   <description>In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;into decline_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depend on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Days of Wonder - Small World
Language: Dutch
2 to 5 players
8 year and older
Duration: about 40 to 80 min
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,930 kg
Theme: In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all. Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci™, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs and even humans; who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth. Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!

    <notes>This item for sale isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just Small World.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Small World and all of the SW expansions (including Leaders, but not Tunnels.)
The Small World base game has been played twice.  All components are punched and in the provided game trays.  All blank race and power tokens are still present.  Even though the game has been played twice, all components are still in excellent condition.  I believe I have only used the 4-5 player map.
All game contents have been verified.  That took a while, but they are all present.
Outside game box is in very good condition.  There are the beginning signs of wear and tear on the game box.  If you look closely, you see a dent or a small scratch here and there.  The box has been carried around for 2+ years.  Luckily, they are not noticeable unless you look closely.
The two game trays are in intact and still used.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including most of the current Small World expansions with the base game.
Small World: Grand Dames of Small World:
The race and power tokens have been added to the base game for one play.  Still in excellent condition.  Currently housed in the tray provided by Be Not Afraid ...
Small World: Cursed!:
The race and power tokens have been added to the base game for one play.  Still in excellent condition.  Currently housed in the tray provided by Be Not Afraid ...
Leaders of Small World:
This expansion has never been played.  The tokens have been punched out and are currently housed in the tray provided by Be Not Afraid ...
Small World: Be Not Afraid...:
This expansion has never been played.  The components have been punched out and are in the tray provided with this expansion.
Small World: Necromancer Island:
This expansion has never been played.  The components have been punched out and are currently housed in both the tray provided by Be Not Afraid ... and in the base game.  The Well of Souls and Necromancer Island are in the base game.
Small World: Tales and Legends:
This expansion has been played, but only the eight cards with the SW icon were used (in addition to the two required Current/Future cards).  All cards have been accounted for.
All of the expansion rules are in the base game box.
Small World and expansions comes from non-smoking house.

    <notes>This comes with the Be Not Afraid, Grand Dames of Smallworld, Cursed!, and Necromancer Island expansions, hence the higher price tag.
In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.
Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.
Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!</notes>

    <notes>Gently used.  The box and all the pieces are in very nice condition.
I took a full inventory and discovered that one of the victory coins has gone missing, but the game comes with tons of them so it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really matter.  Also, the blank _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;make up your own race_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card has been used.  Again, zero effect on your ability to play and enjoy the game.
Shipping in the US is only $8.00.  Shipping elsewhere will be more.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the Boston area.  Local trade or pickup is swell.</notes>

The games were barely played (some of the expansions were never played) and everything is in perfect condition.  The pieces are sorted and bagged.  
Shipping and handling is $10.</notes>

Have played this perhaps 3 times, as such everything is in excellent condition.
Would list as brand new expect its out of shrink and everything has been punched.

    <notes>Includes the base game, Grand Dames, Be Not Afraid, Tales and Legends (in shrink) and Cursed all in one box for one price.
Played a few times but in pristine condition.  Does not include original insert, but does include the original and expansion token trays for all races.  Everything fits nicely into the original box (see picture).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>My copy does not have the insert that holds all of the pieces.  It does, however, have the tray and cover that hold all the race tokens.  I also had to repair two of the inner box corners.  I used glue for one corner and glue and a paper bracket for the other.  The repairs were neatly done.  Other than that, everything is bagged up and in excellent shape.  Feel free to ask any questions or ask for a shipping estimate.</notes>

Played with care a handful of times. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the original owner so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in great condition.
It includes
Small World: Be Not Afraid...
Small World: Cursed!
Which have been used only once or twice
and
Small World: Tales and Legends
which I opened to read but never played.

    <notes>The game is in wonderful condition, played about 10 times in a smoke-free environment.  Will include Cursed! expansion with it (as I currently no longer have the expansions original packaging and no place to store it should I sell the game) for FREE!
I will ship either USPS or UPS depending on whatever method is preferred.  Shipping from zip code 29072.  I saw another sale saying that shipping via USPS should be no more than about $12.  
Shipping will happen after payment is received (and shipping costs determined).  I do have other items for sale if you happen to find others to buy, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship them together to save on shipping costs.</notes>

Small World
Be Not Afraid...
Cursed!
Necromancer Island
Tales and Legends
Leaders of Small World
Grand Dames of Small World
Buying these from CoolStuffInc with their discount would still cost close to $100.00 (some stuff is OOP though)
Components are neatly bagged and organized. Pimped container for races with pull-tabs for pulling out the races during the game. Extra draw bags included for randomizing races.
Everything fits in base box though I do have expansion boxes too.

    <notes>Game is in good condition, complete with cards and chits. Played a handful of times so has some light wear. The insert came with a minor tear in one corner of the plastic, however this does not affect the use of it.
Paypal payment only.
I will ship using 3-5 day courier due to the size of the game and combine for multiple purchases. This will most likely be Hermes which will cost £4, however if you would prefer an alternative please let me know. If you are outside of the UK postal region, please contact me with your location and I will get a postage quote for you.</notes>

I listed this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but in reality everything is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; except for some very slight wear on the Small World Box. Everything comes in three boxes--the box for Small World, Small World Underground, and Small World Realms. The insert for Small World underground is not included in order to make room for all the expansion components.
Shipping is $13. See my other listings and ask about combining multiple orders to save on shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Box has some edge wear. Components are like new.
Includes the following expansions:
Cursed!
Grand Dames of Small World
Be Not Afraid...
Necromancer Island
Tales and Legends
Leaders of Small World
The only expansion box I have is Tales and Legends. I have stored most of the contents in the base box which still has the original insert. Tales and Legends is separate along with some of the game tiles which are stored separately in an original Small World covered tray.
Buyer pays shipping. I recommend asking for a shipping estimate before buying, but that is up to you. I will combine shipping for multiple orders, so check out my other items I have for sale to save money on shipping. I accept payment through Paypal or Dwolla. Payment is expected within 24 hours of receipt of final bill including shipping.</notes>

Please do not purchase if you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t win this auction.
- Games are shipped via USPS Priority Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise, at which point we can discuss shipping. 
- I exclusively use PayPal and PayPal invoices. Please do not pay me until I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sent you an invoice. 
This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail. </notes>

    <notes>Versand innerhalb Deutschlands als DHL-Paket ist 5,99 €
Versand außerhalb Deutschlands ist grundsätzlich auch möglich, allerdings lohnt sich das bei den derzeitigen Versandpreisen eigentlich nicht. Ihr könnt mich aber gerne anschreiben, wenn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trotzdem sein soll.
---------------------
Shipping within Germany is 5,99€
Generally speaking, shipping outside of Germany is also possible, yet not really practical due to the high shipping costs these days. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d still like to have this shipped internationally, just contact me and I can provide the shipping cost for your destination.</notes>

Everything like new. The base game has only been played a couple of times. The expansions and Underground have never been played. 
In order to get the expansions to fit in the box, I threw away the insert from the base game, stored the boards in the Underground box, and stored loose bits like the point tokens in small plastic containers. Neither the base game or Underground boxes have any major issues.
