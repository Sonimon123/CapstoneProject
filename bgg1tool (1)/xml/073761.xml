   <description>K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth as well as the second deadliest. It's known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.   _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You know the dangers of K2 all too well. Extreme weather with frequent and  deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hi. Thanks for looking. We purchases this new and have played it only twice. I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get my family interested at all, so it seems silly to keep it only as a solitaire game. All components and the box are in practically new condition. Please let me know if you would like photographs or if you have additional questions. Kindly, Eric</notes>

K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth as well as the second deadliest. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit... And K2 has never been climbed in winter. Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory. You know the dangers of K2 all too well. Extreme weather with frequent and deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves. K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers. </notes>

    <notes>This game has only been played twice.  The box, board, and components are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.  However, I did cut the insert a little to make room for a small plastic container to put all the different player pieces in.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included the plastic container in the game.  Also included is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Avalanche_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion.  Please add $10 for shipping.</notes>

K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth as well as the second deadliest. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit... And K2 has never been climbed in winter. Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory. You know the dangers of K2 all too well. Extreme weather with frequent and deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves. K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.</notes>

    <notes>COMPONENTS PERFECT BUT BOX _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; INSERT DAMAGED - SEE PICTURES!
2nd edition from Common Man Games
Game components are in excellent shape and the game has been verified as complete including the original instructions. Box is pretty badly damaged on one corner/side (see pictures #3 -  #7). It has been taped up to reinforce the corner. As you can see in the pictures, the insert is also damaged. The rulebook does have a little wear at a corner or two but all actual game components were unharmed. Cards are all in excellent shape. Box closes just fine and serves its purpose, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not a box for collectors!</notes>

K2
[b]Version[/b]: Common Man Second edition (2011) 
[b]Condition[/b]: Very Good
[b]Description[/b]: The cards are in excellent condition with no visible wear or tear and no bending. All the pieces are accounted for. One 0-value risk token is peeling away from its backing. You can definitely tell which one it is in the pile, but I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game-breaking. A little glue would probably fix it. The box has minimal scuffing.</notes>

Canada: between $20-30, depending on the weight and how far you are from BC.
US: more than $30, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re probably better off buying the game from a local supplier
