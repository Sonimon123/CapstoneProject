   <description>Each player represents the leadership of a 17th century Scottish clan looking to expand its territory and its wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the correct decision at the opportune time, be it by establishing a new pasture for your livestock, growing grain for the production of whisky, selling your goods on the various markets, or investing in the cultivation of special places such as lochs and castles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Glen More offers a unique turn mechanism. Players take territory tiles from a rondel. Picking a tile has not only influence on the actions you get by the surrounding tiles in your territory, it also determines when you'll have your next turn (and how many turns you will have in the game). But having a lot of turns is not always the best strategy for a successful chieftain._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Glen More is 6 in the Alea medium box series, and is rated a 4 on the alea complexity level._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>New in original shrinkwrap.  German edition, but the game is mostly language independent.  Has a crease along the top cover, bottom edge of the box.
If you purchase multiple games from me, I will be happy to combine the games together in one box to help you save on shipping costs.
Local pickup is available around Los Angeles, CA.

    <notes>Game has been played three times, treated well, box and pieces all in excellent condition.
 
Will ship from 04011, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a smaller box so my guess is $7 shipping in northeast U.S., $10 to west coast.  Feel free to ask for a shipping quote (I usually use USPS).
 
Local pickup in Mid-Coast Maine is welcome.

All games are new and in their original wrapping and all prices include the German VAT (7% or 19%).
We offer only goods that we have in stock.
We ship worldwide – please ask for a quote about exact shipping costs (rest assured that we always try to keep them as low as possible).
Payment may be made by Paypal or bank transfer in advance.
For orders above €50 we grant a discount of €5 on shipping costs.
If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email (laden@gamers-hq.de), give us a call (+49 30 79706126) or visit our homepage (www.gamers-hq.de).
Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

4. Zahlungsbedingungen 
Wir bieten standartmäßig 3 Möglichkeiten der Bezahlung an:
Per Bankeinzug, Vorkasse oder  per PayPal .Nach der dritten Bestellung räumen wir unseren Kunden auch die Möglichkeit des Kaufs auf Rechnung ein, wir sind jedoch befugt, diese Möglichkeit bei mehrmaligem Zahlungsverzug auch wieder zu widerrufen.
5. Rückgaberecht 
Sie können ohne Angabe von Gründen durch Erklärung per Fax, E-Mail oder einfaches Briefschreiben oder durch Rücksendung unserer Waren eine Bestellung widerrufen. Für die Absendung der Widerrufserklärung oder unserer Waren ist eine Widerrufsfrist von zwei Wochen einzuhalten, die mit Eingang unserer Lieferung bei Ihnen beginnt.
Ein Widerrufsrecht steht Ihnen - auch innerhalb der Widerrufsfrist - in keinem Fall bei folgenden Waren zu:
- Audio- oder Videoaufzeichnungen bzw. Software, wenn Sie die entsprechenden Datenträger entsiegelt haben, 
- Zeitungen, Zeitschriften und Illustrierten. 
Unsere Ware ist sofort nach der fristgerechten Ausübung des Widerrufsrechts auf unsere Kosten und Gefahr an uns zurückzusenden, wenn der Widerruf nicht bereits durch Rücksendung ausgeübt wurde.

Ausnahmsweise sind die Kosten der Rücksendung von Ihnen zu tragen, wenn der Rechnungswert unserer Ware nicht mehr als Euro 20,00 beträgt. In keinem Fall haben Sie die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, wenn die von uns gelieferte Ware nicht der bestellten Ware entspricht.
Sollten Sie bereits den Kaufpreis für die Ware bezahlt haben, werden wir diesen nach einem Widerruf unverzüglich zurückerstatten. Wenn Sie unsere Ware nach dem Widerruf ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurücksenden, sind Sie uns gesetzlich zu Wertersatz verpflichtet. Das gilt nicht, soweit Sie unsere Ware lediglich so geprüft haben, wie Sie es z.B. im Ladengeschäft hätten tun können. Jede darüber hinausgehende Nutzung der Ware berechtigt uns jedoch zu Ersatzansprüchen, die unter Umständen die Höhe des Kaufpreises erreichen können. Sollten Sie also einen Widerruf in Betracht ziehen, beschränken Sie sich möglichst auf eine optische Prüfung und nehmen Sie die Ware nicht regulär in Gebrauch.

* Material condition of this copy is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but the game is being classified as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because 1 of the 58 victory point tokens is missing (57/58 are present).   This does not impact game play and the game is otherwise 100% complete.  See pictures below.

English edition. Never played with. Cardboard is unpunched. Contents look fantastic. Only minor quibble is that box top shows a little dishing, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look bad.
Also in this listing is the game Condottiere, per conditions and terms from my auction.

    <notes>Box top has some whitening and a slightly crushed corner.  Box bottom has a dent about an inch from one corner (came that way when I bought it from FLGS a few years ago) and damage to that corner and some creasing like a smaller box got shoved into it during shipping.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not pristine, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not an eyesore either; see attached pictures.
The game has been played several times but all components are present and in very good condition.  Listed as Good simply because the box has more than normal shelf wear.
Also includes a few laminated play aids (rule summary and tile summary).</notes>

    <notes>Game is actually in *like new* condition with the exception of the generic Alea plastic insert being discarded.  A small Plano box works better anyway (not included).  All other parts are accounted for and have been punched out and bagged in separate ziplock baggies.  Only played a few times.  We take very good care of the few games we own.

    <notes>Version - English Rio Grande Games
Condition - New in shrink-wrap. Small tear in shrink-wrap in lower back side.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a small size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>New-in-shrink.  I have been the only owner of this game.  The game comes from a smoke-free home.
While the game is still in the shrink wrap, sadly it was slightly damaged in transit.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a crease that cuts across the top-right quadrant of the front of the box to the top.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also a small tear along the crease.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included a couple of pictures of the box below.  Please let me know if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to see more pictures.

    <notes>Brand new, factory sealed in shrink!
Box condition is mint! I will carefully pack to ship.
The Ravensburger German edition is not a problem for English speakers. This game is mostly language independent. Besides tile names of which have art on the tile that clearly depict what it is (i.e. forests,  pastures, taverns, etc) the only thing that is in German are castle bonuses, but icons are used there too and a one-page rule sheet printed from files section with the castles makes it like the English edition. Also, I personally enjoy Ravensburger game printing quality. 
Sweeeet sheep! This is such a great game, enjoy! :D</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for a copy of Glen More by Rio Grande Games.  Game is in very good condition, and has been punched but is unplayed.  There is a very light crease on the left side of the box lid.
Buyer pays $13.65 for USPS Priority Mail shipping, or, if combined with other games, actual shipping via USPS Priority from zip code 46143.  This game can easily be combined with 1-2 others of similar size in a USPS medium flat rate box.  Please contact me for more information if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in combining shipping.
I only accept PayPal and only ship to the US.</notes>

    <notes>1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>
