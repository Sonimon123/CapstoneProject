   <description>GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: In turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;GIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF. It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the game GIPF itself._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is part of project GIPF._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition.  It has been played several times, but the box shows no wear.  I am selling my entire collection of Gipf so if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, please look in the other Gipf games for the entire collection minus Yinsh.
All games are in excellent condition being in slightly played status.  If you have any questions feel free to ask!

Components:  Complete and in like new condition!  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.

    <notes>Smart Games - GIPF
Language: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Spanish 
Players: 2
Age: 9+
Duration: about 30 min 
Weight: 0.850 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.

This will be shipped with the Torres purchase, but may be split into two shipments going out at the same time to protect the games from being mishandled by the shipping co. due to the combined weight and size of the box it would take to ship everything in.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to charge $25 for S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H, but it might go over that.  If so, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll eat the costs.  If it ends up costing less, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund the difference unless asked not to.
Please send payment via Paypal to: 
themuppetpastor@gmail.com
Other forms are acceptable, but using paypal will get you your games quicker as I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to wait not just for the payment, but for it to clear, yada yada yada...
Games will be shipped within 48 hours of the payment being received.
Thanks,
Brian

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO134)
Gipf is a deceptively simple abstract game that will challenge you and your friends. Add pieces to the board by moving them from the edge. Create rows of four to capture your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pieces and win the game!</notes>

==============================================
The games I am selling come from my personal collection. I often have bought games used or traded for them. I will do my best to accurately describe their condition. I 
will confirm completeness in most cases (unless stated otherwise) but not for items that come in large quantities for which a few missing will make no difference (like 
stacks of paper money for example). Please note that I am not concerned about inserts and may have removed them from a game that I felt didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them. I might not 
think to mention that in the description. If you are interested in the insert, please ask.
Note that our home is smoke-free but not pet-free. I can not guarantee the complete absence of cat hair in the boxes
I prefer to ship via USPS Priority. I use non-Flat Rate boxes unless it will save you money for me to use Flat Rate boxes. I buy the postage on-line and charge the 
exact cost to the buyer. I am happy to combine multiple items to save you on shipping
I have perfect feedback here on BGG. On ebay, where I am selling my record collection, I am ronattic, and have 100% positive feedback. So please buy with confidence.</notes>
