   <description>Mint Works is a light and straightforward worker placement game. Its compact size makes it easy to put in your pocket and take it anywhere. Its simple rules make it easy to introduce new players to the genre of worker placement._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During the game each player will have a limited amount of Mint Tokens, which represent their workers. Players will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans. Plans are how players earn points. Some plans will give only points, others will give extra powers to the owner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once any player has at least 7 points earned (or if there are not enough plans to refill the stock) the end of the game is triggered. The game will then be over at the end of the current round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Whoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Played twice. Everything looks new. I trimmed the corners of the rulebook and reference sheet, so that they would fit into the tin nicely (Tom Vasel mentioned this practice in his video review of Mint Works). The way they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re packed in the tin, the corners of the rulebook and reference sheet are always dog-eared when you open a new copy of Mint Works. Because of this technicality (trimming the corners of the rulebook and reference sheet), I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing the game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;</notes>

Game Contents:
  Ⓜ️ Rules
  Ⓜ️ Starting Player Token
  Ⓜ️ Player Aid
  Ⓜ️ 30 Mint Tokens
  Ⓜ️ 33 Cards:
       Ⓜ️ 10 Location Cards
       Ⓜ️ 21 Plan Cards
       Ⓜ️ 2 AI Cards (for solo play)
Mint Works is a light and straightforward worker placement game. Its compact size makes it easy to put in your pocket and take it anywhere. Its simple rules make it easy to introduce new players to the genre of worker placement.
During the game each player will have a limited amount of Mint Tokens, which represent their workers. Players will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans. Plans are how players earn points. Some plans will give only points, others will give extra powers to the owner.
Once any player has at least 7 points earned (or if there are not enough plans to refill the stock) the end of the game is triggered. The game will then be over at the end of the current round.
Whoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins!
We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re glad to back campaigns to bring you games like Mint Works to buy online at TheGameSteward. We will use a hefty percentage of every dollar you spend on Mint Works towards backing fantastic new games on Kickstarter! Just a reminder, if you have purchase questions on Mint Works game, how to buy online at The Game Steward or just need a game advice, please contact us at The Game Steward.</notes>
