   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Attention all Marines! All UAC personnel be advised. There has been a code red security breach in the dimensional gateway research facility here at the Union Aerospace Corporation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Mars base. We are under invasion. I repeat, we are under invasion._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Report immediately to central command. If you are isolated from the main facility, seek out other marines, form squads, and engage the invaders with whatever means possible. The weapons at the Mars base are limited, but should be sufficient for neutralizing the invaders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Doom: The Boardgame, demonic invaders have broken through from another dimension into the Union Aerospace Corporation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Mars base. Marines have been deployed to the base to protect UAC personnel and destroy the invaders. Up to three players will take the roles of heavily armed and highly trained marines, while one player will control the legion of demonic invaders. In the game, the marine players explore the claustrophobic rooms and corridors of the Mars base, attacking monsters, picking up new weapons and equipment, and working together to complete specific mission objectives._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The heart of Doom: The Boardgame is the scenario. Before every game, a scenario must be chosen. Each individual scenario will tell you how to set up the game, explain any special rules, and describe the specific objectives you must achieve in order to win the game. You will find several ready-to-play scenarios in the Doom Scenario Guide._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Doom: The Boardgame is a game for 2 to 4 players Ages 12 and up, playable in 1 to 2 hours, based on the groundbreaking DOOM computer game by id Software._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Doom: The Boardgame Expansion Set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hello.
I am selling my copy of Doom: The Boardgame due to lack of people to play is with. This is unfortunate as it is a great game and I have had a blast the two times that I have managed to get people together.
Item is brand new, opened and used two times. Everything is in mint condition. I have taken great care of this item, always carefully stored after use.</notes>

I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do a good job of organizing the pieces so they are pretty much all scattered inside the boxes.  All pieces should be there (there are a lot of pieces) but if you are unsatisfied, money back guaranteed, just pay shipping.

    <notes>I have a used copy of the base game and expansion. It is missing a few minis and I am not sure about the chits, but most of them look to be there. I received this used and jumbled together so did my best to sort out.
Some of the map pieces are a bit beat up but most of the contents is in good shape. Would be happy to pass both along to someone for cheap as long as you help with shipping since this is a large/heavy game!
I would bundle both together, just listing both here as one item though. Thanks!

    <notes>Doom (2004) by Fantasy Flight
Box:  Light shelfwear with a few minor dings, dents, or creases.  In particular, there is a paper tear about 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long on one corner (but the cardboard is not split).  Overall the box is in excellent condition! 
Components:  Complete!  The bases on the three Marines have been painted white, and some of the terrain tiles show wear around the connectors.  All other pieces are in like new condition!  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 7 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.

Sadly, this was played only a couple of times. My group was more interested in Descent.
Everything from base and expansion neatly organized in plano container and baggies.

    <notes>Good condition overall.  Box was dropped so it has 2 dented corners (1 medium, 1 small) and 1 split corner.  The box also has a bit of shelf wear and some dishing from being stored ontop of a smaller box.  The 4 reference sheets have some bends.  Some map tiles have slight damage on the puzzle-like edges.  Complete as far as I can tell.  The only thing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure about is that the component list calls for 15 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tokens... I have 6 extra wound tokens, 3 purple cross tokens, 3 berserk tokens, and 3 tokens depicting a doom card with an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; through it... which adds up to 15.  EXTRA: I will include a clear, plastic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Plano-like_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; storage box to keep the chits organized.</notes>

    <notes>This game is complete with all components present.  The reason I have the condition listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is because the box lid has significant damage (split corners that have been duck-taped and general denting and scraping).  The box itself is also somewhat damaged though less-so than the lid.  
The components are as I said all present and all in very nice shape.  The only exception are the die-faces which have worn off.  However they have been replaced with the official new print-out faces from Fantasy Flight Games.  All other components are in nice shape.
Buyer to pay only the actual shipping, if you have questions or would like to see pictures please let me know.  2% discount if you pay with Check.</notes>

    <notes>2004 Fantasy Flight.  Played, believed to be complete.  All the major pieces (rules, figures, map pieces) match the rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s content list.  The other pieces match is most cases, but there is evidence in the BGG forum that this list was not 100% accurate.  
The box has been heavily taped along a couple of the lid edges.  Everything inside the box is in very good condition.</notes>

    <notes>This game was opened and played only once. It is a fun game, but I could never get anyone from my group interested in playing it again which is why I am selling it. There is mininal shelf wear on the corners of the box.I have verified that all the contents are intact and in great condition (see picture).Please note that two of the Mancubus figures have slightly bent bases (i.e. their bases curve upward slightly) but they were like that when I bought the game and they stand upright just fine. I will pay the shipping costs and will ship out once the payment is confirmed on paypal. Thank you for checking out my listing.</notes>

All my items I sell are either New in Shrink, or Like New. I take care of my games period, that includes inside and out. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m OCD about it. If for some reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a game that isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t New or Like New it will be noted.

The set has been opened from their shrinks, but inside the box the bags and all components are still sealed and unpunched. The boxes are in perfect condition with no signs of wear or rips. They are truly in mint condition minus the shrink wrap.
Shipping is included.
Thanks for looking!

    <notes>I am selling this for a friend. There may be some hours delay in response to messages about this item if i need to ask a question I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the answer for.
The game is in good to very good condition inside the box, but the box itself has suffered a bit over the years. It looks dusty and the lid has dished. There is corner wear from sitting on the shelf for so long and one corner obviously took a ding in the post and has some squash damage. Photos can be supplied on request and you give me an email address or mobile number to send them too. The minis and cardboard pieces inside look in good to very good condition. The price reflects this poorer condition box.
Will ship to UK only.
Shipping via Myhermes direct to your door including tracking, £5.
Payment via Paypal or cash for local pickup.
Will combine shipping with other items for lower cost where possible.</notes>

    <notes>All miniatures and tiles are there.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably at least 99% of the tokens, as well.  I tried to count them, but the rulebook wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t always clear what each token was supposed to be so I gave up.  Selling this AS-IS and has been discounted to reflect that. 
Includes expansion.
Both boxes have some wear. Base box has corners starting to split. Please see pictures - https://goo.gl/photos/TAHsLNe9zyXipXLW9. Dice have wear, but there also appears to be an extra set, which is engraved instead of printed.
Will be heavy to ship.</notes>

    <notes>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:
This game looks good, with components in (very) good condition. Only missing one red teleporter token; the rest has been counted and is complete.
However, the game, comes from a smoker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s home; hence the low price.
Box and manuals have a strong smoke odor.
Contents are looking very good, apart from the mentioned smoke odor.
All miniatures can be washed if need be.
Counters have not so much a smoke smell, but are looking in very good condition.
Floor tiles also in good condition, with a medium smell.
Can also be used for spare parts.</notes>
