The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows. The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed. With billions dead, humans turned their weapons of mass destruction on their own cities to deny the enemy control. Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games. One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system.

Theme: Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games.

In Gears of War: The Board Game, you’ll relive classic moments from Gears of War and Gears of War 2 – Roadie Run into cover, spray your enemy with blind fire, or rip him in half with your Lancer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s chainsaw!

    <notes>Opened but never played.  Everything is complete and unused.  Bagged for your convenience.  I wanted to try this as I am a Gears fan, but the rest of my club objected to the video game shoehorned into a board game theme, so it was not to be.
Shipping will be by USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Box unless buyer requests otherwise.  Local pickup accepted in Winter Park, FL.  Contact me for details.  This is the only option for which COD is accepted.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 96oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Game has only been played once and is in great condition. Unfortunately, when it arrived two of the miniatures were damaged, snapped off their bases, but these could be easily repaired. All miniatures, cards and boards are here and all are in excellent, like new condition with no wear and tear. I have set the condition as very good purely as a result of the 2 miniatures that were damaged upon my receipt of the game from the vendor.
Seller located in South London but happy for buyer to collect from either South or North London to save on shipping costs.
The cash on delivery payment option applies to collection only. Not available if the game needs to be shipped/couriered.
If shipping or courier delivery is required, I will obtain a quote and let the prospective buyer know the shipping cost in order to confirm the sale.</notes>

The insert as been cut up.  I flipped it over and cut little flaps into the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;pockets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; to hold everything better.  I can take pictures of it if need be.

    <notes>Brand new in shrink wrap. 
I ship daily and will ship your item the next day after receiving payment. I will only charge you the actual cost of shipping. Most normal size games fit in a flat rate box and ship for $12, while some larger items may cost more. Some very small games will cost less. I will ship worldwide, but understand that shipping packages outside of the United States is very expensive. Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the insert anymore but everything is packaged and carefully stored in a smoke free environment. The components are like new as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played the game once.

    <notes>There is some wear on the box but not a huge amount. It is noticeable, however. The rule book is in very good condition. It still looks nice but you can tell it has been read. The rest of the components look great. All in like new condition and the cards are all sleeved.
Buyer pays shipping. I recommend asking for a shipping estimate before buying, but that is up to you. I will combine shipping for multiple orders, so check out my other items I have for sale to save money on shipping. I accept payment through Paypal or Dwolla (preferred due to cheaper fees). Payment is expected within 24 hours of receipt of final bill including shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Thank you for checking out my listing!
This RARE game is NEW and never played!! 
I took the shrink off to inventory the components to verify completeness (which is something I always do with rare and out-of-print stuff since you cannot get replacements for them any longer). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to say that everything is there and 100% complete along with being in in MINT condition!
Even the box looks immaculate!
After seeing all the great things about this game, I really wanted to play it but it just never happened...so here it is and it needs to go to a home where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get the love it deserves!  
Feel free to ask any questions I may not have answered for you here. 
International buyers are welcome!</notes>

    <notes>Gears of War! Gone through campaign, so happy to let it find a new home.
Box is worn-ish (structurally no damage), has some tape to hold an edge together.
Inside, components are in very good condition, nothing noteable. All minis, tiles, cards, etc. a gently used game all in all.
Buyer pays shipping. Kind of a heavy game, but USPS should do the trick to keep shipping cost down. Ships from Boston area.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the Gears of War board game and Mission Pack 1. With the base game, the insert tray has been removed, but the minis are still in their original bags and other components have been bagged. Mission Pack 1 is still new in its clam shell packaging. 
Also included are General Raam and Skorge HeroClix miniatures. The base game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s campaign normally has you use a proxy mini for Skorge and Mission Pack 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s campaign has you use a proxy mini for General Raam, but you can use these two miniatures to avoid having to proxy them.
Smoke-free home. Shipping is already included in the price.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink. Some corner dings and minor dents in boxes (similar to photo shown here).
PayPal payment to: paypal.me/JohnDowning16 (this is a URL so copy and paste into your browser).
I ship quickly after payment is made, usually next day. I use USPS priority mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is less expensive. I round up to the full dollar amount. International shipping from the US is very expensive, so please ask for a quote or do your own research on the approximate cost before you add this to your cart. Ships from 52240.
Ask if you have any questions. Thanks!</notes>
