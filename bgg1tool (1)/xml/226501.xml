   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dragonfire is a cooperative deck-building game set within the world of Dungeons _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Dragons. Players choose from a number of races _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; from dwarf to elf, half-orc to human _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; while assuming the quintessential roles of cleric, rogue, fighter, and wizard. Equipped with weapons, spells, and magic items, players begin their adventure along the famed Sword Coast, then expand to other locales across the Forgotten Realms, such as Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep in future expansions. Along the way, players level up their characters, opening access to additional equipment, feats, and more. Join the quest, and build your own legend!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Current Story Road Map:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1.

    <notes>INCLUDES THE CHARACTER PACK
DragonFire as picked up from Gencon, WITH THE CHARACTER PACK INCLUDED.
NO STICKERS used. I used paper to take any notes.
Everything is basically as new. Gently played, just solo. A bit tricky solo, so want it to find a new home. 
Buys pays shipping. Its a standard size large-ish box; it might fit into a medium flat rate box (TBD). I can ship however buyer wants. Local pickup in Boston area welcome.</notes>

    <notes>This bundle includes the Dragonfire base game along with the Heroes of the Sword Coast, Wonderous Treasures, Shadows over Dragonspear Castle, and Chaos in the Trollclaws expansions. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also be including the Broken Token sleeved card organizer I bought for the game as well. 
The game has been played several times but there is little to no wear on any cards. Three of the character cards have had two stickers applied each.
Shipping is included!!</notes>

    <notes>This listing includes the following:
- Dragonfire core game (sleeved)
- Dragonfire: Character Pack - Heroes of the Sword Coast (sleeved)
- Dragonfire: Wondrous Treasures (sleeved)
- Dragonfire: Adventures - Shadows Over Dragonspear Castle
- Dragonfire: Adventures - Chaos in the Trollclaws
- Dragonfire: Hidden Treasures promo pack
The core game, character pack, and Wondrous Treasures have been opened, sleeved in Premium Mayday Games sleeves, organized together in the box, and played twice (no marks ever made on character sheets, no stickers ever applied). There are also some extra sleeves in the box in case any split.
The Shadows Over Dragonspear Castle expansion has been opened and perused, but never played. The Chaos in the Trollclaws expansion is still new in shrink.
The Hidden Treasures promo pack contains all 52 cards. Players are supposed to receive one of these when they attend a store demo, but this is the full pack. It has been opened and perused, but never played with or shuffled in.
Will ship in the US and calculate shipping once a zip code is available.</notes>

    <notes>I have a very lightly-used copy of Dragonfire for sale, a cooperative deckbuilding card game by Catalyst (the creators of Shadowrun Crossfire)!  All the cards have been sleeved since day 1 and are in pristine condition!  Some of the components have never even been used, including the sticker sets for the character sheets.  I have it available to the first buyer at a steal of a price!  Enjoy!</notes>

Game is in very good condition and has been verified as complete including the original instructions are also present. Never been played so none of the stickers have been removed. The decks of cards are still sealed. The tokens have been punched and stored in a ziploc bag. Box has a little storage wear and has a small label on the box top but overall the box is in very good shape. Plastic storage tray/box insert is also present.
Big box, will not fit in a flat rate so shipping could be high if you live far away from Missouri.</notes>

Also contains the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Character Pack – Heroes of the Sword Coast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion that was being sold at GenCon 2017 in the box. In addition to all that goodness this sale also includes the following NEW IN SHRINK:
Hidden Treasures
Wondrous Treasures
Chaos in the Trollclaws Adventure Pack
Shadows over Dragonspear Castle Adventure Pack
I am not interested in splitting this lot up. 
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 6.25 pounds so figure an extra pound or so of packing material.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:

    <notes>This includes the base game and the following expansions that have been played a few times but are in great condition:
Heroes of the Sword Coast character pack
Shadows over Dragonspear Castle adventure pack
Wondrous Treasures (adds to the magic item deck)
Chaos in the Trollclaws adventure pack
Sea of Swords adventure pack
Everything fits easily into the base game box with plenty of room for more expansions.
The cards are in a BCW box bottom with laminated dividers by card type (market, adventure, magic item rarity, etc.). I also scanned and laminated the stickers from the base game with the intention of cutting them out and using sticky tack to hold the xp feats to the player shields (instead of using stickers) but I never actually cut them out and just tracked stickers with pencil and paper. These laminated sheets as well as all stickers (all are unused) from the base game and expansions are included. I printed and laminated the free adventure found on the Dragonfire website and some other fan-made material for the Sea of Swords adventure found on BGG that are included as well.
Buyer pays shipping from 65203 (Missouri) to the USA.</notes>

    <notes>Includes core game, Shadows over Dragonspear Castle Adventure Pack, Heroes of the Sword Coast Character Pack, Wondrous Treasure pack. A few stickers have been used, and the game is in great shape.  My cat liked to sit on this box in particular for some reason, and she knocked this one off the dining room chair, so one of the corners is a little mooshed, but not bad.
All Dragonfire deck cards and magical items cards are sleeved because the card stock used wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t great and would nick and chip fairly easily.  This is a great game and this package is a great way to get started!

    <notes>Up for grabs is a copy of Dragonfire with the following:
Heroes of the Sword Coast Character pack
Shadows over Dragonspear Castle 
and
Chaos in the Trollclaws.
Some of the character sheets have been used, however, I used Crayola washable markers (1 included), which comes off really easy with just a little water and a towel.    
This also has a custom foamboard insert I made to hold the cards, it is super handy.
Thanks for looking!
Shipping will be $15.00.</notes>
