   <description>Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula Dé with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;stop_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Dashboard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; with movable pegs to manage your car_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Fuel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula Dé Mini), and a lot of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;after market_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been telling you about it recently - F1 is making a comeback in stores: Formula Dé is dead, long live Formula D! Get ready to push your engine to its limit, to hug the curves in the tight corners, but also to keep up with your opponents to take advantage of the air flow and pass them to win... Taking risks and planning ahead are two qualities you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need as a pilot if you want to stand on the highest step of the podium!
Formula D is also the excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes: custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks... The game mechanics stay the same, but use specific rules, cars and tracks.
You will also discover, in this new edition of Formula D, elements unseen up to now, such as painted race cars, dashboards, pilot profiles, and tracks... Very soon we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll unveil the new, high-tech elements which have been created in our ultra-secret lab.

    <notes>Hi!  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling Formula D PLUS the Chicago/Sebring expansion.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played the main game once and never played the expansion.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got all pieces with no obvious wear or tear, plus I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve very nicely taped the corners of the box to prevent the most common wear to games.  
The price, again, includes the game and expansion.  Seller pays shipping from their preferred vendor (USPS, UPS or FedEx).  Email me with any questions!

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMFD01US)
Enter the high-octane world of Formula D racing! Formula D is the exciting game of professional racing on the most challenging tracks the world has ever seen. Smoke your tires, push your engine to the limit, and drive as fast as you dare. Every turn might be your last, so plan carefully and drive lucky. Keep control in those tricky bottlenecks, slipstream the drivers in front of you, and make your move at just the right time to slip past and claim first place. This updated version of the classic racing game also includes daring illegal street races through crowded metropolitan streets and back alleys. The principles remain the same, but now you can customize your car, fire off nitrous in the straightaways, and drive as dirty as you want - if you can get away with it. New cars, new drivers, and new tracks await in this exciting twist on the original classic. The rules of Formula D are easy to learn, but getting good at this game takes practice and smarts. With upgraded components including fully three-dimensional gear boxes, painted cars and beautifully illustrated race tracks, the new Formula D is guaranteed to get your blood racing. Basic rules will have you playing right out of the box, so climb in, buckle up, and start your engines! </notes>

Enter the high-octane world of Formula D racing! Formula D is an exciting game of professional racing on the most challenging tracks the world has ever seen. Smoke your tires, push your engine to the limit, and drive as fast as you dare. Every turn might be your last, so plan carefully and drive lucky. Maintain control in those tricky bottlenecks, draft behind the drivers in front of you, and make your move at just the right time to slip past and claim first place. This version of the classic racing game also includes daring illegal urban races through crowded metropolitan streets and back alleys. The principles remain the same, but now you can customize your car, fire off nitrous in the straightaways, and drive as nefariously as you desire - if you can get away with it. New cars, new drivers, and new tracks await in this exciting twist to the original classic. The rules of Formula D are easy to learn, but becoming a top-tier driver takes practice and smarts. With upgraded components which include fully three-dimensional gear boxes, painted cars and beautifully illustrated race tracks, the new Formula D is guaranteed to get your blood racing. Basic rules will have you playing right out of the box, so climb in, buckle up, and start your engines! </notes>

Formula D is F1 and also the excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes: custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks... The game mechanics stay the same, but use specific rules, cars and tracks.
Formula D is also the excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes: custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks... The game mechanics stay the same, but use specific rules, cars and tracks. 
This edition of Formula D comes with 2 boards: Monaco and Muscle Cars. Although it will be compatible with the old edition boards, those boards will not be reprinted. Instead, new boards will be created to expand the available tracks for more racing fun. This edition also contains elements unseen up to now, such as painted race cars, dashboards, pilot profiles, and tracks 
Components: 
· 2 game boards 
· 20 painted cars 
· 70 plastic parts (marker _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; gear sticks) 
· 2 sets of playing instructions 
· score boards 
· 7 special dice 
· 10 dashboards

    <notes>This was opened and never actually played.  Bought it a few months ago but could never get it to the table.
I also have the first track expansion still in shrink which I will throw in for $15 more.
The game does not come with the insert, like most people, I threw it out with the intention of fitting a couple expansion tracks in the box.
Shipping will be $12 to the US</notes>

    <notes>This game is in fantastic condition, however on delivery to the shop the box was squashed so a slight indent on the bottom and a scuff on the corner of the outer box is present. The insert cracked slightly as a result. The contents however remain in perfect condition.
Only played a handful of times and just wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a big hit with the group, as such it has to go.
Shipping to the UK is £4 please contact me if postage to another country is required.</notes>

Enter the high-octane world of Formula D racing! Formula D is an exciting game of professional racing on the most challenging tracks the world has ever seen. Smoke your tires, push your engine to the limit, and drive as fast as you dare. Every turn might be your last, so plan carefully and drive lucky. Maintain control in those tricky bottlenecks, draft behind the drivers in front of you, and make your move at just the right time to slip past and claim first place. This version of the classic racing game also includes daring illegal urban races through crowded metropolitan streets and back alleys. The principles remain the same, but now you can customize your car, fire off nitrous in the straightaways, and drive as nefariously as you desire - if you can get away with it. New cars, new drivers, and new tracks await in this exciting twist to the original classic. The rules of Formula D are easy to learn, but becoming a top-tier driver takes practice and smarts. With upgraded components which include fully three-dimensional gear boxes, painted cars and beautifully illustrated race tracks, the new Formula D is guaranteed to get your blood racing. Basic rules will have you playing right out of the box, so climb in, buckle up, and start your engines!</notes>

English 2013 edition. Board shows wear/whitening at some edges and corners. All other components present and in good condition. Have one extra gear stick and two extra markers for wear points. 
Insert has rips in corners but is still functioning. Box suffered major damage en route to us. Multiple corners were split and have been taped and two corners are dinged. Rules look read but not bent.

I do have the first circuit for sale as well (at the time I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m posting this). If you buy them together I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll knock 5 bucks off the total.</notes>

Buyer pays $12 (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy) for shipping via USPS Priority Mail.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll discount combined shipping if you also buy anything else I have for sale.  If paying by personal check, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll wait 5 business days for check to clear.

    <notes>The rulebook list of game material says that there should be 20 damage markers.  I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find anything that might be damage markers, and the rulebook never refers to them again, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m baffled.  On the other hand, we have 20 weather tokens that are not listed in the contents but are discussed elsewhere in the rules, so there could just be a mistake in the list of contents.  Aside from the possible missing damage markers, contents are complete and in excellent condition.  Game also includes ten extra cars.  Box is in excellent condition.
We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge actual postage via Royal Mail, or we can coordinate pick-up in London.</notes>

The big box insert has some cracks in it - this is a big, heavy game.  Otherwise, everything_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in great condition.  (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the second owner - I got it in a trade.)
Box is in very good condition, with some minor shelfwear.
This box is very heavy; please take that into consideration when ordering if you aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t close to my location.

    <notes>This game was only played once by me and my children. All of the components are in barely used, like new condition. The box is still sturdy with no issues EXCEPT that it came to me new with one half split corner and another corner with some weird paper peeling. None of this affects gameplay, but I do note it here for those of you who are very concerned about box appearance. If that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s you, stay away from this one.
