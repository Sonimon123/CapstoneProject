The storyteller says a sentence or a word connected to his picture, then each player chooses one of his pictures to bet upon. All pictures are showed face up, and every player have to bet upon what picture was the storyteller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.

Each player at his turn plays the storyteller. He is given a single picture, while the other players get a hand of six pictures.
The storyteller says a sentence or a word connected to his picture, then each player chooses one of his pictures to bet upon. All pictures are showed face up, and every player has to bet upon what picture was the storyteller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.
If nobody or everybody finds the correct picture, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer scores 3. Players score 1 point for every vote gotten by their own pic.
The game ends when the deck is empty. The greatest total wins the game.

One player is the storyteller for the turn. He looks at the 6 images in his hand. From one of these, he makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).
The other players select amongst their 6 images the one that best matches the sentence made up by the storyteller.
Then, each of them gives their selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others. The storyteller shuffles his card with all the received cards. All pictures are showed face up, randomly, and every player has to bet upon what picture was the storyteller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.
If nobody or everybody finds the correct picture, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer scores 3. Players score 1 point for every vote gotten by their own pic.
The game ends when the deck is empty. The greatest total wins the game.

    <notes>Not the game Dixit!
Instead, I have components from Dixit: Journey to use with the original game for scoring.  Journey has 6 pawns, chits for choosing images, but most appealing is the score track with rules summary.  I like using a score track much more than the box insert (I have the score track from Odyssey)  These components have never been used.
I can include the Journey box, though there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no room for any extra cards.  Alternatively, I can likely fit the board and components in a large padded envelope/smaller box to save on shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also willing to trade the components for a small card game or something like that.
Ships from 04222.  Local pickup_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an option in Mid-Coast Maine.</notes>

Each player at his turn plays the storyteller. He is given a single picture, while the other players get a hand of six pictures. The storyteller says a sentence or a word connected to his picture, then each player chooses one of his pictures to bet upon. All pictures are showed face up, and every player have to bet upon what picture was the storyteller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s. </notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Dixit
Description: Dixit in mint/sealed condition. Shrinkwrap has a small tear on the front. Looks like the Libellud third edition English version distributed by Asmodee.
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

Take advantage of my shelf-space woes!  When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive.  To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>Played this 5 or 6 times, the cards edges are white and are slightly discolored now from handling. I noticed two cards that have a slight crease in the corner.  I photographed one front and back. Everything is there and the game is really in nice condition and very playable.  Box corners are slightly scuffed but not torn.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMDIX01)
Every picture tells a story - but what story will your picture tell? Dixit is the lovingly illustrated game of creative guesswork, where your imagination unlocks the tale. In this award-winning board game, players will use the beautiful imagery on their cards to bluff their opponents and guess which image matches the story. Guessing right is only half the battle - to really succeed, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to get your friends to decide that your card tells the story! Every turn, the storyteller will call out a short phrase or word to match the image on his card. Then each player will choose the card that most closely matches that phrase, and then everyone must guess which card the storyteller saw when he invented his brief tale. Correctly guess the storyteller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll move ahead. Convince everyone else that your card is best, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do even better.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMDIX01)
Every picture tells a story - but what story will your picture tell? Dixit is the lovingly illustrated game of creative guesswork, where your imagination unlocks the tale. In this award-winning board game, players will use the beautiful imagery on their cards to bluff their opponents and guess which image matches the story. Guessing right is only half the battle - to really succeed, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to get your friends to decide that your card tells the story! Every turn, the storyteller will call out a short phrase or word to match the image on his card. Then each player will choose the card that most closely matches that phrase, and then everyone must guess which card the storyteller saw when he invented his brief tale. Correctly guess the storyteller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll move ahead. Convince everyone else that your card is best, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do even better.</notes>

    <notes>Description
The players have hands of oversized cards with various artistic pictures. The active player secretly selects one of his cards and gives a very brief description. The other players secretly select their own cards which match the description. The chosen cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which was chosen by the active player.Each correct answer gives points to the guesser and the active player. Each incorrect answer gives points to the player who submitted the guessed card. However, if all of the guesses are correct -- or none of them are -- then the active player gets no points and all the other players get points.The game ends when the deck is empty. The greatest total wins the game.
