   <description>Fremde Federn, which means roughly _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;to adorn oneself with borrowed plumes,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or something like _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;strange feathers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fremde Federn is about borrowing elements from well-known games (Eurogames) and constructing a new game out of them. For now, it is a deck-building, worker-placement, drafting race game. The print-and-play files _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; German only for now _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; are available on the 2F-Spiele website._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You are a politician who tries to gather enough money and influence to become the next president. Of course, you depend on the work of others to get the needed influence. You start with a set of 10 cards (7 of them are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fatherly friends,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; which give you 1 money each and 3 of them yield 1 influence each (VPs)). Each round you draw 5 cards from your deck and use one card for the turn order to place your workers. The workers go to the different offices in the government building to buy new cards for you, get influence or to carry out other actions. Each round there is one more space in which you can choose to place your workers. On the game board is a row of cards which you can choose to buy and each round the empty places in this row are filled from a deck of cards divided into 4 different _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Ages._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; The last cards of the deck are Doctoral degrees which you can buy with your money; these give you 1 VP for each unit of money spent. The game ends when all of the Doctoral degrees are bought or when one player has 95 VPs or more._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO483)
In a fable commonly attributed to Aesop, a jackdaw adorned himself with borrowed plumes to make himself appear more majestic than he actually was, only to be exposed by his peers. Although the fable is ancient, its moral, do not strut in borrowed plumes lest you risk being exposed, still holds true today. You do not have to live in a banana republic, in which corruption, betrayal and deception are common place, to be bribed, deceived and cheated. And if it can happen in your own circle of friends, which can have an especially painful and bitter effect, it can certainly happen on the big stage of politics. In fact, politics is a hotbed of power-hungry and egocentric personalities, who will often stop at nothing to advance their own political careers and agendas. Money changes hands, empty promises are made, shameless lies are told and power is abused, and: some people even buy their own doctor titles! Any similarities to real people or events, whether in image or content, are purely coincidental and not deliberate! Put yourself in the shoes of a politician and start your political campaign. In _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Copycat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, the end justifies the means: it is not how you are elected, but that you are elected. Collect victory points to move around the career path as far as possible. So, put away your scruples, stick out your elbows, and let your political campaign begin! </notes>

Buyer pays shipping. I use flat rate shipping boxes from the post office, so this game will be $16.85 to ship because it is a large game. Shipping from Humble, TX, 77396, to continental US only. 
Payment is via Paypal only.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in great condition. Is was given as a gift, used, but looked unplayed; and has been played once since. Did not catch on with my game group... and competes with too many other clever _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;60min. euros on my shelf. Will ship from 04011 (Brunswick, ME).  Local pickup in the area is fine.</notes>
