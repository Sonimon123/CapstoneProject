   <description>Reef Encounter is about life on a coral reef! Using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four shrimp counters. To be successful players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal and Java). Most importantly they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description from the designer, Richard Breese._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Reef Encounter of the Second Kind_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Original shrinkwrap, limited to 1000 copies, exclusively for sale at Spiel 2004 Essen by Richard Breese himself !
It is 99% sure that this game will NOT be reproduced due to the heavy costs of the material (handmade shrimps).
Payment : transfer money to my bankaccount.
Mail me for shipping and handling. :-)

I can accept Paypal if necessary. Please add 5% if you wish to use this service.  Plenty of other shipping methods are availible.
I also have a couple copies with slight damage to one corner.  If you wish to save a few more dollars, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling them with a $4 discount, so just make me an offer of $95.80 and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll know you want a slightly damaged copy (hardly damaged at all, but still worth a discount).
At this time, I am expecting my copies to arrive by December 15th.  I expect I will be sold out quickly, so don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate!</notes>

    <notes>My game group bought two copies of this game in the panic to get the one copy - we were willing to spend $235 + shipping for both in the event that one was damaged or lost in customs we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d still have the one - indeed, insane to say the least.  We bought one from Great Britain and one from Germany - paid a premium on one copy and got a deal (somewhat) on another. 
We are keeping the other copy and have played it twice.  Once with 4 persons and once with 2 persons.  I must say, it is a great game and I am glad that we have it.
What I offer to you is one new copy of this game, unpunched, with 5th algea in an opened (unsealed) perfect box.  As new.
It has the 5th algae as mentioned here: 
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/61926 
Price?  To the US and Canada - $135 including all shipping, handling, paypal and BGG fees.  It will be shipped Priority Mail in the US with insurance and delivery confirmation.  It will be shipped First Class to Canada including insurance.  The rest of the world, please add $25 for postage.
Payment?  Paypal only.
I have not sold anything on BGGM, but if you look up my user name on eBay I have 100% positive with over 500 feedback. </notes>

    <notes>Z Man Games.  Shipping:  actual cost.
Condition is very good, but there is very minor wear on the box corners and the rule book has been perused enough that it is lightly wrinkled.  Other components like new.</notes>

    <notes>This is a really beautiful game that I wanted to get to play but it just ain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t happening. It was originally a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ding and dent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; game from Thought Hammer, meaning that there is some extremely minor damage to the box exterior. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included close up pictures so you can peruse and inspect the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;damage_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; with your magnifying glass. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never played the game; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s punched and bagged, though. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll make sure to package it well, to ensure minimal shifting in transit. I have two other games up for sale (T_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;E and Caylus) - if you want more than one maybe we can work something out where I pay a part of shipping or something. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not doing this to make a killing - basically I just need to free up some shelf space so my wife won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t badger me about getting more games whenever I get Conquest of Paradise, Blackbeard, Titan, Hannibal, Lords of Samurai, and um... a few others I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve already pre-ordered.</notes>

    <notes>Original, limited edition R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D version.
Never played.  Pieced have been punched but never really used.  It is as close to mint as an open item can be.  Box has no visible damage or shelf wear on it.
Need to get rid of some games now that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in a smaller place.
In the US I will ship priority mail for $10.  If you want insurance or tracking I can add that on for whatever it costs.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll will ship outside the USA.  Email me for a price quote.
I prefer PayPal but will accept personal checks.  For personal checks I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll hold the game until it clears.
If the game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t as I describe I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give a full refund upon return of the game.
If you have any question please contact me.

    <notes>QWG - Reef Encounter
Language: Dutch _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; French
2 to 4 players
10 year and older
Duration: 60 to 120 min
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,365 kg
Theme: Reef Encounter is about life on a coral reef! Using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four wooden shrimp. To be successful players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the ‘consumed’ polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses: most importantly they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game.

    <notes>Reef Encounter (original edition) from R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D Games
Box: Very light shelfwear with some indentation on the bottom that has caused a very small split right at the corner.  Overall the box is in very good to excellent condition.
Components: Complete and in excellent condition!  Components look like the game was barely played.  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged. 
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. from zip code 85208. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.

    <notes>This is the second edition of Reef Encounter (Z-man games). Major problem with the game is that the box has two crushed corners and a split edge on one side. It was damaged in shipping. Game components themselves are complete and in excellent condition, the game only having been played once.</notes>

    <notes>Reef Encounter, Z-Man Games edition.  Mostly in excellent condition.  I downgraded to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because:
- There is some white showing on edges and corners of the box
- Two of the player screens have visible creases
Everything else is in excellent condition.
I also have the expansion Reef Encounter of the Second Kind for sale and will take $5 off (total) if you buy both.  Check it out!</notes>

    <notes>Box has wear, including some dishing on bottom, and a slightly crushed corner. The yellow fish screen has some cracking on the paper coating where it folds. The rest of the components look like new, and are nicely bagged. I usually ship within 24 hours and pack very carefully. No smoke house. I pack well! I prefer if you can use Paypal friends option so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to pay fees on the actual shipping cost. I use USPS only, but will work to get the best rate, especially if regional is an option! Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>This includes the expansion which is still in shrink. I accept Google Wallet as well as PayPal. If using PayPal please add 2.5% if not using Family and Friends. The game will be shipped the next business day after receipt of payment. Unsure of shipping but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to get both games in medium sized box. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind the shrink coming off, then it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll work, but if you want the expansion shrink wrapped then they may have to go into a Large USPS flat rate box.</notes>

Beautiful production quality. The pictures really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do it justice. This tropical fish-themed strategy game introduced our family to the fun and joy of table top gaming.  Complete and in very good condition and ready to play.  It is almost worth keeping on my shelf for the adorable shrimp meeples.

    <notes>Box has moderate whitening, shelf wear, and creasing, but is structurally sound. 
Components are 100% complete. Some of the wooden tokens are missing small amounts of paint or have residue from other paint colors. This is minor and should not affect game play. All other components are in very good condition. 
Rule book has very minor wrinkling from water damage.</notes>
