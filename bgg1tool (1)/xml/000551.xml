   <description>A low complexity game of a variety of civil war battles.  Modular terrain through the use of hexagonal tiles allows for the setup of several famous civil war battle fields and a plethora of plastic civil war miniatures are used to represent the various forces during the conflict (infantry, cavalry, artillery and leaders).  Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg's Command and Colors system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game rules include the following scenarios:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;First Bull Run--21st July, 1861_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Pea Ridge--7th March, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Kernstown--23rd March, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Shiloh--6th April, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gaines Mill--27th June, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Brawner's Farm--28th August, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Antietam--17th September, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fredericksburg--13th December, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Murfreesboro--31st December, 1862_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Chancellorsville--3rd May, 1863_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gettysburg--2nd July, 1863_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gettysburg--3rd July, 1863_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Chickamauga--20th September, 1863_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;New Market--15th May, 1864_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;New Hope Church--25th May, 1864_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Pieces are off the sprues, flags have been applied. Looks as if the game was never played, as the cards show no signs of ever having been shuffled. One box corner has a slight _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;drop_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mark, and one other has a tiny bit of scuffing. Other than that, this one is solid.</notes>

    <notes>Great condition.  Only problem is missing one flag carrying infantryman, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it I think.  Besides, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if there are many missions that call for all of them anyways...  Message me for more details, pictures, etc.
Shipping is probably about 10 bucks, plus insurance if you want it.  Might be less though.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take most forms of payment, but the game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t going anywhere till I have cash from a check, etc.</notes>

    <notes>Game is opened but unpunched/unplayed.  Box lid has a moderate dent in it from something heavy being placed on top.  Contains the Stonewall scenario booklet available (I think) from Origins one year.
Domestic shipping will be $11.00. International shipping will probably be in the neighborhood of $30.00 but you should contact me for a specifc quote prior to purchasing.
Please take a look at my other games for sale. I will definitely save you money on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>NOTE!!!  This is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy only.  Its well used.  Box has considerable shelfwear and has a tear up one side edge of the title box top.  As well, the Confederate artillery has two units missing its wheels.  The Union army is missing 4 units although I obtained the 4 missing pieces via a generous BGG member (however, they are Rebel army pieces which just need to be painted and all sides will have all the pieces, 1 artillery unit is missing its wheels here as well).  Gameboard is well used and has started developing a slight tear along the crease lines of the board.  It will never be a showpiece, but the game is in playing shape.
I expect shipping to be higher than usual due to box size and weight.</notes>

International shipping will be painful, I am guessing, due to box size and weight.  International buyers please contact me before purchasing.</notes>

    <notes>All components are present and in great shape.  Some of the flags are loose, but you can just squeeze them back on if they come free.  (this is common to all the Battle Cry sets I have seen.)
Let me know if you have any questions.

Leadership card has been _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fixed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; with permanent marker according to FAQ.
Also includes printout of three extra battles, as well as the FAQ.
Will ship after paid in full, checks and MOs accepted, but need to be cleared. PayPal fees resulting from paying with a Debit/Credit Card will be passed to the buyer.
Shipping and handling is covered by buyer, and should be around $15 (but will check to make sure).
I will send the buyer quotes for different options, and you can pick your preferred shipping option (from USPS). Insurance is $1.35 and optional, but recommended as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not responsible for mailing issues once the game is mailed.

    <notes>The game is new - opened from shrink wrap, but cards remain in shrink, tiles have not been punched, and troops remain unpunched. The reason the game is priced as it is is that some of the stickers for flags are missing - however,  there is a color print out of actual Civil War Flags included, and more can be found on Battle Cry Websites.Other than the missing stickers for about 20 troops, the game is brand new. A great buy for a person that prefers true Regiment flags. The box, like the rest of the game is in prefect condition. Shipping will be actual based on how the buyer wants the game shipped. </notes>

    <notes>NOTE: This is the Hasbro/Avalon Hill 1999/2000 edition of Battle Cry.  This is NOT the 2010 reprint.
The game is unpunched and unplayed. The game is no longer in shrinkwrap, but it has never been played or setup.  The plastic pieces are still on the 4 sprues. The card deck is unopened.  The terrain tiles/field works/campaign markers are unpunched.  The labels are still on the label sheet.
The game box is in incredibly great shape after 10+ years.  On the box top, you can see indentations where other boxes have sit on top.  These indentations are small and you have to really look for them.  It appears that the printing on the box covers (both top and bottom) are still intact.
Game comes from non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>(shipping to US only...  $16.00)  light shelf wear to the box _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;see pics_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.. components are in great shape.
A low complexity game of a variety of civil war battles. Modular terrain through the use of hexagonal tiles allows for the setup of several famous civil war battle fields and a plethora of plastic civil war miniatures are used to represent the various forces during the conflict (infantry, cavalry, artillery and leaders). Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield.
This game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Command and Colors system.
The game rules include the following scenarios:
First Bull Run--21st July, 1861
Pea Ridge--7th March, 1862
Kernstown--23rd March, 1862
Shiloh--6th April, 1862
Gaines Mill--27th June, 1862
Brawner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Farm--28th August, 1862
Antietam--17th September, 1862
Fredericksburg--13th December, 1862
Murfreesboro--31st December, 1862
Chancellorsville--3rd May, 1863
Gettysburg--2nd July, 1863
Gettysburg--3rd July, 1863
Chickamauga--20th September, 1863
New Market--15th May, 1864
New Hope Church--25th May, 1864</notes>

    <notes>Description: Battle Cry Used/Complete. Box is a bit mushed and one corner is split with tape holding it together. All pieces are accounted for. One tile is a bit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;chewed up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, but still usable. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve taken the time to reattach all the flags to their pieces, but they can/will come off given the adhesive used on the stickers when they were made many years ago.
Shipping Weight: 5 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>
