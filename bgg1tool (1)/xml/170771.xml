Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes' souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This base game contains ACT I of III._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

**Also, as this Kickstarter was split into two shipping waves (Act 1 and Act 2) due to delays on the finished project, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll request to change the shipping address for the second wave of shipping to avoid any extra shipping (thus buying my while KS pledge and entire Legendary KS Pledge).  And if you move, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do it again, whatever it takes, no solid date on the second wave yet.</notes>

These materials are contained in the Kickstarter edition base game box, which is opened, and the sealed, new-in-shrink Vastaryous_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Lair wave 1 box.  The base game has been played 3 times by the same 2 players; most contents are entirely unused, and any used contents were handled very carefully to preserve like-new condition.
Wave 2 materials and extras (digital code for Battlebards soundtracks, etc.) will be sent on immediately after receiving them.  There will be no additional shipping costs associated with wave 2 within the continental U.S.  Buyers outside the continental U.S., I will cover up to $20 of the shipping costs for wave 2.
Check out my feedback and buy with confidence.  I take exceptionally good care of my games.  This is a non-smoking household without pets, so you can be sure there is no environment-caused damage to your purchase.
I ship via the lowest cost insurable method of UPS or USPS.  This 16-pound large box is likely to be lowest cost via UPS.</notes>

    <notes>Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery Kickstarter Exclusive Edition: Legendary Hero Pledge
This Special Kickstarter Exclusive Edition of Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery comes with a huge amount of extra content, giving you a whole new campaign and more than doubling the number of enemies, heroes, and master enemies, that come with the standard edition. On top of that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s packed full of extra goodies including deluxe hero sheets, a deck holder, a dice bag, additional cards, and more. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s so much content, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no wonder the box is so huge! 
Five heroes awoke from the dead and were made immortal to save the kingdom from the rise of darkness. In Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery - Immortal Souls, up to five players control one or more of these legendary characters brought back to life by powerful sorcery, to fight against the forces of evil, controlled by the game itself.
Heroes grow stronger during their story-driven quests. Along the battles, they acquire soul points that regenerate their souls, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts. An innovative A.I. system allows the control and management of enemies by the players, giving them intelligent behavior and creating interesting battles every time, with no Game Master required.
There is no player elimination - when a hero dies, he becomes a ghost soul, an ethereal form able to use its unique ghost shout against enemies, and then he can resurrect spending Soul points at the Gods altar.
The game features ultra detailed 32mm scale figures and modular boards, several decks of cards, Solo Play, high character customization, sophisticated combat and magic system, and quests designed to be completed in about 90 minutes or less.
Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery is an epic-fantasy cooperative board game in which 1-5 players fight together against the forces of evil, which are controlled by the game system itself.
Each player controls one or more heroes – legendary characters brought back to life by powerful sorcery. Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.
Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders), the game system in Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.
Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure.
Please note that some of the act II material has been delayed by the publisher and will arrive as part of a second wave of shipping. This will be forwarded on as soon as it arrives.</notes>

    <notes>Brand New - Didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t realize I would have to change condition to Like New for simply removing the shrink wrapping to ensure complete with no damage, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new selling on Geek Market. I have an 880 100% feedback rating on eBay, so you can purchase with confidence. The boxes are in mint condition ( apparently many of the boxes shipped damaged - zero damage on the these boxes, which is nice since it appears nobody is getting replacement boxes ). This is for the Dragon Slayer Hero Pledge which includes Kickstarter Edition of Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery, including all the contents of the core set, Kickstarter special contents, and all unlocked stretch goals, PLUS the add-on bundle _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Dragon Slayer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (including Vastaryous_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Lair, Samyria _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bjorn, Onamor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Volkor). SHIPPING CHARGES NOT INCLUDED.
This listing INCLUDES wave 2 when it is shipped. I will ask the buyer to pay for the shipping to ship it. Once I have your address from shipping wave 1 to you, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll contact you to let you know I received wave 2 and can let you know what the shipping cost will be - it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be a penny over what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m charged to ship to you and you can decide how you want it shipped ( UPS, USPS, Fedex, with or without insurance, slow or fast ). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll weight the stuff when it arrives and let you know so you can tell me how you want me to ship it.
NOTE: I did unwrap the game, so it is open, to ensure it is complete with no damaged components - this required me to remove the miniatures from the plastic bags ( just generic shipping bags, nothing worth keeping ) - so the miniatures will ship in the trays, which in my opinion is better so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not all squished up with each other ( heads in between legs, bent/broken weapons ). All miniatures are there, none damaged. Everything else ( e.g. dice, coins ) are still in their shipping bags.  I will provide the unlock codes and instructions after purchase. 
I can take a personal check, but would have to wait for it to clear before shipping. Recommend you provide me your address in advance with shipping preference so I can price what it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be for you. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to shipping Worldwide, but this is heavy and hope it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get damaged going overseas. Email me at gelaar@yahoo.com
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also open to trading for Kingdom Death miniatures ( looking for Forge God, Warlords, Archivist, Phoenix Dancer Pinup, Weaponsmith Pinup ). And I would certainly entertain a trade for the current KD KS pledge and willing to augment dollars from my end as well.</notes>

Everything is new and unplayed. The base game box has had the shrink taken off, and a few of the cards have been opened and inspected, but everything else is still sealed. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not trying to make a profit off of this, just trying to make the money back that I put on the pledge and shipping.
Note that this box of goodies is pretty heavy, I expect shipping will cost quite a bit, probably something like $30-$35. I will only ship to the lower 48 states.
I am in the central Maryland region and will accept local pickup if someone local wishes to come grab it to save on shipping.</notes>

My set has been punched and played a few times but in Like New condition.  Also comes with a plano case for tokens.  If you are also interested in Galaxy Defenders (with big box expansions, red aliens, and promos), I will work a crazy package deal as those figures can also be used in this game with the cards they are including, and of course that game is great too!  
I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to let this go, but some additional expenses came up, and well, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s life!
For those items which has not yet been delivered by Ares, I will also contact Ares to update the shipping information for the next wave as long as they have not already started to ship.  If they are shipping the rest of this and it cannot be changed, I will ship to you on receipt (though the extra shipping will need to be paid by you).
Note that this box of goodies is pretty heavy, I expect shipping will cost quite a bit but happy to quote for you. I will only ship to the lower 48 states.  I am in the southern NH (Salem / Nashua) area and will accept local pickup if someone local wishes to come grab it to save on shipping. 
Paypal only (or cash if local pickup)</notes>

Immortal Hero - You will receive a copy of the Legendary Hero rewards (Kickstarter Edition of Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery, including all the contents of the core set, Kickstarter special contents, and all unlocked stretch goals) PLUS the add-on bundle _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Immortal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (including Vastaryous_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Lair, Samyria _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bjorn, Onamor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Volkor, Doors _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Chests, Additional Dice Set, Metal Crowns, Additional Cloth Bag, Enhanced Hero Figure Set). 
Opened bagged, sorted, and played initial quest.  Enjoyed the game but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be able to invest the time to get the full benefit from the campaign and story this tells.  Shipping likely to be $20-30 as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in two decent sized boxes.
Wave 2 materials will be sent after I get them, current time frame is November last I heard. There will be no additional shipping costs associated with wave 2.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know when they arrive and check to make sure your address is still valid.</notes>

    <notes>THis is the Kickstarter box edition. It comes with Extra hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s All the wave 1 mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, dice bag, Wood looking card holder for the cards in the game ect. The only thing that was off was the mini for the main fighter is missing his shield it came that way from the box. You can see were the part was suppose to go but wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t included. Because of this the price for the kickstarter edition isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t as high as it should be. 
I bought this Kickstarter edition from LFGS. I DO NOT HAVE wave 2 cards stories ect. At the time of this post they have not been shipped yet. I was told I might get these from the store when they receive them. If that is the case I will ship to you free of charge when I receive them. 
Cards, minis (accept for the above mentioned) are in perfect condition as are all components.  This is a heavy large box so expect shipping to be higher than usual depending on where you are.
(slight wear on the corner of box from getting shifted in the truck on the move)</notes>

Contents have been opened and examined, but this game is unplayed.  It will ship in its original box from the manufacturer, which is a nice, thick box - and big!
I can send Wave 2 materials when I receive them for just the cost of shipping.  This should not be much because wave 2 is cards and manuals.
I will ship from 01240 by USPS, and let you know the cost options so you can choose.</notes>

**************************
This is the Kickstarter edition of Sword _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sorcery, including all the bells and whistles:
- Photo album: https://goo.gl/photos/sB4ZAcghczzmhSpw7
- All cards are sleeved and in perfect condition. The original _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wave 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards which were replaced in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wave 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are also included.
- All tiles are in great condition.
- Includes all stretch goals, e.g. the Hollywood Equipment deck.
- Expansions: Arcane Portal, Darkness Falls, Vastaryous_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Lair. NOTE, however, that printed copies of Arcane Portal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s books were NOT included as part of the KS campaign, so the books for Arcane Portal are only in digital format.
- Includes all hero packs available at the time of the Kickstarter, including the Ghost Heroes minis.
- Doors and Chests minis: the doors minis have been painted (but not very well).
- All minis are unpainted except for the doors. All minis are in like-new condition except that (A) i wrote the name of each one on the bottom of the mini and (B) the extremely thin flag pole of the Ghost form of Tristan has broken off. The broken-off flag is included in the kit.
- Cardboard card tray/holder (glued together - cannot be disassembled). (See photo album.)
- Galaxy Defenders alien minis and S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;S crossover cards.
- Extra pack of dice (unopened).
- Pack of metal coins (unopened).
- The main box has slight tearing along one edge (visible in the attached photo) but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only cosmetic - the outer paper layer is affected and the cardboard of the box itself is undamaged.
- The edges of many of the cardboard tokens have been colored with a marker to improve their appearance (see photo album for examples).
- The plastic organizer boxes shown in the attached photograph are NOT included. The tokens and cards are packed in a box and wrapped in baggies.
- The listed price also accounts for the time i spent unbending dozens of the severely bent minis and for the 1.8km which i have to carry this massive package to the post office by foot :|.
Weight: approx. 13kg.
Shipping is via DHL with tracking.
Shipping within Germany: 16.50 Euros
https://www.dhl.de/de/privatkunden/pakete-versenden/deutschlandweit-versenden/paket.html
Shipping to all other EU countries: 34 Euros
https://dhl.de/en/privatkunden/preise/preise-international.html
Shipping to non-EU European countries: 54(!) Euros
https://dhl.de/en/privatkunden/preise/preise-international.html
i can almost always ship within 1 business day of payment, but may (depending on other responsibilities) need 2 days.
Pickup can be arranged (from Geltendorf, Germany) but requires a car - the package is too large to carry by foot, bicycle, moped, or motorcycle. The price will be reduced by 10 Euros in that case (and you would have the option of inspecting the package before deciding to pay for it).
Reason for selling: for a solo player like myself the game is too complex and fiddly (lots of tiny details to remember and keep track of). For best results it requires an intelligence far superior to mine and/or the combined brainpower of multiple players.
If you have further question, feel free to get in touch.</notes>
