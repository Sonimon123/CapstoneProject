   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Lemonade? They want lemonade? What is the world coming to? I want commercials for burgers on all channels, every 15 minutes. We are the Home of the Original Burger, not a hippie health haven. And place a billboard next to that new house on the corner. I want them craving beer every second they sit in their posh new garden._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; The new management trainee trembles in front of the CEO and tries to politely point out that... _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;How do you mean, we don't have enough staff? The HR director reports to you. Hire more people! Train them! But whatever you do, don't pay them any real wages. I did not go into business to become poor. And fire that discount manager, she is only costing me money. From now on, we'll sell gourmet burgers. Same crap, double the price. Get my marketing director in here!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a fast food chain. The focus is on building your company using a card-driven (human) resource management system. Players compete on a variable city map through purchasing, marketing and sales, and on a job market for key staff members. The game can be played by 2-5 serious gamers in 2-4 hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;= 2000 grams
Correio Não Prioritário (Avião) Internacional = 11.75€
Correio Azul Internacional Exprèss = 15,5€
2001 grams to 3000 grams = 29.10€
3001 grams to 4000 grams = 30.25€
4001 grams to 5001 grams = 33€
5001 grams to 6000 grams = 36.90€
6001 grams to 7000 grams = 38€
7001 grams to 8000 grams = 40.50€
8001 grams to 9000 grams = 43€

    <notes>PLEASE NOTE:
THIS IS FCM UPGRADE KIT: IMPROVED RULES, PLAYER AIDS AND TILESET
From the Publisher_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s website:
  
For the 3rd and later printings of Food Chain Magnate, we made a number of improvements based on feedback by players and reviewers:
- We put the Milestone information on the back of the English player menus
- We made a number of clarifications to the rules (but no rule changes)
- We added dots to the 9 and 6 marketeer busy tiles.
In addition, we corrected misprints:
- The 6 on the Executive Vice President in the player menu has become a 10
- Three of the marketing tools that were missing infinity symbols on the back no have them.
This upgrade set is intended for people who have the 1st or 2nd edition of Food Chain Magnate and want to have the new materials.
We are charging a nominal fee plus shipping costs. If there is a lot of demand, we may have to postpone shipping until the 4th print run arrives.
If you order this, you do not need to order the additional tileset, it is included.</notes>

    <notes>This is either the first or second printing which had misprints on the English player aids which were corrected in later printings. The misprinted areas have been corrected by sticking corrected versions over the affected areas using a file posted on BGG by Chaddyboy . This does not affect the gameplay but please take it into account when considering whether to purchase. Played twice.

    <notes>When combined with another board game I am selling, the tileset will be free (instead of the 5 euro shown)
This upgrade set is for people who have the 1st or 2nd edition of Food Chain Magnate and want to have the improvement: the tileset with improved marketing tokens (1, 9 and 10 were missing an infinity symbol on the backside) and new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Busy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tokens for the 6 and 9 marketeer which have little dots on them so as to distinguish them better. 
This tileset can be send as a letter (lower shipping costs)
Please send a message if you are interested and ask for shipping costs to your location. Payment can be done by bank transfer or Pay pal. If you have any other question, please feel free to ask.</notes>

    <notes>Barely played, Excellent condition.
The paper monopoly currency (50 bills only) of the game has some water damage thats why I dropped the price. Other than that the game is perfect.
To explain the damage: I didnt use the paper currency since I prefer using power grid currency and poker chips. Therefore it was left outside the box for a while and a cup of water spilled beside them. I dopped the price 30 dollars.
I can provide pics 
NOTE: I accept cryptocurrency payments as well (Bitcoin litecoin ethereum or any other)</notes>

    <notes>This item is posted as a part of the WargameHQ Shelf Clearing Auction.
The item listed is only for purchase by:
rskaramanyan
The price has been set at the winning bid, or Buy It Now, price posted to the auction item comment page.
If you won multiple items, please be sure to add them all to your cart at once and then check out so I can include them in your shipping estimate.
As a reminder:
I will only ship to the addresses within the United States.
I only accept PayPal and payment details will be sent alongside your final invoice.
Your item(s) will ship on the Saturday FOLLOWING verified payment. 
I will provide tracking information for your item and insurance sufficient to cover the final price of the auction on shipped items.
Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.
If you have any special requests, please Geekmail me so we can discuss prior to payment finalization.
Thank you for your purchase and I hope you enjoy your new game(s)!</notes>

    <notes>Buyer pays shipping
I bought the first edition and then got some kind of upgrade.  I counted everything based on the upgrade rulebook (there are two in the box, and it satisfied the one rulebook, which differed by 1 in whether there were 222 or 223 employee cards).  I have never played it, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hard for me to be more specific, but it certainly seems like everything is in there.</notes>
