   <description>Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the safe room _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    A cursed mask _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; this die is set aside when rolled._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    A golden mask _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    A red torch or blue key _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;discover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Treasures_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Curses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; module, some tiles _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;curse_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>International / Collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s edition, with foil box.
Includes Curses and Treasures, Promo 1 (The Pit), Promo 2 (Doomed), and The Hourglass.
There is some crush damage to one edge and two corners of the foil box. They have no effect on the structural integrity and I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice them until I audited it for sale here.
The game pieces are in new / very good condition, unmarked and undamaged, includes all the instruction sheets and hourglass and CD.
I counted every piece immediately before listing here.
We enjoyed it a couple times but it turns out we don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really like dice games. I would happily give this as a gift to a friend who doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind the corner thunks.
Buyer pays flat rate USPS priority mail (medium box) to any US address.</notes>

    <notes>This is the kickstarter edition with the gold foil box cover.  There is a sticker included (I did not put it on the box so it is in plastic) that says #107/1000 Collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition.  It includes the Illusions Expansion 1 box, and I removed the outer shrinkwrap of this box to include promo expansions #1 and #2.  The Illusions expansions and the promos are unpunched.  There is a minor 1/2 inch crease in the expansion box - it was shipped to me this way.  I punched the components for the base game, but it has never been played.  Comes from a smoke-free home.
*Added 7/23/15* -- I was cleaning out a closet and found a poster of this game that was sent to me for kickstarting the foil box.  It is in the cardboard-enforced envelope that it was sent to me in, and is in perfect condition.</notes>

    <notes>This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much. All of the game components (cards, counters, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game three times.  I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.

    <notes>$15.00 shipping US only...   game is like new and contains expansion modules and all original parts including CD.
Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;discover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.
The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.
Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.
Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Treasures_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Curses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; module, some tiles _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;curse_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to do while escaping a temple!</notes>

    <notes>**ANY GAME I HAVE LISTED IS STILL FOR SALE, NO MATTER WHEN I’VE LISTED IT**
This game has been demonstrated once*. It is in perfect condition.
It weighs 3 pounds and will be shipped via USPS, so you can check rates from 68108.
* For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demonstrated. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
Feel free to check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I charge actual shipping, so combining items will typically save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rated seller with over 4300 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well - check out my feedback! You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>
