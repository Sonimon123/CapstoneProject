   <description>Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Local group does not have time to play it so better to go to a good home than sit in my (limited space) cupboard.</notes>

This is an unplayed copy with the glass beads. However, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a ding and dent. The contents are mint and unplayed. It even has the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; smooth feel.
Buy it to play! I am culling the games collection.
Aussie pay by bank transfer, all others by paypal. Shipping is at cost.</notes>

Through the Ages is an exciting game of strategy and resource management. Players guide their civilizations up from Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and into Modern Times. 
What will your civilization be like? Will it be warlike?Technologically advanced? Religious? Artistic? Choose from Leaders such as Hammurabi, Napoleon, and Ghandi. Build the Pyramids, the Great Wall, or the Eiffel Tower. 
Your Civilization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s culture is yours to shape – and you can do it differently every time you play the game. 
Through the Ages is playable in three different difficulty levels. Play the short Tutorial Game to learn the game mechanics. Play the Advanced Game when you are ready to face the consequences of politics and corruption. And when you want an even greater challenge, play the Full Version of Through the Ages and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight.

    <notes>This is the 2008 FRED printing of Through the Ages (technically FRED_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s second printing of the game).  The game is in pristine collection, with 3 of the card decks still in shrink wrap!  
The reason I classify this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is due to two minor blemishes on the box (pictured to the best of my ability below).  One corner is slightly dinged, and there is a slight dent on the back of the box.  These blemishes do not affect the game components at all.  Feel free to geekmail me with any questions!</notes>

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 101053N)
Through the Ages is an exciting game of strategy and resource management. Players guide their civilizations up from Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and into Modern Times. 
What will your civilization be like? Will it be warlike?Technologically advanced? Religious? Artistic? Choose from Leaders such as Hammurabi, Napoleon, and Ghandi. Build the Pyramids, the Great Wall, or the Eiffel Tower. 
Your Civilization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s culture is yours to shape – and you can do it differently every time you play the game. 
Through the Ages is playable in three different difficulty levels. Play the short Tutorial Game to learn the game mechanics. Play the Advanced Game when you are ready to face the consequences of politics and corruption. And when you want an even greater challenge, play the Full Version of Through the Ages and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight.

Ideally, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d get the plastic cubes (around $12) and then you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d need to print out a main game board.

Language: English
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 12+
Duration: about 120 min
Weight: 1.580 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Through the Ages is a civilization building game. The goal is to develop your civilization, not to destroy other ones. Military strength is just one aspect of your nation, as well as population, production or science. It is up to you which aspect you will concentrate on, more or less, but you should not underestimate any of them while building your civilization. Victory is achieved by the player whose nation produces the most culture during the game. However, there are many ways to produce culture: through religion, literature or drama, by building wonders, by utilizing cultural persons etc. Considerable amount of culture can be gained even via wars or aggression.

Your Civilization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s culture is yours to shape - and you can do it differently every time you play the game. 
Through the Ages is playable in three different difficulty levels. Play the short Tutorial Game to learn the game mechanics. Play the Advanced Game when you are ready to face the consequences of politics and corruption. And when you want an even greater challenge, play the Full Version of Through the Ages and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight.</notes>

Language: English
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 12+
Duration: about 120 min
Weight: 1.580 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Through the Ages is a civilization building game. The goal is to develop your civilization, not to destroy other ones. Military strength is just one aspect of your nation, as well as population, production or science. It is up to you which aspect you will concentrate on, more or less, but you should not underestimate any of them while building your civilization. Victory is achieved by the player whose nation produces the most culture during the game. However, there are many ways to produce culture: through religion, literature or drama, by building wonders, by utilizing cultural persons etc. Considerable amount of culture can be gained even via wars or aggression.

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101131N)
Through the Ages is an exciting game of strategy and resource management. Players guide their civilizations up from Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and into Modern Times. Will your civilization be warlike? Technologically advanced? Religious? Artistic? Choose from leaders such as Hammurabi, Napoleon and Gandhi. Build the Pyramids, the Great Wall, or the Eiffel Tower. Your civilization’s culture is yours to shape - differently each time you play the game. You may play the short Tutorial Game to learn the game mechanics in an hour orless. Play the Advanced Game when you are ready to face the consequences of politics and corruption. And when you are ready for an even greater challenge, play the Full Version and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight! </notes>

    <notes>Played once. Like new.
It came with fewer little wooden counters than the rules indicated. This seems to be a factory problem, and you could contact the manufacturer about it. As is, it is completely fine for 2 or 3 players. In some games, 4 might need to proxy a few tokens in the late game.

Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately. 
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost. I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.

    <notes>This is the third printing of Through the Ages.
I am selling this game in order to make room on my shelves for games that might get played more often.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m assigning this game a condition of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because the box is slightly banged up.  However, the damage is very minor, and the components are all very well cared for.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added a good bit of value, too!  Read on for more.
Condition
---
The box has some minor shelf wear on the edges.  Most significantly, one of corners of the bottom part of the box has begun to tear, but it has been arrested/repaired with a small piece of clear packing tape.  If not for this tear, I would rate this item in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.
I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember if this game came with an insert, but if it did, it isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t present now.  It was discarded to make room for the extras (see below).
Components
---
All game components and manuals are present and in perfectly pristine condition.  Furthermore, the following extras are included:
-A plano box holding all of the wooden pieces.
-Cards protected in Mayday premium sleeves.
-Cards sorted and bound into decks using non-adhesive Amazing Tape.
Shipping
---
I will ship this via USPS in a flat rate box (I think it will fit), to the USA only for $15.  If you are outside of the US and really want this game, feel free to drop me a GM, and we can discuss it.  I only hesitate because I rarely ship out of the country.
Closing Thoughts
---
This is the first item I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ever sold on BGG, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold some 15-ish things on eBay, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m at least not a total noob with this sort of thing.  I generally treasure my games, but I need to clear some space, and I just can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t justify keeping this one around now that we have Eclipse and will pretty much never play TtA again.</notes>

    <notes>Fred games 3rd edition/printing.
Game is in great condition having only been played a couple of times, just sadly don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to devote to this one.
Postage in the UK will be £8.00- it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a heavy game! International buyers please feel free to ask me for a price.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101131N)
Through the Ages is an exciting game of strategy and resource management. Players guide their civilizations up from Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and into Modern Times. Will your civilization be warlike? Technologically advanced? Religious? Artistic? Choose from leaders such as Hammurabi, Napoleon and Gandhi. Build the Pyramids, the Great Wall, or the Eiffel Tower. Your civilization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s culture is yours to shape - differently each time you play the game. You may play the short Tutorial Game to learn the game mechanics in an hour or less. Play the Advanced Game when you are ready to face the consequences of politics and corruption. And when you are ready for an even greater challenge, play the Full Version and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight! </notes>

The game was only played a couple of times and all of the components are in great shape. The box itself has some minor shelf wear on the edges and corners but is in great shape otherwise.  Pictures will be provided if requested.

    <notes>Even though I set the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, I may as well say it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
It is not in shrink, but other than that it has been untouched. The cards inside are still in shrink-wrap and the tokens in their never opened original baggies.
Rules just seemed a little too much too handle and too long of a game for my friends to get into it, so I decided to sell it.
It is a great game though! :) I played it in a gaming event and got so excited ended up buying it.
Impulse buy, time to let it go haha.
It is the 2009, Third Edition (I believe it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the most recent English edition).
I live in Atlanta, GA if you want to calculate shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games / CBG / FRED English 1st edition, only played once, pristine condition with only minor shelf wear.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>2nd edition, 3rd printing from 2009. I only played it two times, so the the components are in excellent condition. The rulebook has a very minor bit of wear (ever so slight creasing from being flipped through) and the box has a barely noticeable dent in the upper right corner. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a bit of a perfectionist about game condition. These are  extremely minor.

And when you are ready for an even greater challenge, play the Full Version and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight!</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101053N)
Through the Ages is an exciting game of strategy and resource management. Players guide their civilizations up from Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and into Modern Times. Will your civilization be warlike? Technologically advanced? Religious? Artistic? Choose from leaders such as Hammurabi, Napoleon and Gandhi. Build the Pyramids, the Great Wall, or the Eiffel Tower. Your civilization_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s culture is yours to shape - differently each time you play the game. You may play the short Tutorial Game to learn the game mechanics in an hour or less. Play the Advanced Game when you are ready to face the consequences of politics and corruption. And when you are ready for an even greater challenge, play the Full Version and take your civilization from spear-throwing to space flight!</notes>

    <notes>This is a great game that I played 2 player with my wife but she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bored with beating me now ;-). All of the game components (cards, counters, rules, player aids, box etc) are in really good condition.  I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.
I have checked it out and to the best of my knowledge this version is Second Edition 2nd printing.

    <notes>Heads up! There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a new version of this game available. Actually, the only reason I am selling this is because I want to put the money towards the new version. But, maybe you are hoping to score a deal on this excellent game instead of paying $60 for a new copy...
My copy of the game is in great shape, components and box both. I have the upgraded tokens, semi-translucent cubes, which are way better then the tiny cylinders that roll all over (though they are in the box as well).
This is one of my all-time favorite games, and this copy has basked in some epic game nights.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll fit in a medium flat rate box, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll use USPS Priority if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cheaper; and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in Maine, near Brunswick, local pickup is always welcome.

Also includes a set of 5 plastic player board overlays to help maintain all of the wooden tokens on a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s board - to keep them from rolling and moving around; a great addition to this listing.   The box does have some rubbing, marking and white corners with the box bottom edge worn a bit.  This is a great copy for playing as I just never got it to the table.  Box is the reason this is not rated _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Buyer to pay priority mail shipping and pay pal fee.</notes>

    <notes>FOR AUCTION WINNER LENTINI 007 ONLY.
This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Third Printing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of the Eagle-Gryphon edition (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;English third edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the BGG versions page), with all the errata fixed.
Complete, excellent condition.
This copy has been pimped out with a very nice custom-made insert (foam core and hot glue?) and 4 truly high quality, full-color, fan-made alternate player boards that _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;do_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; more than the boards in the game.
