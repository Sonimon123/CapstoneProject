   <description>Wings of War: Watch Your Back! is the second title in the WoW line and is again set in World War I._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game can be played by itself or mixed with Wings of War: Famous Aces for larger scenarios. It includes 5 models of planes: the Nieuport 11, Hanriot HD.1 and Halberstadt D.III fighters, together with the British/American DH4 and the Austrian Ufag C.I two-seaters. There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card for the first set depicting an American SPAD XIII._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rulebook is the same as Wings of War: Famous Aces and it lists scenarios for each of the two boxes, plus a couple for players who own both of them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;18 airplane cards are for immediate use. A curious plane, useful for more variated scenarios, is the Nieuport 11 of the German Jasta 1, flown in action by Leutnant Gustav Leffers. In the box there are also a few weapon variants for owners of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Famous aces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;: Scaroni's and Fucini's HD.1 with twin machineguns instead of the single one that was the standard from the factory; a British DH4 with a twin machinegun in the rear arc; a DH4 of the American Expeditionary Force with twin machineguns both on the forward and on the rear arc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Dutch version of Wings of War. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in shrink wrap. But I think except for the rules, the game is language independent.
I have 2 Paypal accounts. Without creditcard it will be free. But if you prefer to pay with creditcard I will include those extra cost in the final price.
Game weight is 568 grams

Roaring two-seater planes fly over the trenches on recon missions, bombing runs, trench strafing, and daring rescues... Can you escort your planes to their targets and safely back home? Or can you prevent your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s planes from striking at the heart of your forces?
Watch Your Back! can be played by itself or mixed with Famous Aces to play larger scenarios. It includes five types of planes: the Nieuport 11, Hanriot HD.1 and Halberstadt D.III fighters, and the British/American DH4 and the Austrian Ufag C.I two-seaters.</notes>

    <notes>My late husband was an avid board game collector.  It is time for the games to find new homes, hopefully to someone who enjoys them as much as he did.  All his games are in excellent condition, he took very good care of them.   If he did play the games, no eating or drinking was allowed.  
Please feel free to ask any questions.   Thank you!</notes>
