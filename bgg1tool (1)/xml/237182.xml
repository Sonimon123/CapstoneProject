   <description>Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Meanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;description from the publisher_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Includes:

This is a pre-order. Root is scheduled to be delivered in August 2018. 
Payment for the game will be expected now with an additional payment for shipping as soon as it is delivered. I will do my best to ship this as economically as possible and will work with you to use whichever carrier you prefer.
I will be happy to ship outside of the US, but know that the price for shipping internationally can be expensive. Again, I will do everything I can to ship this as economically as possible.</notes>

    <notes>Played twice. Excellent condition except for some minor dings on a player board (the vagabond board) that were present when I received the game new from Leder Games (I will package it much better than they did when I ship it). If not for that unfortunate ding, I would have listed the game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I prefer to be as forthcoming as possible about game conditions.
Includes the Riverfolk expansion (but not the cheap expansion insert). 
The base game insert is included.</notes>

One of the dents was large enough that it dented the boards within the base box (only a little bit). There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no splits or other structural damage to the box/components. Everything is functional/lays flat. Components are otherwise in shrink (e.g., the cards) or unpunched (e.g., counters).

The game has been played only once. All components are present and in excellent condition. (Have described as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; rather than _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; only because I have already punched all boards etc.)
This game has only ever been stored (and only play also took place) in a smokefree environment.</notes>

    <notes>Only played once and includes my own bags for pieces. Excellent condition. Not enough time to get it to the table. There is a small ruffle on the right top side of the box about 1 inch long but it blends into the box really well and is hardly noticeable. Comes from a smoke free pet free home.

    <notes>Played a few of times. The two vizier cards had some slight damage (see picture) in the bottom corner when the game was opened. 
I have contacted Leder Games and they have committed to shipping replacements in the New Year. I will forward these when they are received but I cannot guarantee this of course as it is out of my hands. Please only purchase on this understanding. All the cards are sleeved so the impact is negligible as can be seen in the picture but I always ensure complete transparency in any sales. 
Shipping will be £6 in the U.K. using collect plus economy with insurance. Collection from Lichfield in Staffordshire is free.
I currently have the Riverfolk Expansion for sale too and would listen to offers for both if the expansion is still available at the time of purchase. For European shipping please contact me first.
Payment by PayPal gift or bank transfer please.</notes>

    <notes>Purchased Root and loved it but my gaming circle has copies we use instead.
The condition of the game is excellent - box wear, cards, etc. Only the rulebooks are slightly wrinkled from passing it from player to player during our first play. This copy has only been played three times. 
Shipping will be through USPS priority flat rate or regular shipping if cheaper, sent from Portland Maine USA. Thank you for looking!</notes>

    <notes>THIS IS PRICED SO HIGH BECAUSE IT INCLUDES THE EXPANSION; IM SELLING THEM TOGETHER
Opened the base game, played through 1 time. We took the shrinkwrap off the expansion to look inside, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s as far as we got. Cards still shrink-wrapped, etc.
I have too many games, and I know with the groups I have to game with, this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t going to go over well... So no sense in holding on to it.</notes>
