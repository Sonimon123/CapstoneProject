Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;leading to immense variety._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Dominion series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Dominion: Intrigue_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Age of players: 10++
Length: 30 minutes
Game Description: 
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!  In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.

    <notes>In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be proud, but your grandparents would be delighted.
Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes complete with roughly 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play -- leading to immense variety.</notes>

    <notes>RIO Grande Games (RIO 370)
Game Description:
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.
We have created an insert for you to place down the center of your box to make it easier to organize and find the cards in your game.

    <notes>In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be proud, but your grandparents would be delighted.
Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes complete with roughly 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play -- leading to immense variety.

    <notes>RIO Grande Games (RIO 370)
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.
We have created an insert for you to place down the center of your box to make it easier to organize and find the cards in your game. </notes>

Length: 30 minutes
Game Description: 
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!  In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.</notes>

    <notes>My copy is definitely like new.  The cards have been touched a few times, but we never managed to play the game.  Just not our cup of tea.  Basically the only thing missing is the shrink wrap.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to anywhere in the US, accept PayPal and will consider trades/other offers.
Let me know a zip code and I can do an estimate of shipping costs.
To cut down on the possibility of scams (all too common I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m afraid), I will issue a paypal invoice for all transactions and will wait a few (no more than business 3 days) prior to shipping for payment to clear.  So you will need a verified Paypal account, and make sure the shipping address is correct on it.
If there are special cases, just let me know and we can see about working something out!</notes>

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!  In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.</notes>

    <notes>99% of the game is like new. Looks like it was played once, but during that game there was a spill. One Village card is warped enough to be unusable-- all the blank cards are like new, so if this was my copy, I would use a blank card as my 10th village. 
Additionally, the blue-backed selector card for Village is recognizable from the back, due to a crease. It will work fine for randomly selecting cards for your game, but if you are playing with Black Market it will be recognizable. If I was playing with this copy, I would use a blue-backed card of one of the treasures to represent the Village.
A few other cards were sticky when I got this, but I easily cleaned them off, they are just fine now.
All other cards, rules, and the insert are Like New.
The box top, sides, and corners are all Like New. The bottom has a puncture you can almost put your little finger through, and another big crease.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re fine with the box bottom and these workarounds for the Village, you can get a good bargain here.
Shipping to be paid by buyer. The $10.50 priority mail flat rate will probably be the cheapest, unless you live close to Washington State, in which case we might be able to find cheaper.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 370)
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.</notes>

    <notes>This is Dominion and the expansions, Intrigue, Prosperity, Seaside, Alchemy and Cornucopia, along with BGG promo cards blanks/stash; blackmarket and envoy; and walled village.  Some of the games have been played, but the cards and box have very little, if any wear.
Everything is well organized in the base Dominion box in three hand made trays and cards to identify where each card is stored.  (insert is gone, see pictures) and this would be the only box provided.
Because this package is so heavy, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only shipping this one to the United States.  Options are Medium Flat Rate at $10.95 or Large Flat Rate at $14.95 if you want more padding around the game.  Either way, your postal person will TP your house on Halloween...

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.</notes>

    <notes>Includes the following :
     Dominion (Base Game)
     Intrigue
     Alchemy
     Seaside
     Envoy / Black Market / Stash / Blank Promo cards
All cards are sleeved _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; are in excellent condition. The game is stored in the single base game box (the expansion boxes have been thrown out). Sleeves will be included in the sale (they probably cost more than the game itself).
Due to the weight of the box, I am offering pickup only in Blacktown, NSW. Cash payment on pickup.
Happy to answer any questions you have.

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. 
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn’t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO370)
 You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted. </notes>

Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $6.50. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.

-Dominion base game
-Seaside
-Intrigue
-Prosperity
-Promos: Envoy and blackmarket.
-completely sleeved with Mayday euro premium sleeves
Everything above is somewhere around $140. 
All cards and extras are included.  Everything was made to fit in the base game box (I made foam board dividers for the rows, as well as card dividers per type for easy setting up and tearing down).  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the expansion boxes.  Cards are all in mint because they have been played in the sleeves, which show minimal to no wear in some cases.  ALL rulebooks are included.

Intrigue
Alchemy
Seaside
Prosperity
Cornucopia
Hinterlands
Also includes all 4 promos.
All game materials, tokens, bits, rules sheets, etc are present in excellent condition.
DOES NOT include game boxes.  All cards are stored in a white 4-column card storage box (with printed dividers for each card set).  Each set is listing for $20 used on the BGG marketplace, I am selling the whole thing at a discounted $15 per game since the boxes are not available.
Re: shipping - I cannot give an exact amount for shipping until I know what zip code I am shipping to.  I will get the best price possible, but please be aware that this is essentially 7 card games in one box.  Not counting any packaging materials, etc., the box weighs 12.5 pounds!  That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a lot of game!  FedEx HD will probably run in the $16-$20 range.  I *will* keep shipping at or below $20.</notes>

The more games you buy though, the less it makes a difference and I will combine shipping happily.

    <notes>This is it- you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to get into Dominion in one fell swoop, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m looking to sell my entire set. This sale is for the Dominion base game, Intrigue, Seaside, Alchemy, Propserity, and Cornucopia. This is everything that is currently available except for Hinterlands and Dark Ages. All cards are in excellent condition, many never before played. Alchemy may as well be in shrink- I opened it and never used it.
The only catch is that Prosperity and Intrigue DO NOT have the original boxes. Those sets are in CCG-style long boxes, carefully tabbed for organization. Honestly, I wish the whole set were organized like those. I do still have the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;menus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from the original boxes as well as all rulebooks and other components. Everything else is in original boxes, 100% complete.
Shipping this lot may be a little on the expensive side due to weight, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll work with you to a)make sure you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re charged strictly for the shipping- no overage or spread and b) that we ship what is best for you in terms of speed and cost. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m thinking the ballpark of $15-$20 sounds about right.
Let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO370)
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted. </notes>

Standard Information listed on all my For Sale Games:
------------------------------------------------------
1) Shipping cost is the highest cost of all games purchased + the add on cost of each other game. Promo cards or anything else that fits in a bubble mailer will have a base cost of $5 and and an add on cost of $1, a small game has a base cost of $8 and an add on cost of $2, a medium game has a base cost of $14 and an add on cost of $3 and a large game has a base cost of $20 and add on cost of $4. Anything outside that range will be listed specifically. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re providing a business address to ship to, take a $1 off the shipping. 
2) Purchase a $100 or more worth of games and get 5% off your total order.
3) Purchase $200 or more and get 5% off and free shipping.
4) If you see any games on my for trade list that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t up for sale, feel free to ask me to add to the market.
5) Most conditions are listed as very good, all those items listed as such range from very good to like new. 
6) Amazon and game store gift cards are usually accepted but please check with me first if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an option you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pursue.
7) I try to list editions but if an edition isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t listed and it matters to you, please ask! If an item is bought and another edition was expected but you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask, then I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to refund but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t cover either shipping charge.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO370)
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted. </notes>

    <notes>NOTE:  THIS OFFER FOR USER userid122002 ONLY!  THANK YOU.
Most cards are in very good condition.  I am selling both this and Dominion: Intrigue in case you want to save on shipping by purchasing both.  In the base set, the Treasure cards are showing wear around the edges, but they can be replaced with the Treasure cards in Intrigue if you purchase both sets...those are unused.  None of them are damaged...just the black border is beginning to wear away on some of the Treasure cards.  The base game box has shelf wear in all four corners.  I can send you pics if you like.  Otherwise, the condition of both sets are very good.</notes>

    <notes>First edition, played 2-3 times, always sleeved (but sleeves not included, unfortunately).  Cards in perfect condition.
Box has some shelf wear on corners, and the insert has some dents.  Instructions were folded long-ways at one point, but generally lay flat.
I have listed Intrigue, Seaside, Alchemy, Prosperity as well, and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to combine to save on shipping (potentially even ditching the boxes to go with ccg card boxes, as I did when I had them on the shelves), let me know.
Shipping will be exact cost +$0.75 (for shipping materials), even internationally.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>The is for dominion base, prosperity, intrigue, alchemy, seaside, and dark ages. This also has stash, envoy, and black market. 90% of the cards are sleeved with penny sleeves. Some of the money is not because one never uses all the money from both intrigue and base.
The whole set comes in an extremely large wooden case.  Shipping would be ridiculous. So either be ready for expensive shipping or local pickup. I could remove them from the box and put them into something else, like the artist case, for example, but that is on you to pay for. Though I do have the separators for it.</notes>

Played heavily, the box shows shelf send travel wear. 98% of cards are sleeved (only some of the money cards which were extra, and a few frequently unused cards which we never played with).
Loved the game but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to move on.
I have Seaside, Prosperity, Cornicopia, Intrigue, the Black Market promo card included. All have boxes, manuals, and are 98% sleeved with clear sleeves.
Note that these cards are missing: The Witch, Young Witch, and Torturer.
This entire set is a good, clean, play set. Enjoy!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO370)
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be proud, but your grandparents, would be delighted. </notes>

Will include some extra sleeves in the box so you can sleeve more of them yourself if desired.
Box has some minor shelf wear in the corners. One corner of the lid is split.

    <notes>This is for a collection of Dominion, not just the base game.
Only the base set has been played with a few times. Intrigue and Seaside a couple of times. About 80% of the cards are in penny sleeves. The last couple of expansions are not. This is all the major expansions to date, minus Empires. I do not have the original boxes. I moved the cards to three plastic compartmentalized boxes (the kind that are used for nuts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; bolts). Comes with all original instruction manuals.

    <notes>The Classic/original deck building game. I really enjoy this game but unfortunately rarely get it to the table anymore, and with a baby due in a couple of months I need to free up some space.
One or two of the cards are slightly scuffed but the majority of them are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. I have baggied up all of the cards so they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get shuffled and damaged during transit.
Shipping within UK only. I *think* this should be within the weight limit for a small package, so would cost £2.80 for 2nd class but I will confirm.</notes>

    <notes>This is a negotiated price for Matt Poole @BoardGamePictures (Peterslax2).
This lot is for the first 8 Dominion games published. These are the 2009-2012 editions. 
Base, Intrigue, Seaside, Alchemy, Prosperity, Cornucopia, Hinterlands, Dark Ages
Most cards are lightly used and in pretty good shape. Dark Ages is unplayed. Coppers show slight wear with darkening on the edges when looked at as a group, but they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bent or anything (see pic).  Sets are complete -- all cards, rules (a couple have a small stain on them), tokens and mats are included. I even have all the boxes and inserts should you decide you want it all.
I started making simple dividers for the cards. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to print out all the labels and include them, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to continue with that method and place the stickers on the index cards cut in half. There are nicer labels available in the BGG files, depending on your storage and aesthetic needs. As shown, about a third of the dividers are complete. 
PICTURES: 
labels, player mats and tokens, cards in two boxes, all boxes, dividers, sample of coppers and silvers

SHIPPING OPTIONS:
MOST ECONOMICAL:  If I wrap the sets of cards in saran wrap, the square inches suggest they should fit into one medium priority mail box. I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tried this option yet, but if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re sure this is what you want, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to ship them this way, especially if you have other storage ideas in mind. This option doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include any boxes or inserts
ECONOMICAL: All kingdom cards fit into one of the larger boxes, but the randomizer cards, rules, tokens and mats would have to be stored separately. This box will be very heavy at approximately 12 lbs. The box is just shy of 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, so the box plus other items should fit into a large flat rate box, which is 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 5-1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. There will be minimal room for packing materials around the outside of the box. This would include one large game box of your choice and no insert.
REASONABLE: Everything except the rules fit into the smaller Alchemy and Cornucopia boxes.  Unfortunately, these two boxes are just a little too large to fit into any of the flat rate priority boxes. These boxes will also be fairly heavy at about 5.5 and 6.5 lbs. Shipping is pretty comparable whether you look at two medium flat rate boxes or one box weighing about 13 lbs. I looked into regional rate boxes, but it still works out to two of those, although the shipping may be slightly less.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have to wait for the Post Office to deliver those boxes, if you select that option. This option includes the Alchemy and Cornucopia boxes and no inserts.
THE WHOLE HOG: I have all the boxes, which are in excellent to acceptable condition, although I doubt you want to pay for shipping all those boxes. If you do, this option includes all boxes and all inserts.</notes>

    <notes>Dominion, Intrigue, Cornucopia, and Seaside. All combined and packaged in one Cornucopia box (see image). This sleeving system is awesome - you just pull 10 packs of cards and start the game. End of game you put each card set in one sleeve (10 cards in one sleeve) and the game is cleaned up. Very easy to set up, randomize, and put away. All cards in excellent condition, all additional victory point pieces, mats, etc. included.
Buyer pays shipping - estimated $12.85.</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is my copy of Dominion, Dominion Intrigue, and Dominion Seaside. I am down sizing my game collection and this game did not make the cut. It is a fun game but just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see the table as much as I would like for my game group and I would rather have someone else enjoy it than for it to just sit on my shelf. This game is in excellent condition as I take pride in caring for my games. Played maybe 4-5 times and it is roughly 75% un-played as there are so many card combinations. All my games come from a smoke free home. 
Included in this sale is the following:
Dominion
Dominion: Intrigue
Dominion: Seaside
Broken Token Game Organizer

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams. You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion. In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury, all the while preventing competing monarchs from infringing on your rightful domain.</notes>
