   <description>In Z_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Egrave;RTZ, the third addition to the GIPF Project, players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is part of project GIPF._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I prefer to ship via UPS for tracking reasons, so shipping will vary depending on the destination. The package will be well packed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting this for sale a little low because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to reduce my collection in prepration for my move. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting more games soon, so keep a eye out for those as well.

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition.  It has been played several times, but the box shows no wear.  I am selling my entire collection of Gipf so if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, please look in the other Gipf games for the entire collection minus Yinsh.
All games are in excellent condition being in slightly played status.  If you have any questions feel free to ask!
If you are interested in purchasing multiple games, or the entire collection let me know and I will combine shipping for all games.

Box: Light shelf-wear only - close to like new!
Components: Complete and in like new condition! As appropriate, the pieces have been seperated and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged. In addition, you will receive 3 sets of Potentials (three black pieces and three white pieces) for Zertz that allows further gameplay in conjunction with the Gipf series (which includes games such as Gipf, Tamsk, Punct and others).
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Smart Games - ZERTZ
Language: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Spanish 
Players: 2
Age: 8+
Duration: about 15 min 
Weight: 0.880 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In this third addition to the GIPF Project players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.

    <notes>Game is complete and in like-new condition.
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes!  When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive.  To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete, includes 10 black marbles, 8 gray marbles, 6 white marbles, 37 rings, 3 white potentials, 3 black potentials, instructions. Box shows a fair amount of shelf wear, one split corner, some small dents and dings, and some slight creasing and dishing on the lid. The components, which are rather durable, show little to no wear.
Shipping cost will be my actual cost to ship from 95008. Local pickup in San Jose, CA, is available as well.
