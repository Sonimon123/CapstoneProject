   <description>Xia: Legends of a Drift System is a 3-5 player sandbox style competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players fly their ships about the system, completing a variety of missions, exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and most importantly Fame._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The most adaptive, risk taking, and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Customize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Adapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play, players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Modding: Xia is very opened to modding, and the community created loads of stuff. See BGG's Unofficial Xia:LoaDS mods and expansions wiki._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

*** Payment:
Within Euro-zone the EU-standard-bank-transfer (SEPA, IBAN/BIC) is recommended, 
it´s quick, save and causes no fees. 
Paypal is certainly also possible, fees within EU are 0,35 Euro + 1,9% of the total.
Worldwide (outside the EURO-zone) Paypal is recommended.
Paypal -fees are 0,35 Euro + (3,9% - 5,2%) of the total.
For nearly all countries outside Europe, apart from USA and Canada (both 3,9%), the rate is 5.2%.
The fees of the payment method you choose and the real shipping costs you have to pay.
Thank you. Stephan.</notes>

    <notes>This game is brand-new, still in the shrinkwrap. It is the kickstarter edition.  It looks beautiful, but I moved recently  after the kickstarter but before the game arrived and no longer have a gaming group to play this with. Buyer is responsible for shipping up to $15 (the game is very big and won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship in any standard flat rate box).   I ship all of my games within two business days of receiving a payment. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter edition of Xia, complete with Sellsword and any other extras it came with. I have opened the box and most of the plastic bags, but never played the game. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it because my friend also bought it, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played his a few times - we have no need of two copies!
The only blemish, is I did carry the rulebook around in my bag for a bit and it got a little bent / etc. Everything else is exactly how it arrived to me, and looks good from what I can tell!
I am only asking for exactly what I paid ($100) plus $15 towards shipping in the US, as this is a Big box! PM me, as I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see this deal lasting for long since it is lower than all the others listed here or on ebay :)</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter edition without Sellsword ship, played only once. 
One flight stand was broken out of the box, but I glued it back together seems to hold well and is not noticable. 
As a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;compensation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; there was a second mini of one ship in the box (need to check which one it is).</notes>

All components in bags (except cards and money so they fit in the plastic tray). Few cards might show some very slight white edges which is typical with black bordered cards. All other components are like new.

    <notes>Xia: Legends of a Drift System is a 3-5 player sandbox style competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship.
Players fly their ships about the system, completing a variety of missions, exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and most importantly Fame.
The most adaptive, risk taking, and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!</notes>
