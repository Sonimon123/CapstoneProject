   <description>Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer Christian T. Petersen has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from 'Puerto Rico' to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of 'Settlers of Catan', while the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of 'Attack' to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Twilight Imperium (Second Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shattered Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Twilight Imperium (Third Edition): Shards of the Throne_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I generally ship on the Friday or Saturday after receipt of payment. UPS or USPS available. I will ship overseas, but since this a very heavy game, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably not worth it for the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>Still new and in original shrinkwrap.
Domestic US shipping will be through UPS ground, at actual cost. This is a HUGE box, just under 11 lbs even with tight packaging (actual game weighs about 9.5 lbs, 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), so cross-country shipping could be as high as $15. Let me know your zip code and I will reply with shipping charges. 
I assume shipping will get prohibitive overseas by anything but surface mail, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send it airmail if you wish. </notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG TI03)
TWILIGHT IMPERIUM 3RD EDITION
TI3 is an epic empire-building game of intersteller conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to sieze the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. TI3 features new oversize geomorphic board tiles, finely detailed plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and a massive plurality of options.
This new giant-size edition of TI features more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures -- the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for TI, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full color rules set.
The TI gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience with much less downtime. In addition, TI3 will include the new ‘Race Cards’, as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new ‘Command’ system.

    <notes>*RESERVED FOR USER crash07*
*Includes both the base game and the Shattered Empire expansion*
(Price if for the base game and expansion combined)
This doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the base game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original box.  Instead, the game and expansion are both inside the expansion box plus an extra unrelated box (from the Lord of the Rings: Friends and Foes).  On the positive side, this means the game takes up only half the space of the original game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be able to ship it using a (large) flat rate box, at least within the US.
Both box tops have a slight outward bow.  The rules, plastic pieces, cardboard tokens, cards, and map tiles are in very good condition.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

I will ship via any method the buyer chooses, just let me know.  Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game is actually in very good condition with the exception of very slight damage to one of the corners of the box lid.  The only problem is that it is missing two pieces.  1 Command Token is missing from The Naalu Collective (the dog, quite literally, ate it) and 1 purple Destroyer is missing (it was missing when I bought the game).  Other than these omissions the other pieces are all present and accounted for and in very good condition, including the box insert and very tight fitting card box.
The missing Command Token is easily proxied for by using one from 1 of the (minimum) 4 races not currently being played.  The missing destroyer is harder to replace (unless playing with fewer than 6 players) but a piece from another game could certainly be used as a proxy and it might be possible to obtain replacements from FFG anyway, I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tried.
P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P within the UK will be £8.00 by courier.
Due to the excessive weight of this item the postage costs to ship outside of the UK are far too prohibitive so I will only ship it within the UK.</notes>

Außerdem gibt es 5 Spielhilfen auf Deutsch, jeweils im Schnellhefter circa 10 Übersichtsblätter oder Kartenübersetzungen hier aus dem Forum zusammengestellt.

    <notes>Complete, box has some light scuffing from shelf wear, and the rules have some wear (but no rips/tears).  The rest is mint/near mint.  Only 3 colors have been removed from the sprues.  Cards, tokens, and tiles are bagged nicely and look like new.
Will ship anywhere, but international bidders beware that shipping with tracking is at least $40 and probably more. Buyer pays full shipping cost. All of my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games are for sale as well, so if some of those interest, let me know and we will negotiate a price.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a copy of Twilight Imperium 3rd edition with the expansion Shattered Empires. The condition is listed as good as the the Shattered Empires expansion is inside the 3rd edition box of Twilight Imperium (meaning I do not have the Shattered Empires box). As well, the Twilight Imperium box shows shelf wear and a couple of the corners are ripped.
The components are immaculate. The Shattered Empires components are still in the shrink wrap. The Twilight Imperium components are in mint condition as they have been out of the box once. The game comes from a pet and smoke free home.
I will ship world wide but the buyer is responsible for all costs. Keep in mind this is a heavy and large game.
Also, I will accept paypal, check, or money order but the funds must clear before I will ship.
For any questions and/or pictures please message me.
Thank you.</notes>

Overall condition like new.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve done a COMPLETE inventory.  One race is missing 2 supply tokens, and one blank artifact is missing.  These do not affect gameplay and can be worked around easily.  All other pieces are accounted for.  You can probably get the parts from FFG or another BGG user but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never bothered to do that.  The base game and Shattered Empire have been played 2-3 times.  Shards is unplayed.
There are no boxes for the expansions - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all packed into the main game box.
It will be best to ship this package UPS.  Buyer will pay approximately $15-25 for insured shipping depending on how far you are from me (Indiana).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take paypal or USPS money orders.</notes>

    <notes>Included with this game is the entire Shattered Empire expansion! The only thing missing is the separate Shattered Empire box. All the pieces and rules for the base game and the expansion are present, neatly packed into the box of the base game in plastic bags or small plastic boxes.
The box is worn around the edges, but is still holding together well (with the help of some tape and TLC). Also, a few of the system tiles are slightly worn. Otherwise everything is in great condition.
Note: This edition of Shattered Empire was subject to a printing error. The orange Technology deck is missing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Transit Diodes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card and has an extra copy of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sarween Tools_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card instead. This error never significantly affected any of the games I played.    </notes>

Shipping in a massive (12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) epic-size box, this new giant-size edition of  Twilight Imperium features more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures - the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for Twilight Imperium, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full-color rules set.
The Twilight Imperium gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience, with much less downtime. In addition, TI3 will include the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Race Cards,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; system.
Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition is nothing short of a massive epic release, and is destined to become a classic for years to come. FFG has directed all its craft, talent, and energy into this massive production. Are you ready for another age of Twilight? </notes>

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).
A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

Shipping in a massive (12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) epic-size box, this new giant-size edition of Twilight Imperium features more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures - the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for Twilight Imperium, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full-color rules set. The Twilight Imperium gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience, with much less downtime. In addition, TI3 will include the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Race Cards,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; system. Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition is nothing short of a massive epic release, and is destined to become a classic for years to come.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGTI03)
Shipping in a massive (12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) epic-size box, this new giant-size edition of Twilight Imperium features more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures - the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for Twilight Imperium, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full-color rules set. The Twilight Imperium gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience, with much less downtime. In addition, TI3 will include the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Race Cards,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; system. Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition is nothing short of a massive epic release, and is destined to become a classic for years to come. FFG has directed all its craft, talent, and energy into this massive production. Are you ready for another age of Twilight? </notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m starting to think that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never get this to the table, so onto the marketplace it goes.  Perhaps it can fund a copy of Descent, or something more appropriate for my typical gaming group of 2.
The base game has been used thrice for solo tutorial games, where all pieces were loved and cared for.  The expansion was purchased used, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s components are in great shape.
Everything is stored in the large base-box, which shows some wear from being stored on the shelf.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big heavy box, USPS shipping may be close to $18.  Or, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re near Mid-Coast Maine, we can meet and skip the shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Game/pieces/cards have been opened but never played, 100% complete.  If you buy this you must also buy Shattered Empire from me (please do it in the same transaction, it is easier that way).  Very minor shelf wear on box corners, otherwise perfect condition.  It is missing one yellow space dock miniature (it came that way: I understand you can contact FFG for a free replacement, I just never got around to doing so).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 60oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

Shipping in a massive (12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) epic-size box, this new giant-size edition of Twilight Imperium features more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures - the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for Twilight Imperium, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full-color rules set. The Twilight Imperium gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience, with much less downtime. In addition, TI3 will include the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Race Cards,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; system. Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition is nothing short of a massive epic release, and is destined to become a classic for years to come. FFG has directed all its craft, talent, and energy into this massive production. Are you ready for another age of Twilight? </notes>

    <notes>Super awesome collection that has been played very little. Contains both expansions, pimped box interior for sorting tiles. Everything is bagged. Custom cases for fleet pieces. I have the original boxes for the expansions as well if you want them but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not interested in separating the expansions out. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all or nothing.
This is a heavy coffin box game so expect the shipping to be fairly pricy. Coolstuffinc would charge 140.00 for this collection new but you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get the individual fleet containers or customized tile box I created. Everything from both expansions fits logically in the base box. I hate to let it go, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just too busy to fit an epic like this into my gaming schedule.</notes>

    <notes>   I am selling my copy of Twilight Imperium 3rd edition. It is in good condition and has only been played once. It also comes with the Shattered Empires Expansion. Plus, it comes with a storage box for the counters and baggies for the ships and other things. I put the game in good condition because the cover does have a tear in it for those that care, but it can be taped. The components themselves are in excellent condition. I am asking $120 plus shipping for it. 
I will ship to the US only or if you live in the DC area, you can come and pick it up. </notes>

It weighs well over four pounds so overseas shipping will be very expensive if your country has a four pound limit on first class parcel.</notes>

    <notes>Vendo Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition Inglese, ITALIANIZZATO e con carte IMBUSTATE. Tutte le componenti sono presenti. Le carte sono sempre state tenute imbustate e ho italianizzato tutte le carte e le 8 tessere azioni.
Sono completamente imbustate e già italianizzate (inserendo le stampe tradotte nelle carte imbustate):
- Tutte le Carte Azioni
- Tutte le Carte Politiche
- Tutte le Carte Obiettivo
- Tutte le Carte Strategia
- Tutte le Carte Tecnologia per le 6 razze (per le carte Tecnologia di 2 razze non ho completato l_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;italianizzazione ma sono comunque imbustate e provvedo già le stampe da inserire nelle carte imbustate).
Non sono imbustate/italianizzate le carte pianeta, che non necessitano mai di essere mischiate, nè di traduzione.
La scatola è tenuta molto bene, solo segnata sull_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;angolo sinistro come visibile dalla foto. Le restanti componenti (segnalini, schede razze) sono tutte complete e in condizioni perfette.

Box is a bit ragged, but components are in great shape.  Bought on this site from a fellow BGG member.  Played it a few times, and not a good fit for my group.  Includes a few printouts I found online with game FAQ_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, handouts, etc.
Buyer pays shipping from zip code 77539.  If paying by personal check, I must make sure the check clears before I can ship.  If paying by other secure online method (Paypal, etc), I can ship immediately.</notes>

    <notes>This includes the base game, as well as the two expansions, Shards of the Throne and Shattered Empire.  All of the components are in the two expansion boxes (I do not have the base game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;coffin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; size box).  Game is opened, punched, bagged but in excellent, hardly played condition from a smoke free home; rules have been reviewed.    Boxes have scratches, rubbing and one of the boxes has a rip on the box bottom that has been taped - boxes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;work_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but this is not a collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy or likely one for you to resell - as for the boxes; components are in excellent condition.

    <notes>Comes with Shattered Empire expansion. Almost all of the components are in like new condition except for one piece. 1 War Sun in the Black color was chewed by the dog. Expansion came with two extra colors (grey and orange) so this hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been a problem for us playing it and the piece is still present and usable, albeit a little flatter. 
I would prefer to  arrange local pick up in Los Angeles, but will attempt to give estimates to those interested.
I can accept PayPal and Chase QuickPay.

    <notes>This game includes Shards of the Throne and Shattered Empire all in the same box (no insert). I also have the expansion boxes (in excellent condition) with their original inserts if you want them. 
The whole package is in great condition with sleeved cards (errata_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d cards are sorted out and unsleeved). Some minor box wear/dishing from age, but nothing major. Buyer will pay shipping from 55102 or local pickup in the twin cities. We can work to find as affordable a shipping solution as possible.</notes>

    <notes>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition) + Shattered Empire expansion. All components are included and all components are in very good condition. The only exception to this is the rulebooks, which are included but in good (rather than _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) condition.
$25 + FREE SHIPPING
HOWEVER: Neither game box is included. All components will be shipped in well-packed baggies in a 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 5.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; USPS box. So this is not the copy to buy if you want to proudly display the TI3 coffin box on your shelf. It IS the copy you want to buy if you only care how it looks on the table and you want TI3 and its first expansion for an unbeatable price. Honestly, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not even making any money off of this--pretty much all of it is going toward shipping. I just want to see it go to a good home. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This includes the base game, as well as the two expansions, Shards of the Throne and Shattered Empire; all from a smoke free home.  All of the components are punched , organized and bagged but in unplayed, like new condition.  I currently maintain all of the components in the two expansion boxes but I do have the original base game coffin box as well if buyer wishes to have all boxes mailed (it will increase the shipping cost I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure).  The reason I have this listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is that I do not have the two expansion box inserts.  Otherwise, the game components are like new.  Boxes are also in excellent condition.    Buyer to pay priority mail shipping and pay pal fee.</notes>

    <notes>TI3 + Shattered Empires expansion (in the base game box). The game as been played around 10 times and the box has some general wear and tear due to the shear size of the thing. Materials are in superb condition. Since there was a miss-print on a couple of the cardboard sheets of the base game, I received a completely new set from FFG, meaning that you have a lot of extra planets and you can make a monster-sized game with them.
I will ship internationally with dhl.de with no added cost. Check the website to see what the cost to your country would be (you need a standard DHL package (above 2 kg) for thi baby).</notes>

    <notes>Condition: Components are in like new condition (Race Sheets are still factory sealed) with a few exceptions. All minis have been removed from the sprues,1 purple carrier is broken into two pieces and 1 green fighter is broken in to two pieces, both pieces for each are present and could be glued back together. A few of the components have slight edge wear from being loose when shipped to me. The box is in okay condition, it is structurally stable, but the lid has 1 blown corner and there are scrapes in several places. Pictures available upon request.</notes>
