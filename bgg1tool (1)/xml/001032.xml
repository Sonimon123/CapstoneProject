   <description>B-17: Queen of the Skies is a strategy game which re-creates the early bombing missions and aerial combat of the B-17 (F Model) bombers of the US Eighth Air Force over Europe between November 1942 and May 1943. Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player). If each player has their own copy of B-17, then they can fly their bomber while playing the same mission as part of the formation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is complete and in excellent condition. The box is in excellent shape, intact with no split corners and only very slight normal boxx scuffing from storage. Components are complete. I counted all the counters and verified them against the scan on the geek. All 85 printed and three blank counters are present and accounted for, as are the 16 fighter cards and the maps cand charts. The mission chart pad has 31 double-sided charts left. The only thing missing from this game is the Composite Mission Record, two pages where you keep track of your overall missions. But there is a handy PDF right here on the Geek to replace that. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed off two replacements and have invluded them in the box. Game also includes a graphical representation of the Defensive Fire Chart from the General. I will also include a copy of The General vol 20, no. 6 with several articles on B-17.</notes>

    <notes>This game is complete and has been punched and played a few times.  The box is solid but does have moderate wear and the residue of where a small old price sticker once was.  The manual has highlighting on 4 of the pages but is otherwise in excellent condition.  All 16 fighter cards and 88 counters are present as indicated by the equipment list.  The counters and plane cards are in good condition.  The charts are all present as is the original Avalon Hill catalog insert.  The Mission Log tablet is also present and seems to have been hardly used at all.
I am including an extra paper map and rule errata/variants from the Avalon Hill General.  This allows for 15th air force attacks in southern Europe and the Balkans.  It also has a graphical B-17 defensive fire chart. There are 10 pages (counting front and back) of these additional rules/map/charts and they appear to be removed directly from a General magazine.
Buyer to pay USPS Priority Mail flat rate not to exceed $9.15.  Insurance would be an additional $1.65.  International buyers would need to contact me for rates.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll post pictures later if necessary.</notes>

    <notes>Left side and about a half-inch of the top of the outer box has been stripped of original artwork, and is missing a 4-inch-long piece along the upper left-hand side. On the inside bottom of the box there is a water stain about a half-inch wide and 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long on upper left side. All original components, however, are in good, used condition, including: 11_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mounted Mapboard, Strategic Movement Board, five tables and charts (for various dice results), 85 of 88 chits (plus one blank chit), Crew Placement Board, Rules Folder, one Composite Mission Record Sheet, 28 double-sided Mission Charts (for recording results of missions), and 16 German Fighter Cards. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have two original six-sided dice, but will provide if you wish.SHIPPING: Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Insurance is optional but recommended. I will contact you with the amount but the cost is exactly what I pay to ship the item to you. The game will be shipped upon receipt of payment.

    <notes>Complete and in quite nice shape. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d say this is actually between Good and VG but will err on the side of caution. A few counters unpunched; the rest look hardly used. One of the five colored chart cards (the green one) has some notes written in pen. The mission pad looks to only be missing a few sheets, and extra photocopies of those and the composite mission record are included.
Box has some light wear to the edges but is otherwise in nice shape.
Default shipping is Priority Mail flat rate box; contact me and we can work something else out. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the US and interested, let me know and I can come up w/a  shipping total.</notes>

    <notes>Condition summary: This game would be Very Good except for the box.
The game is complete.  The counters are punched, unclipped, and stored in a baggie.  The fighter cards have been separated and show no wear, though AH could have used a better color palette.  The mounted map board is very good, as are the placement and strategic movement boards.  The thick cardstock player aids are showing wearing the corner but are otherwise very good.  The rulebook looks very good except some waving as if from damp.  The box is good to adequate, with scuffing on the front and sides.  A Fine Games (who I bought this game from) sticker has left some discoloration on the bottom of the front lid.  The front lid also looks like it was banged against the edge of a table in one place.  The bottom lid has warped a little, forming air pockets between the cover art and cardboard.  Also, there are numerous small indentations on the back which I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t identify; the closest approximation is if someone wrote on the back with a ball-point pen without ink.
Contact me and I can give you a full description of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition and/or post pictures; no surprises or risks on your end.
For every additional game you purchase, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take $5 off, and you save on shipping.  Will ship via USPS, priority mail or media mail (if allowed) within the US.</notes>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Game hovers on the line between Good _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Very Good. 
This copy is verified complete. (It is missing only the 3 blank counters that are not needed for play.)
Set is relatively lightly played. (Please see attached image of the copy you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive.) Box has some surface wear, but is in good structural shape (ie no loose corners, splits, etc.).
Set has some annotations on the various Cards. This seems mostly a matter of corrections based on the errata and added page number references to help when looking up a rule. Game board has a similar annotation. 
By default shipping is via USPS box, but arrangements can be made for other USPS shipping options. Will ship worldwide
Thanks _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Have Fun!

    <notes>Game has some slight shelf wear that can be expected of a game this old.  The game has been played quite a bit, however all the pieces are accounted for and are in very good condition. Composite Mission Chart used quite a bit, but can be erased and used to make photo copies.
I can provide pictures of the game if you would like.  Just email me with the request.
I ship using flat rate boxes, as this appears to be the most cost effective means of shipping that I can tell.  If you would like to insure the game, please add $1.85 to the shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>The counters were punched, but the game was never played. The box is in near mint condition except for a 3/4 inch by 1/2 inch mark that was made when I opened the box. My copy was bought new, but it had tape on the sides (like Hasbro puts on expansions) instead of shrink-wrap. There are Avalon Hill stickers on the back to show the game number. There is a sticker on the front that says _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For Ages 8 and Up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>This is a bargain I would say.
The counters have been puched and very neatly clipped. They have had almost no use.
The rulebook is in excellent condition, though it has been extremely neatly annotated in two places. Likewise, the charts and tables cards have also been very neatly annotated in only a few places, but are also in excellent condition.
The other play-aids and the B-17 main board are also in excellent condition.
The game also includes the Defensive Fire Chart from The General, neatly hard-back mounted.
Please contact me for shipping costs if you live outside the UK.
Shipping in the UK is GBP 11.22, recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.

    <notes>This is the AH version from 1983.
The box shows signs of waer at the corners and is slightly faded (jaded?) in colour. Still structurally sound.
Counters and Luftwaffe fighter cards have been used, but are still in good condition.
The rulebook has been read, but neverthless is still in good condition, as are the player-aid cards. There are a few instances of pencil annotations, but they are few and far between.
The main board is also in good condition.
I will be flexible on shipping, and offer packing in a sturdy box or use of a bubble-wrapped envelope for a cheaper option.

    <notes>Punched but complete.  Includes the Defensive Fire Chart from an issue of the Avalon Hill General.  Played only once or twice, in pristine condition.  The box has a bit of minor scuffing, but is otherwise like new.  See picture for detail.  I ship USPS Regional Priority Mail from 22153.  This game should fit in a size A box.  I will also ship to Canada, but you should be aware that shipping is likely to be very high, perhaps $20+.</notes>

    <notes> This game has been punched but not played,thus _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Take to the skies in WW2 in one of the most memorable and iconic aircraft ever built for warfare.
Captain a crew of a Flying Fortress,B-17 bomber and deliver a blow to the Axis enemy.
Through the realism of the game-play experience the fear of arial combat.The fatigue of the mission as you manage a damaged bird home.
This game is one of the most engaging solitaire games around and it has the Avalon Hill pedigree.
If you already have the game add this one to your Hangar number;fly squadron missions.
If you do not have the game then buy this and I can offer a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;return if not satisfied _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;* as I know you will want to keep it.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played it once (25+ years ago as a teenager), flew a few missions but used scratch paper instead of the supplied log sheets.
Included are scanned pages for the 15th AF and Lancaster variants.

    <notes>The only thing stopping me listing this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is the fact that one of the box corners is split. Other than that the game is untouched - all the sheets and rulebook are perfect, as is the gameboard, and the aircraft _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are still unpunched.
Will ship to anywhere in the UK free of charge (not Europe - didnt give me the option of selecting UK only). I will need a delivery address where someone will be in attendance as the parcel will need signing for.</notes>

    <notes>B-17 by Avalon Hill. This copy is in excellent condition and could almost be considered to have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; components. Appears to either never been played or only played once. Cards were separated and counters strip-punched with many still attached together. Full log pad with one unused sheet separated (perhaps to make a copy from). 2 player aid cards separated from the pad, the rest are still unseparated. All cards and counters bagged in zip. Game is inventoried and guaranteed to be complete. Box has minor shelf wear and some minor wrinkling on cover. Nothing extreme and no blown corners.
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H to the US is $15,00
Please ask about international shipping costs.
