I painted the town discs white so that they look like the white towns on the game board.  This copy also includes a high quality in color game mats that keep track of numbers of shares, income, level of train, special actions and goods. These mats are laminated.  I am also including player aids on card stock.

    <notes>Age of Steam 1st edition.
All components and rulebooks are complete and in like-new condition. Official Detroit sticker (sent to me from Winsome Games) has been affixed to the board, but is probably easily removed if you prefer.
I am also including two high resolution, full color, laminated scoring/goods mats. They are the color ones posted here on BGG. They are absolutely amazing!
Shipping to the US/Canada is $20. Shipping anywhere else is $30.00.
I also have a like-new copy of Expansion #1 (England _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Ireland), complete with the rules sheet. I will sell the base game and expansion as a package for $200 (shipping included in this price).

It was translated by Korean 
But you can play by _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;printed english ver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s income track and goods track_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;

Paper money is better than plastic coin because Paper money declared value

    <notes>Played only 1x !!! - Everything in near mint condition.  Also included are 2 color-toned mats (income track + goods display):
http://files.boardgamegeek.com/geekfile_view.php?fileid=16517
http://files.boardgamegeek.com/geekfile_view.php?fileid=16518
Both of which I custom laminated (pictures available upon request).  I preferred these colored mats because it added some _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pizzaz_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; over the dull original mats (which I *still* have and are also included) while not being overly busy or hard to see.
Also included are the easy-to-pick AOS Puerto Rico -like _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Action Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (Also laminated like the mats above):

And the condensed player aide:

... A *LOT* of meticulous hours _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; effort went into this game that unfortunately only saw one play.  I am hoping this will go to a good home where it can be appreciated and enjoyed.  The game unfortunately doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit our weekly time-window.  Game will be packaged well and placed in an oversized box with plenty of packing material all-around.

    <notes>English edition with expansions #1, #2, #3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; #4 included. 
Allow me to repeat that: Expansions #1, #2, #3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; #4 included.
All the track, money and city tokens are neatly sorted in a separate fishing tackle box. Expansions (just) fit in the original box.
Box has split on one corner _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; rules have an example highlighted. Otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in very good condition.
Selling because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little too complicated to play with my family and need funds for new games.
Direct bank transfer is the best way to pay.

Condition Notes:
No longer in shrink, but still unpunched or unused.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

    <notes>2nd edition.  Punched but never played.
It is in perfect condition.  I was tempted to keep it but I snagged a slightly less new but still nice copy in an auction and decided to sell this again at the price that I paid. 2nd edition is the best, in my opinion, with updated rules and a board typo rectified, and wooden tokens (rather than the plastic trains of the 3rd).  You won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find a better price on a game that is basically new.
I accept paypal or money orders.  Shipping is extra, however you prefer.</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101204N)
The classic and original version is now back in print and looks better than ever! Steam-belching iron horses roar across the wild plains! Age of Steam relives the era when pioneering U.S. railroads built the tracks that transformed America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s economy. The cut-throat action is centered on the industrial powerhouses of the growing nation: Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and beyond. Competition is brutal, with the game usually going to the player who plans most carefully. Each self-contained phase in the game keeps players constantly involved in making vital decisions and interacting with other players. Age of Steam also allows towns to be developed into cities, ensuring that no two games are exactly the same. </notes>

Includes the base game and 59 expansions.  Everything is in excellent condition.  Some still in shrink, others only played once, few played more than once.  Comes stored in 6 boxes, 5 tubes, and a large manila envelope (for maps formatted larger than letter size and not sold in a tube).  After some quick math on the history of these items on BGG, it would cost close to $2000 to acquire these games (with some not currently available at all).
Please message me with any questions you may have.

    <notes>Also in the box is Expansion #2 Western United States and Germany.  Had this game for years but never actually played it.  The track tiles are lose in the box, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t recall if they came that way, money discs are still in the original packaging.  I opened the box and read the rules, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all the handling this game got.  Unsure about exact edition - back of the box says printed in Germany Warfrog/Winsome games 2001, so I assumed 1st.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.  But note that the original paper money that came with the game is no longer included.  Most people (including my local group) use poker chips for train games such as this and the paper money was thrown into the garbage a long time ago.  Note:  my poker chips are NOT included in this offer.  However, see my separate listing for poker chips if you need some.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>This copy is in very good condition and includes the base game map along with the following expansion maps (all in the base game box along with the original game materials and map):
- Age of Steam Expansion: Outer Space _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Reversteam (English first edition) (2011)
- Age of Steam Expansion: Secret Blueprints of Steam Plans 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2 (Bezier Games edition) (2008)
- Age of Steam Expansion: Vermont, New Hampshire _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Central New England (Bezier Games Edition) (2008)
This copy does not include the plastic trains, which have been replaced by the premium wooden disks from Eagle-Gryphon Games (similar to those in Steam) and does not include the paper money as we always use poker chips in lieu of the paper money (as most Age of Steam groups do). Poker chips are not included.</notes>
