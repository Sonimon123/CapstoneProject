   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for a pre-order of a brand new copy of the upcoming X-Wing Miniatures Game. The estimated due date is mid-September.
UK shipping costs are £5 to your nearest collect+ convenience store (where you can then pick up the parcel whenever they are open) or £6 delivered to your door. Delivery normally takes 3-5 days. We only deliver to the mainland UK since shipping to Europe and further afield is ludicrously expensive.
If you are interested please respond to this marketplace listing and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll register your interest. Payment and fulfilment would then happen once we get a confirmed date from the supplier.
If you would like to buy multiple copies or get expansions at the same time as the base game let me know and we can sort out a saving on postage costs for you. We can also offer great prices on other games ordered at the same time as X-Wing.
Happy gaming!

X-Wing is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, X-Wing recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission! The X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, X-Wing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe. </notes>

X-Wing is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, X-Wing recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission! The X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, X-Wing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quick-to-learn rule set establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.</notes>

    <notes>Star Wars X-Wing Miniatures Game Core Set - Brand new in shrink.
Multiple copies for sale. Will combine shipping if you want more than one. You can definitely play with a single core set and 2 players, but many feel that 2 (or even 3) core sets is ideal:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/976243/4-core-sets-or
Game(s) will be packed with care. Feel free to check my 100% positive marketplace and trade feedback.
Buyer pays actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred. International buyers must also cover insurance (usually only $2-3 extra) to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

1 - TIE Bomber Expansion Pack (In plastic unopened)
1 - B-Wing Expansion Pack (In plastic unopened)
1 - Lambda-class Shuttle Expansion Pack (In plastic unopened)
All of the ships are in great condition. They were used only a few times and some have never even been opened. I have them all stored in the plastic container they were bought in as well. All of the cards from the opened miniatures have the cards sleeved also.
If shipped in the USA I will cover the shipping. If Canada I will cover the first $15 of the shipping. I would be willing to take offers as well. Message me if interested.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGSWX01)
X-Wing is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, X-Wing recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission! The X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, X-Wing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quick-to-learn rule set establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe. </notes>

    <notes>Ich verkaufe folgendes (alles auf Deutsch):
* X-Wing Coreset (1 X-wing, 2 TIE-Fighters + Würfel und Tokens + alles was man braucht)
* A-Wing Erweiterung
* B-Wing Erweiterung
* Y-Wing Erweiterung
* TIE Bomber Erweiterung
* TIE Interceptor Erweiterung
* TIE Advanced Erweiterung
* Lambda Class Shuttle Erweiterung
* Extra Würfel Set
Ich habe das Spiel maximal 7 mal gespielt und es ist in einem guten Zustand. Doch damit es keine Überraschungen gibt:
* Einmal ist mir ein TIE Fighter abgebrochen, wurde aber sofort sehr vorsichtig mit Sekundenkleber repariert.
* Die Originalverpackungen sind nicht mehr da, weil die etwas unpraktisch waren. Die Packung vom Starter Set ist aber noch da.
* Ein paar Gebrauchsspuren (minimal)
Ich würde mich bemühen alles sorgfältig einzupacken.
Wenn man bei dem günstigsten Anbieter in Deutschland guckt, kostet alles zusammen über €110 neu.
Versand nur nach Deutschland. Rabatt für Berliner, die das Spiel abholen möchten. Überweisung oder Barzahlung.
Vielen Dank für euren Besuch, gerne könnt ihr euch bei Fragen melden.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling off my collection of miniatures for the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures game made by Fantasy Flight Games. The set is pretty large, and contains every expansion released to date up to the Imperial Aces (which only just released). The lot includes:
2x copies of the Core Starter Set
1x extra set of TIE Fighters and an X-Wing from a third core set (none of the other components though).
1x X-Wing Expansion
1x A-Wing
2x B-Wings
1x Y-Wing
1x HWK-290
1x Millenium Falcon
1x TIE Fighter Expansion
2x TIE Interceptors
1x TIE Bomber
1x TIE Advanced
1x Slave-1
1x Lambda Class Shuttle
Everything is in like new condition. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played the game once, so everything is in fantastic shape and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been stored in solidly secure tackle box since I got it.  I like the game, but not enough to keep it when there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s so many other games I also play.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship throughout the US using USPS Priority Flat Rate.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure which box I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have to use (I may go larger just to make sure everything_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s safe and secure) so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just asking $10 to ship: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover the rest if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s any more than that.</notes>

    <notes>This is for one of each of the first three waves, plus the core set and the extra dice expansion. That means all told you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting
Core Set
Dice Pack
    X-Wing Expansion Pack
    TIE Fighter Expansion Pack
    Y-Wing Expansion Pack
    TIE Advanced Expansion Pack 
Wave #2
    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Millennium Falcon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Expansion Pack
    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Slave I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Expansion Pack
    A-Wing Expansion Pack
    TIE Interceptor Expansion Pack 
Wave #3
    Lambda Shuttle Expansion Pack
    HWK-290 Expansion Pack
    B-Wing Expansion Pack
    Tie Bomber Expansion Pack
These are almost entirely unplayed. Except for the base set, I bought them, fiddled with them for fun, and put them away. A friend of mine has purchased everything released and we play with his set when we play.
This lot includes all the cards and chits and tokens included with all expansions. All of the ships are in their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;blister pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, with the exception of the Tie Bomber which fits in the large blister tray from the base game.
I selected _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition because it does not include the cardboard box of the base set or the pack from the extra dice. Otherwise, these are like new.
The cards are crisp. Most of the equipment cards were never used. The damage deck has been hand-over-hand shuffled a few short games.
This is a great way to get into the game, or boost your forces, or just grab a set of duplicate of cards if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re into tournament play.
If you have any questions please just ask. Shipping will be actual cost to your location through USPS.
Cheers, and happy gaming!</notes>

Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!
Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.
Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...
The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, Star Wars: X-Wing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.</notes>

To the base core set, I will include the six dice from the Dice Pack accessory.
I also offer a bundle with the base core set and twelve ships: one of each from the first three waves (X-Wing, TIE Fighter, Y-Wing, TIE Advanced; Millenium Falcon, Slave I, A-Wing, TIE Interceptor; B-Wing, TIE Bomber, HWK-290, Lambda Shuttle).
All this can be yours for CAN$ 162.
I still have the original boxes for the core set and the three large ships. The small ships are in their plastic protection box, but the hard plastic packaging is destroyed when opened. All components are in almost perfect condition.</notes>

    <notes>This lot is for a starter set of ships from Waves 0 and 1 of X-Wing. Included are:
* Two (2) Core Sets
* Two (2) X-Wing expansions
* Two (2) Y-Wing expansions
* One (1) Millennium Falcon expansion
* One (1) TIE Fighter expansion
* Three (3) TIE Advanced expansions
* One (1) TIE Interceptor expansion
All are complete, EXCEPT: One copy of each pilot reference card from a core set is missing (so, one Luke pilot card instead of two, three Red Squadron pilot cards instead of four, etc). ONLY the reference cards are affected; all ships and their cardboard tokens are present.
Components are sorted in a Plano 5231 tackle box (included) plus cards and rulebooks stored in the core set boxes; the expansion packaging is gone.
Buyer pays shipping; gut feeling is $15 - $20 USPS</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m getting out of X-Wing and into Armada. If anyone is interested in my small collection., I am offering it up as a lot, not piecemeal 
Complete ships, bits, and cards have been played less than a half dozen times and stored carefully otherwise. For the core sets, I have both original boxes and am throwing in a Plano 5231 case and a Battlefoam insert. I can provide more info and/or photos if necessary. 
Price includes US shipping. May consider other reasonable offers and/or Armada trades.
Thanks!

I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)

    <notes>All ships pictured of the Scum faction, plus all cards, dials, and tokens, sleeves, manuals. (Original boxes for most ships available if interested, pm me for info}.
11 small base (one in box, opened), 4 large base. All components.
These are my all from my personal collection. I played more than 50 casual games with my friends. However sadly they’ve lost interest or moved and I prefer to see games played rather than sit on a shelf.
I also have large Imperial and Rebel collection to sell as well.. PM me if interested in a single price for everything.
All ships are in good condition, however there a couple that have been glued to pegs for stability

    <notes>Shipping: Anywhere in US. Shipping depends on ZIP code. Feel free to IM me with any questions about these.
Condition: Collection includes both core sets, and some ships that are open, but were never played. I will list the like-new ships first:
X-wing - The Force Awakens core set (like new),
X-wing - core set (good condition, played the most. All pilots, including the ones from expansions, are sleeved.).
Expansions:
Lambda-class Shuttle Expansion Pack (never played),
B-Wing Expansion Pack (never played),
Imperial Aces (never played),
Millennium Falcon,
TIE Advanced,
TIE Phantom.
The bigger expansions still have their own box, the rest does not. Please see pictures on what I plan to ship if a sale happens. I can remove the components/ships from the storage box I have, and ship them inside the core sets if you would like to save on shipping.</notes>
