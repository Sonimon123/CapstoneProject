   <description>Once upon a time ..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I bought this game and played it twice with my group.  While we were all impressed, I got the feeling that it intimidated a few players and a different game would get more play.
Anyhow, everything is there and in pristine condition.  I even have high-quality printouts of English player aids and the expansion tiles.  
I can do local pickup in the East Bay Area.  CA orders pay 7.25% sales tax.

    <notes>I am getting rid of this game because I realized it was a perfect example of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cube confusion._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; There, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m being honest - hopefully you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll like it better than I do. With that said, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in excellent shape. The only reason why I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m giving it a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition is because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it three times. However, all the components and box are in Like New condition. The only wear you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be able to see is in the rulebook, with some slight wrinkling. Everything is bagged and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including some payer-aid printouts from the Geek. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll make sure to package it well, to ensure minimal shifting in transit. I have two other games up for sale - if you want more than one maybe we can work something out where I pay a part of shipping or something. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not doing this to make a killing - basically I just need to free up some shelf space so my wife won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t badger me about getting more games. Gotta feed the habit you know.</notes>

Punched but never played. English language edition from Ystari.
[ImageID=136281]
Note that the tiles are cut slightly off-center - not a big deal, but they are visibly not dead-center. The little unpainted king figure is also broken from its base. In fact you will get two, yes two, broken kings!!! Everything else is beautiful.

    <notes>This game is 2nd printing which includes the Jeweler tile.  This is a great game but another member of our group has a copy and I really need to make room for other stuff.  This game is in excellent (Like New) condition and is priced to sell.  I will ship the same day or next day after payment is made.  Check my feedback.
I only charge actual shipping costs.  You can send me your zip code and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you an exact shipping quote.  I usually ship Parcel Post but sometimes Priority with my online discount is cheaper.
I take PayPal only unless prior arrangements are made.  I also ship to the PayPal address only.</notes>

    <notes>This is a new in factory shrinkwrap copy of the 1st English edition of Caylus.  (This version is distinct because of the different cover art than appears on later editions.) This version was made in Germany and features rules in both English _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; French. Game is mint in its original shrinkwrap. Image below is actual copy up for sale. 
Game fits nicely in a USPS Priority Mail Medium Flat Rate Box.

Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.

    <notes>This is the rare FIRST EDITION which is functionally the same as later editions, but awesomer.
The cover art features an architect rather than a grumpy looking king (see image), and the cloth cubes are a little more purple and a little less indigo. Includes the Jeweler tile and cardboard money.</notes>

I would have no qualms about giving this as a used gift to a friend. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been sitting on my shelf, unplayed, for about 2 years. Time for somebody else to own it, who will get better use out of it than me.
I will only ship to verified Paypal addresses. Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Opened _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; played a few times.
1st Edition, so no Jeweler tile.  Picture on front is the architect holding up the scroll, looking up at the castle.
Can ship or do face-to-face handoff in the Washington DC area.
Will combine shipping for multiple purchases.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m flexible with shipping. USPS seems cheapest. Use http://postcalc.usps.gov/ to estimate a price, shipping from 20171, weight of 2 lbs 15 ounces, I can use the pay online feature.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO281)
Once upon a time ... 1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up. The players embody master builders. By building the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game. </notes>

    <notes>Very first printing of Caylus.  Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>I bought this, punched the pieces, read the rulebook, and then realised how similar it is to a lot of other games I already own.  Decided to sell in as unspoiled a condition as possible, so it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been played.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll accept cash on collection or delivery in the Manchester area, or PayPal.
Shipping will be Parcelforce express48, which is included in the price.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO281)
Once upon a time ... 1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up. The players embody master builders. By building the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game. </notes>

    <notes>This is actually a Chinese version of the game, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really matter since the gameplay doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t involve any printed words. English instructions are provided. I have not specified the version in the description because BBG doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have a Chinese version listed. This comes from a smoke-free, cat-free home. The game was played only a few times. I can ship express if you want.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO281)
Once upon a time ... 1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up. The players embody master builders. By building the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.  Limited Edition.  Hard to find.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
