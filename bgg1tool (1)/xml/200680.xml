    <notes>You are NOT buying a copy of the game, but rather a bag of 54 animeeples that exactly match what comes in the game (to make up for the shortfall you can experience in the new version at larger player counts).  There are 21 sheep, 18 pigs, and 15 cows in the bag.  The cow color may not match exactly (in my set it was close), but the pigs and sheep are an exact match.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to run out of animeeples during the game, especially at higher player counts, these might be right for you.
