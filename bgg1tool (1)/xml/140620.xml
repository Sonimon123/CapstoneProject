   <description>On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lewis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lewis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;handbuilding_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMLULCK01ML)
On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers - Meriwether Lewis and William Clark - to discover this huge terra incognita. Lewis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance. </notes>

On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers - Meriwether Lewis and William Clark - to discover this huge terra incognita. Lewis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance. </notes>

    <notes>First edition.  Board, cards, and pieces are all in good shape.  The resources are stickered.  The box has a crease on the front and back.  The graphics on both sides of the box are starting to peel at the bottom corners, and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just general shelf wear.  The box is still intact and holding together well, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just a lot of cosmetic damage.
Depending on where you live shipping costs $5-10.  Feel free to ask for the exact cost.  Games get mailed USPS Priority and typically go out the business day after payment is received.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMLULCK01ML)
On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers - Meriwether Lewis and William Clark - to discover this huge terra incognita. Lewis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.</notes>

It is playable, would just say not cosmetically 100% due to warping issues.  Priced to move, but happy to answer any questions about condition.  No refunds.</notes>

    <notes>Game components are all in very good condition - however, the box is a bit worn around the edges, and two of the corners are dented (bashed on delivery - the game will be well-packaged in the post this time to prevent any further damage from occurring!) 
Postage within the UK will be £4.00 via Royal Mail. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very happy to combine shipping on multiple items - please message me for an estimate.</notes>

    <notes>Simply a gorgeous game that does not get enough attention in my home.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve held on to this one for years without it getting played simply because the art is that beautiful.  As my collection grows, however, I have to make tough choices.
Someone will enjoy looking at this as much as I have!
