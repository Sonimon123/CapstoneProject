   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ouml;k has come, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s the end of the world! It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s the Vikings_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Gods_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; Gifts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Kickstart pledge including 5th player expansion.
I backed the KS but need to get my money out due to an unforseen medical expense for my son, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my pledge for what I pledged ($105) + what I paid in shipping ($10). I will update the pledge manager to change the address to ship directly to you or, if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no longer an option by the time you purchase, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to you after delivery and will cover shipping costs myself.</notes>

    <notes>[b]Condition[/b]: Kickstarter Ragnarok Pledge. Will ship when I receive it, buyer pays actual shipping costs. I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t give an estimate as to how much shipping will be until I receive the game, so you can buy it now and once it is time to ship it out you can pay the balance. The game shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be any heavier than 10 pounds (just my guess).
[b] I did not order the 5th player expansion[/b], or any other extras from the campaign.
[b]Shipping[/b]: Buyer pays actual shipping costs. Ships from zipcode 70003. Most games will fit in a USPS Medium Flat Rate Box. Geek Mail me if you wish to know the shipping price beforehand with your zip code.
[b]Payment[/b]:
Paypal: To be sent as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; [b](as a gift)[/b] to avoid fees.
USPS Money Order is acceptable. 
Please leave feedback after receiving your game and I shall do the same, thank you! Feedback can be left by clicking the feedback text on the side bar and then clicking pending feedback.</notes>

FOR EUROPE: 
- sending it in 1 single package costs 30,10 euros or more.
- as an alternative, I can open the game, punch the components for you, and divide it into 2 packages (2kg + 500gr) that would cost 12,75 + 5, so a total of 17,75 euros.
REST OF THE WORLD:
- sending it in 1 single package costs 50,40 euros or more.
- as an alternative, I can open the game, punch the components for you, and divide it into 2 packages (2kg + 500gr) that would cost 21 + 7,50, so a total of 28,50 euros.</notes>

Blood Rage: 5th Player Expansion
Blood Rage: Gods of Ásgard
Blood Rage: Mystics of Midgard
Note: This is the retail copy of the game. It does not come with the Kickstarter extras.
The game is barely played and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in like new condition. As much as I love this game, I need the money for personal expenses. 
I will provide enough padding or packing material to make sure the game shipped without damage. The game will be shipped within 1-business day after the payment is cleared through PayPal (i.e. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;payment for goods_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to protect both the seller and buyer). The shipment will include tracking and optional insurance (covered by buyer).

This does include all the exclusives that came with the KS version, (Gods of Midgard, Mystics of Midgard, Ram Clan, Extra Monsters and other bits).  There is no damage to the box, but due to the description of Condition, I would say this is a Good condition.</notes>

Game has only been played twice.
The player figures are quasi-painted (I painted parts of them a solid color in acrylic paint to make them easy to tell apart, as pictured). This can be removed with a product like Simple Green Paint Remover.
All Monsters are still unpainted.

    <notes>Condition: Excellent. Played twice with the cards in sleeves. The box has a small dent on one corner; that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how it arrived when I ordered it. The expansion components were purchased from someone else who had played them twice. The expansion boxes have some wear, but the components are all in excellent condition. After reading the next section you may not even want the boxes for the expansions.
Important note: Includes the Blood Rage Insert from Go7Gaming (http://go7gaming.com/product/insert-for-blood-rage/). This is a very nice wooden insert which fits all of the components from the base game and all expansions. I ordered this before I decided to sell the game so the insert is still new in the box. For a few extra $$ I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll offer to glue it together and put the game and all of its expansions together in a single box.
Also Includes:
* Gods of Asgard
* Mystics of Midgard
* 5th Player Expansion
* 5th Player Extras (KS exclusive)
* Wild-boar Clan Expansion (KS exclusive)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m disinclined to sell the exclusives separately, nor do I want to sell the base game without the insert, but feel free to geekmail me with requests or offers.
Does NOT include:
Mountain Giant, Wolfman, Fenrir, or Mystic Troll (KS exclusives)
For buyers in the Seattle area: This one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy and has a lot of little boxes so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering a $20 discount for local purchases (cash happily accepted for local pickup).
Other payment types accepted: Miniature Market or Coolstuffinc Gift Certificates, Cash (local).</notes>

    <notes>This is a retail copy of the game that has been played twice and is in excellent condition.  The box insert has been removed.  Also included in the main box is the Gods of Asgard expansion and the Mystics of Midgard expansion.  The expansions have been opened but never used.  The expansion components have been combined with the core game and there are no expansion boxes.  All items in this listing are retail editions.
I will ship via USPS Priority Mail so shipping is $16.50.</notes>

    <notes>Complete Kickstarter Ragnarok Pledge with 5th player add-on. No artbook. 
PLEASE REFER TO PHOTOS HERE: http://imgur.com/a/Pjt1a
I would describe the base game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. There is significant damage to the box (two split corners, moderate wear everywhere else), but all components are present and in great condition. 
The 5th player expansion, the 5th player extras, and Mystics of Midgard are Like New. Cards still in shrink, never been used. 
The Gods of Asgard and Kickstarter Exclusive monsters are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been used once or twice but still in great condition overall.
Let me know if you have any questions, I will do my best to accommodate you!

    <notes>This is new in shrink. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a bunch of Blood Rage stuff. For every item you buy past the first I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take 5 bucks off the total price.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship world-wide. It is usually pretty expensive, so be prepared for the shipping cost to exceed the game cost for a single game. Bundling works better, but still costly.</notes>

    <notes>The game is almost like new. It was played only twice. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it because I will not have a chance to play it with my current game group and I need to clear shelf space. If you want to see some pictures of the components, let me know.
I will ship anywhere in Europe, inquire for price estimate. 
It is possible to pick the game up in person in Brussels, Belgium.
Trust issues?
So, you are wondering: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;can I trust this guy, he only sold few things here in the market! Can I trust him?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Well, you can. In fact these are the first items I sell on the geekmarket, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only now starting. Despite that, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a regular BGG user with love for boardgames and in a mission to spread them.
