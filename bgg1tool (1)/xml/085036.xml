   <description>In the 20th Century, every country strives to develop and improve, each in its own way. Some become financial leaders. Others become centers of learning. Both science and commerce serve to propel nations toward the future _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but toward what kind of future? Growth produces waste, and the greatest advances may come with the greatest cost to the environment.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO426)
In the 20th Century, every region strives to develop. Some become financial leaders, others become centers of learning. Science and commerce propel nations into the future - but what kind of future? Growth produces waste, and advances come with a cost to the environment. How will you mitigate the inevitable ecological catastrophes? Your goal is to provide a place where the environment is as healthy as the economy. Only then can you consider your region to be truly developed. The game consists of six rounds, during which you oversee the urbanization of your region. Lands produce income, scientific research, or improve the quality of life. Research allows you to discover new technologies that will shape the way your nation develops. Science can help you avert ecological catastrophes. You accumulate points each round, based on your nation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quality of life. At the end of the game, you will score bonus points based on your country_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s income, research, and environmental quality. </notes>
