   <description>Publisher blurb_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Including a total of 180 plastic figures and dozens of unit types, Starcraft: The Board Game features an innovative modular board of varying sizes, which guarantees a new experience each and every game. An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Z-Axis_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Reimplements_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     StarCraft (video game)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I sell out of Elliot Lake, ONTARIO, Canada.
I feel I offer the best prices for Canadians on this website, if you find a cheaper price contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see what I can do!
Shipping within Canada is $8 for small board games (munchkin, carcassonne, settlers) $10 for medium games (shadows over camelot, arkham, talisman) and $14 for large games (WoW, Twilight Imperium, Starcraft, Descent) US Customers add $2. If you place an order without contacting me first, use this as a guideline for what to send for shipping I am very easy to deal with if there is an error with payment we will work something out 
ALL ITEMS LISTED ship within 48 hours with tracking info within Canada and to the United States.

    <notes>Brand New in shrinkwrap. Never opened.
Some damage to the box corner where the base is creased and has actually split, but contents should all be fine.
I have kept a copy from the same source and everything in the box was perfect condition with the exception that a few models had come off their flying bases. I suspect this is quite common as they are a bit flimsy, and all the models are shipped bundled together in a plastic bag. Easily fixed with a bit of superglue. Otherwise in perfect condition.
This is a big heavy game, so I am estimating £10 postage in the UK. Collection welcome from Leeds. For other countries, please ask.  </notes>

    <notes>Great condition. Only played a few times. All pieces in good condition. The only reason I set the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is that the box is slightly dented on the bottom, but it is still solid.</notes>

    <notes>Played a couple of times, and is complete.  The game arrived new out of the box with a few of the stands broken.  I have received replacements from Fantasy Flight Games, so in some respects the condition of the game is better than when it was brand new.  Bits are punched, sorted, and bagged.  I have also included an extra (Black_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;White) printout of the instructions so you can have more than one copy at the gaming table.  The original rulebook is in very good condition.  Non smoking household.  Priority Mail shipping is estimated to be around $20 for this large of a game.  </notes>

    <notes>Game was opened and played once. When I first opened the game (brand new), several pieces were damaged, but I contacted the manufacturer and got replacements.
**THIS LISTING INCLUDES A BRAND NEW SHRINK-WRAPPED COPY OF THE BROOD WAR EXPANSION.**
Preferred payment method is an amazon.com giftcard. If you want to pay some other way, GM me and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll talk.
Buyer will pay actual shipping costs through the USPS. This will be a large, heavy box, so if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re worried about shipping costs, get a quote from me first. International shipping is fine, but I will not mark it as a gift and the customs forms will show the actual purchase price.

    <notes>Includes both Starcraft core game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Broodwar Expansion.
Both of the games are in like new condition overall. The shrinkwrap was removed from the boxes and the shrink wrap removed from the cards in the base game. All other items still sealed and unpunched. As such the game and the expansion has never been played.
If you only want one or the other title, GM me and we can talk.
A warning that shipping might be a bit of a killer for this one since it is a rather large box and quite heavy as well with all the cardboard and plastic models inside.
I make sure to ship games so that they arrive at your door in the same condition that they left my house in. The interior of game boxes will be packed to make sure contents do not shift during transit.
I will ship only to residences within the United States. Parcel tracking is mandatory for your and my protection. Insurance is strongly recommended. Buyer pays all shipping costs.
I only charge exact shipping amounts. I generally quote a bit higher on shipping estimates to make sure all costs are covered but any amount that goes over actual shipping costs I will refund. Games are expensive enough as it is without shipping costs biting into them.
GM me with any questions you might have or to request a shipping estimate to your zipcode. </notes>

    <notes>Opened, never played (everything is cleanly punched). Box has very minor wear at corners. INCLUDES BROOD WAR EXPANSION.
The expansion is included in the original game box, there is no game box for the expansion. The insert for the game has been flattened to accomodate the incredible amount of bits in the game. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including three sturdy plastic organizer boxes (think Plano) that house all of the miniatures and the cardboard tokens. Very organized and will ship well. ALL print materials included, including playaids for both the base game and expansion.

    <notes>Original Starcraft Board Game in English.
I bought it used a few years ago and it still hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come to the table to play (one aborted try), so I am selling it on for others to enjoy.
Faction cards and cardboard bits in ziplock bags. A number of helpful printouts from BGG also in the box.
Zerg faction is missing their box (the models came in white boxes) so are loose in the game box. NO missing models as I count. 
A single Yellow Arbiter has broken off his stand. Should be fixable with some superglue. 
On Shipping_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;
It is a fairly big box. Ideally should be shipped inside Germany. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind shipping elsewhere, just realize it is large and heavy so the shipping charges might be high. 
To payment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;
Payment per Paypal before I ship. If you are in Germany we can work out a bankueberweisung.
I am a private seller, just a gamer trying to clear out some space and see others enjoy games. I have counted all the pieces and described the condition to the best of my ability. </notes>

    <notes>Complete game includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Brood War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; expansion.
A few (two or three) of the flying units have broken off their bases but can be glued. 
The expansion is mixed in with the base game.  There is no box for the expansion, and the original box insert for the base game is also not present.
Contact me for a shipping quote.  Due to the size and weight of the game, shipping outside of Canada WILL be expensive.</notes>

    <notes>Technically better than new I think.  The game came with some battlecruisers off their flight stands.  I have repaired them.  Everything is present and 100% complete.  The game really is amazing to look at.  It has only been played once.  The cards are perfect.  You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have a great time with this gem :)</notes>

-------
Very nice copy of this Out of Print Classic, and hand counted to verify it is 100% complete (MAJOR PITA TOO!) 
This has only been played once and everything is in excellent condition. The one flaw might be the black edged cards showing the tiniest bit of wear (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m being picky here) otherwise hard to tell it was played. 
Even the Box shows very little to no wear at all only a couple very small nicks.
Can send pictures of anything if wanted 
I also can include the Brood War expansion new mint and still in shrinkwrap for $35 extra. 
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice.

    <notes>Starcraft is quite a rare game as it is out of print. The board game does really do justice to the orginal PC game. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling as I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really play this, I want to but just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get chance.
The box has slight scuffing especially on the corner.
The contents are in excellent condition, there is an extra Blue Terran Marine figure, one of the Yellow Protoss small ships spins on its post but is otherwise secure.
The game has been played 3 or 4 times and each factions components are stored in two Really Useful 0.3L boxes (which are mostly colour coded to the faction, which the exception of one clear box for the Orange Protoss faction.
It is really heavy and as a result it is not economical to post outside of the UK. Please contact me if you want it posting to europe for prices
Postage in the UK will be £12</notes>

    <notes>Only played once, pristine condition, tons of included Plano boxes for organization that fit back into the box.  One single miniature was malformed (see pictures) but I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find out until this was OOP.  Box has minor shelf wear, see pictures here:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/87845384@N08/sets/72157635505207383
You *must* buy the Brood War expansion from me as well if you buy this base game (expansion is in main box, does not have its own box).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping for base game plus expansion is $25 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$3.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).

    <notes>This is a complete, very good copy of the Starcraft board game and the Brood War expansion, both of which are from my personal collection. The main game has been opened but has never been played (accordingly, everything is complete!) and the Brood War expansion is totally brand new and still in the original clingwrap. As much as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve wanted to play this over the years, unfortunately my living/storage situation is about to change and so I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have room for it anymore... my loss is definitely your gain in this instance! For peace of mind, the game and expansion come from a non-smoking, no pet home.
 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $180 for the game and expansion combined, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take of the shipping (via USPS parcel post) anywhere within the continental U.S. Not only will you be getting a great deal on a great game + expansion, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be supporting a fellow BGG member in the process (and even making my wife happy that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m thinning the herd!).
 
One final thing to note--I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be traveling for the next week, so the earliest I can send out the game/expansion is next Friday, December 27th. 
Thanks so much for your interest and best wishes for the holidays!</notes>

    <notes>Game box includes the Brood War expansion [I placed the expansion in the main box].
The expansion was never played, main game played once. One or two ships arrived with defective stands straight from factory. So components are in factory-perfect conditions.
In addition, the game box itself is slightly damaged - one corner has been grazed, leaving minor scarring along its connection lines. 
Pictures will be sent upon request.

    <notes>Game never played, components like new.  Insert has some damage, see below.  Box has been opened and rulebook read, but everything else is in original packaging, cardboard unpunched:
-- Inside, the cardboard insert has been somewhat crushed and torn along one side.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a slot for cards, I think; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still functional, but definitely damaged.  Pictures available on request.
-- All cards in shrink
-- Cardboard unpunched, factory-sealed in plastic
-- Reference cards and player boards wrapped in those paper-thingies
-- Miniatures in original bag, unopened, but small tear along one seam where a piece edge poked through
Minor shelfwear on the exterior.</notes>

    <notes>Three powerful alien races battle for control of the galaxy. Whether you choose to lead the versatile Terran, mysterious Protoss, or voracious Zerg, in StarCraft: The Board Game you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll command an army like no other in the universe!Once again, Fantasy Flight Games brings one of the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best-loved computer games to your tabletop. Players take control of the Protoss, Terran, or Zerg and battle across multiple worlds. True to the StarCraft legacy, each of the three races features a unique and distinctive play style, and the inclusion of two distinct factions for each race allows up to six players to compete for galactic dominance at a time. Including a total of over 180 plastic figures and dozens of unit types, StarCraft: The Board Game features an innovative modular board consisting of planets of varying sizes which guarantees a new experience each and every game. An exciting card-driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target. 
This game was played only twice. All pieces are included. Box is in great condition.</notes>

    <notes>I have marked the game as acceptable only because it does have split corners (the box is very weak, bad production) BUT I have reinforced the corners inside so the box hold together very well and is split only in appearance. Some bonuses include: cases for all pieces, as well as one color of each faction is fully painted 
I accept online payment as I have a paypal account (just a personal one so you will need to send me money via you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re own account) and will accept money transfers. 
Shipping is not included, but I will work with you to figure out the best option for shipping.
This is a great game, and all pieces are in great condition, I just never get to play it and have other things I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather own.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a used copy of Starcraft the board game. Its complete and the box is in very good condition (except for some slight whitening of the corners). 
For shipping, I charge only actual shipping. It usually varies between 25$ and 35$ for a box of this size. Shipping originates from Montreal, Canada (H2W 2M7).
I will gladly combine shipping if you purchase multiple items. I can ship outside of North America, if needed, but keep in mind that shipping could be very expensive if you require tracking.
Thanks and enjoy!</notes>

ENGLISH version of Starcraft: the board game. (Fantasy Flight Games)
Outside box cover has dents, scuff marks and shelf wear
Inside box cover has some tape residue and small tear damage
Contents are complete and in (very) good condition. All components have been counted; no tearing on counters and tiles.
All figures are accounted for. Some have broken bases unfortunately. These can be superglued.
Manual has some front page curling in the bottom right corner.
All cards are sleeved.
Please see pictures.
Includes one extra Red Terran Carrier and one extra blue Terran Goliath.
Why so cheap? What is the catch?
There is no catch (except for the minor defects mentioned above). I need to make room for a babyroom, so the FFG coffin boxes have to go.
So if you are looking for this popular Out of Print game, here is your chance :)
Questions? Please message me.
This is a large and heavy box (coffin box); please be aware that shipping costs incl insurance will be around 24 euros. Please email for exact estimate.</notes>

The expansion is mixed in with the base set - to do this, I removed the base game insert and no longer have it or the expansion separate box.

This is a big honkin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; box and heavy game - I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t overcharge you on shipping, but it will be a lot.</notes>

    <notes>My copy includes the Brood war expansion.  The game was played only once.  I have meticulously arranged each faction into individual plano boxes which all fit in the original box.  It took me hours to organize this and the additional expense for the plano boxes, so I feel this is quite a bit better than new. I have the empty brood war expansion box available as well, though it will add to the shipping cost.  My asking price does not include shipping.  The origination zip code is 98105.  Many pictures are available.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game only.  This set has been opened, sorted, organized but has not been played; from a smoke free home (I received this in a trade about a year ago).  So, components are like new with two exceptions.  One yellow Protoss Corsair and one Orange Protoss Corsair ship snapped from its plastic stand (stand tip is in the ship hole).  There is one extra stand that can be used as a replacement but the second stand that broke in the ship would have to be glued together with the ship.  You may also be able to buy these types of plastic stands on line somewhere.  The box lid has one side where it is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;gouged_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - the box base is dented in at the same location but not  broken through.  A piece of mailing  tape on the inside can repair the gouge but it does not impact the box usage.  Overall, the box is in very good condition with normal scratches, rubbing and white corners from age and storage.   This is a great set for someone to actually play - I just couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get it to the table and it needs a good home.  Maybe you would like to add it to your collection.  Shipping will likely be by FedEx Ground.  This game package is 10 pounds and will be a package size of 24 x 16 x 6.  So, you can estimate the shipping for this by going to FedEx site for shipping rates from here (07436) to your location (remember to check residential address when making the estimate - it will be more than to a commercial address).  For example, to ship from here to Missouri, it would be $22.00 (thus, more to west coast and less to east coast).  Buyer to pay actual shipping and pay pal fee.</notes>

A few (about ten) flight-minis had been broken off their stands (quite common with this game) but have been glued back on. 
Shipping costs are higher than normal due to the large coffin form - 9€ in germany and 20€ to other european countries.

    <notes>The game is in a very good condition. 
A few minis have been glued (standard here). 
Everything is complete. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve counted all elements and nothing is missing.  
The box has some wear and tear.
Photos are available on request.
Shipping costs will probably be a lil bit higher, due to game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s size. My wild guess is that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll costs 12 Euro within Germany and about 20-25 to other countries. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll check it if you are interested.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible to pick the game up in Berlin and occasionally in Wroclaw (Poland).</notes>

    <notes>For sale is a copy of StarCraft the Board Game with the Brood War expansion. I do not have the box for the expansion, but all of the components are there. Everything has been checked and accounted for. This has been well taken care of and only played 6 times. The components and box are in excellent condition. Included are also several printed play aids from BGG. Shipping will be about $22 due to the size and weight of the box. I accept paypal and Venmo. I am willing to ship worldwide, but I would need to get a quote on the price. I am sure it would not be cheap. I may be willing to negotiate some on price.</notes>

    <notes>INCLUDES BROOD WAR EXPANSION.
Game is like new, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve literally never played it.  There are no broken ships.  The play mats have been laminated.  I have the box for the expansion, but all the parts fit into the primary box, organized in various plano containers (which protect the ships and will be included.)
Buyer pays actual shipping from 92078 - probably at least $20 for west coast, $35-40 for east coast.</notes>

    <notes>Starcraft: The Board Game Core Game. Everything accounted for and in very good conditions. Box has only a minor dent in one of the corners (see photo) and the cards insert was cut off (see photo). Some of the bases of the flying miniatures were broken when they were shipped to me. I have glued them and placed them in a separate small box and marked them, so they can handle the transport. They all stand with no problems.

    <notes>Reserved for BGG user hottbill.
For the most part, this game is in very good/great condition, but 5 of the models have broken off of their bases (4 of the 6 Terran ships).  It is also missing 3 counters:  1 (of 7) purple transport tokens, 1 (of 15) orange worker tokens, and 1 (of 20) depletion tokens.  
Otherwise, all components are inventoried and are in great condition.
Shipping:  This game is extremely large/heavy.  I will need to get an official quote for any buyer, but I am expecting this to be C$40+ to most US locations, and C$30+ to most Canadian addresses.</notes>

A few pieces arrived broken in my new copy (the ship was off the mount and will need to be glued on, one of the soldiers — I call him “Lefty” — is missing an arm). 
I think the pieces pictured at the top are extra? The broken ones are below.

    <notes>Base game, Brood War expansion, sealed Typhon promo planet, and 20+ extra flight bases.  
Entire game and expansion sleeved in FFG sleeves, included.  Base game played once.  Several of the minis had broken bases, common for this game but all have been replaced.  Inventoried and complete includes a plano container to hold smaller counters.  Very minor shelf wear on boxes, no blown corners 
An excellent opportunity to get a complete set of a great out of print game!
Buyer to pay actual shipping. Due to size, I cannot ship this outside the US
Local pickup in Lexington available, or Louisville/Cincy if patient 
Please GM me with any questions, I will be happy to combine shipping on any item in my marketplace, OR with any item on my trade list if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to make an offer. I REALLY need the space!

    <notes>Game is in great condition, however when counting pieces I found that there are 7 yellow Zealot minis (there should be six) and 2 yellow High Templar minis (there should be 3), so clearly FF messed up when they packaged it (they do look very similar). This is the only reason for the lower condition rating and price. Game is otherwise complete and in excellent condition.  This is a BIG box, so expect shipping to be up to $40.</notes>

    <notes>Includes Brood War Expansion in base game box (expansion box not included) as well as the Leader print and play promo cards.
Base game is opened and played with some minor wear on box and tiles.  Cards look fine.  I count 5 broken mini stands but could be reglued.  Brood War is punched, but unplayed.</notes>
