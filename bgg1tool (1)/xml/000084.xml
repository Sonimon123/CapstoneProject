   <description>Rommel in the Desert is a pre-_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Front_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game touching on the conflict between the British and Germans in North Africa during WWII. A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side. The supply system is card driven. The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fog of war_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I am selling the most recent edition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve applied the stickers but never played the game. Comes with 2 decks of order cards, because the one that came with the game were cut uneven. Complete.
Price includes shipping to US addresses only (will be slightly more for Hawaii or Alaska).
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (slower).

    <notes>Older edition.  My copy is missing a single card from the supply deck but this does not affect gameplay if one adjusts to the correct percentage of supply/non-supply cards by holding two other cards out of the deck.  All other components are present and the game is in very good condition for its age.
Shipping and Handling is $8 for US buyers.  International buyers will pay actual shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Rommel in the Desert (1982) from The Game Preserve
Box:  Outer paper slipcover has some shelfwear and a couple of small tears but overall is in very good condition.  Inner box has some wear on the exposed short ends but overall is in excellent condition!
Components:  Map sections have been taped together on the back (not sure whether it came like this originally or was taped by a previous owner).  Otherwise, components are complete and in like new condition!  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.  
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

My husband was an avid gamer and collected board games.  His profile is on BBG, under Kimbo.  He took excellent care of all his games and they are all in great condition.  He passed away in 2012, and the time has come for me to start selling games.  Please keep in mind that not all games on his list are for sale, but feel free to ask me about any of them.  Thank you

    <notes>Looks like a great game, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little more complex than I play any more.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s as close to mint condition as possible.  Game is unplayed, rulebook doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even look like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been read.  Wooden blocks have the stickers put on, otherwise it is as close to new as possible.  Buyer pays for shipping from Illinois.  Might be able to deliver to northeast Illinois.</notes>

Buyer pays postage or will deliver to Toronto (west of Yonge, south of 401) along 401 corridor to Kitchener-Waterloo (item_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s location).

    <notes>This game was never played.  However, I did place stickers on about half of the wooden counters.  Also, as a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s aid, I wrote the movement allowance for the counters on the stickers.  The rules have been heavily highlighted and underlined in red. They are pretty messy (see photo) and you would need to obtain a copy of the rules on Boardgamegeek or on another web site. The box has some shelf wear and has some crush damage in a corner.  Finally I also made several player aid markings (movement/supply) on the left side of the map.  
Please E-mail me if you have any questions about the game.
The game will be shipped within 1 to 2 business days after receiving payment via PayPal, Money Order or by Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Check. Thank you for reviewing my listing.
I will ship the game by USPS Priority Mail using a medium flat rate box at a cost of $13.45.</notes>

    <notes>The high regard so many geeks have for this game is well deserved.  This is a mint, “un-stuck” copy, with the supply cards still wrapped.
The picture is of the actual game that’s for sale – you’ll note it’s the early Columbia edition. Please write with any questions.
I only ask for actual postage.
