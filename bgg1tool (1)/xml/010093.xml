    <notes>I sell out of Elliot Lake, ONTARIO, Canada.
I feel I offer the best prices for Canadians on this website, if you find a cheaper price contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see what I can do!
Shipping within Canada is $8 for small board games (munchkin, carcassonne, settlers) $10 for medium games (shadows over camelot, arkham, talisman) and $14 for large games (WoW, Twilight Imperium, Descent) US Customers add $2. If you place an order without contacting me first, use this as a guideline for what to send for shipping I am very easy to deal with if there is an error with payment we will work something out

    <notes>     Game in near mint condition, allot of the cardboard (e.g. tokens mostly unpunched, cards still not seperated, money never used).  Played here, while working, in Fl., but, rather sell it, than have to take it back, to Latin America. Will send game parcel, to lower 48 states, with cardboard box, placed around orginal game box. Asking a flat 10.00 for postage _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; handling.
     The newer features of a gun _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; destryer-cruiser type ship, makes it more interesting than the orginal, plus optional nation advantages.</notes>

    <notes>Game is new and sealed. Never played.  Purchased it from War Store then found out about Anniversary game coming out so got that a month later from Warstore.
So this one is no longer needed.
Do not pass up your chance to get a collectable game sealed that you can sell later at a profit. Me I am going to be moving in the near future so thinning my collection down. Plus a two year old son takes up a lot of my time.
I prefer USPS Priority Mail.  If you want to go a cheaper method let me know and I can get a quote to you.
International buyers ask me for a shipping quote before purchase.</notes>

    <notes>· AXIS _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; ALLIES, 2004 Revised Edition  (Avalon Hill, 2004)  The game is in NEW condition in original factory shrink wrap. 
Buyer pays for shipping.  Cashiers Check and Money Orders accepted, PAY PAL preferred.  Payment is expected to arrive and clear before games will ship.  Shipping charges are those quoted by the USPS for shipping the item(s) (http://www.usps.com/prices/priority-mail-prices.htm).

Additional pictures furnished upon request.
Best wishes,
Jon

    <notes>Game is out of outer shrink but the actual game materials are in great shape and are still in shrink and counters are unpunched.
Unfortunately, the box top of this one has a significant blemish in the upper left quarter with an outward dishing/dent resulting in there being a warp to the box lid in that section.  Box also has some shelf and edgewear.  Bottom of box is fine.
Shipping is $10 to Eastern and Central US and $12 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>GAME DESCRIPTION: Everything in excellent condition. I sorted and bagged all the plastic pieces. Counter sheets un-punched except for one counter (which is bagged).
SHIPPING: Shipping in the U.S.A. will normally be USPS Priority Mail 2-Day Delivery (comes with tracking # and up to $50 insurance coverage). Mailing cost for most games will be around $10.00 for USA delivery. Heavier games will be more expensive, but you can choose Standard Mail (delivery time 5-7 days) to get a lower shipping cost. Send me a message with your ZIP Code to ask for a firm price. Shipping discount available for multiple items on the same order (contact me for a price). 
PACKAGING: Your game will be packaged carefully so that it arrives in the same condition as you ordered.
INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Please send me your City and Country for a shipping price quote.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Partially punched (money still in shrink wrap) but unplayed. Box has very minor shelf wear, components are in like new condition, stored in Plano boxes. No box insert (if there ever was one).
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a very large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Overall: G to VG
Box: G to VG (top is indented somewhat and is flared on the sides)
Bits: VG to LN (bagged)
The box is in good shape except for the flaring and indentation of the top.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care about that, then you should be happy with the overall condition of the game.</notes>
