   <description>Translating as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;By the Width of a Tire,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; this game covers a Tour de France-type of bicycle race.  Each player takes control of a four-member racing team, and the goal is to score as many points as possible for the whole team.  Movement is primarily handled by dice, however a limited card set partially replaces die results.  Once you add unique rules which allow riders to draft one another and multiple kinds of road surfaces, this game has much to offer race fans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Homas Tour is the original edition of the cycle racing game later known as Um Reifenbreite. Many copies of the original game were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1979. The combination of its sudden rarity and recognition as a good game meant that Homas Tour was (and is) very desirable, particularly to collectors. Everyone else can save their money and enjoy Um Reifenbreite!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Brand new still in shrink wrap Jumbo edition. This is a German language edition.
I accept PayPal transfers. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t accept PayPal credit card payments. For international orders PayPal transfers (not credit cards) are strongly preferred but I will accept checks in USD drawn on a US bank. There may be additional shipping delays for international orders paid by check as I wait for the check to clear.
Buyer pays actual shipping charges for US addresses. International orders will incur a $2 handling fee. I will ship game within 1 business day of receiving payment, unless payment is by personal check. Personal checks will delay shipping by upto 7-10 business days after check arrives. I will combine shipping on multiple orders to lower overall shipping charges.

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Game has never been played - cards still in shrink.  Original game rules are German, but an English translation of the rules is provided. 
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more. </notes>

The game appears unplayed. Look at the cards. But it shows on the board and on at least 2 driver traces of stain. 
There is no smell. How that happened I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t imagine.
So the game is like new and only acceptable at the same time. Please rule for yourself with the help of the many pictures.</notes>

    <notes>We liked this game so much that we bought the 10th Anniversary edition.  I am selling our copy that is the edition with the SDJ logo on the cover.  I will describe the condition of the game, but if you have any specific questions please email.  The box is in very good condition - just normal shelf wear.  The board, bike playing pieces, scorepad (we didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use it) and the dice are all in very good condition.  The only components that show wear are the energy cards.  Most of the cards just have normal wear, but a few have creasing.  It didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay for us but if you want all of the cards to be crisp then you will not be happy with this copy.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

Überweisung oder Paypal akzeptiere ich als Zahlungsoptionen. 
Ich versende weltweit. Der Käufer trägt die Versandgebühren. 
Innerhalb Deutschlands oder Europas versende ich gerne mit der Post als Paket

für 3,95€ bis 1kg bzw. 4,40€ bis 2kg.
Für andere Versandwünsche, bitte nachfragen.

    <notes>Um Reifenbreite, instructions in German but game is language-independent once you read the rules in the language of your choice. The box has one split corner but the game itself is in great condition, everything intact, just one sheet on the scoresheet used. The shipping cost within Germany would be 4.99€ as a DHL Paket (insured). If you live in Berlin you can come by and pick it up.</notes>

    <notes>This is the German _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;10 Jahre_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; edition in beautiful condition! I did paste up the cards, however, so this is a terrific copy for someone who uses English instead of German while gaming, but a bad copy for someone who would like the game in untouched condition.
