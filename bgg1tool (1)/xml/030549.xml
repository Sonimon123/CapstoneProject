   <description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;normal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; spread of the infections._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

A truly cooperative game where all players represent members of a team of experts that must find the cure to four virulent diseases before they wipe out the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s population. A very tense-filled game.
Components: 1 board, 96 wooden cubes (for diseases), 5 pawns, 6 wooden research stations, 6 markers: 1 outbreak marker, 1 infection rate marker, and 4 cure markers, 115 Cards: 48 infection cards, 59 player cards, 4 role cards, and 4 quick reference cards.

    <notes>I am selling my copy of Pandemic.  It has only been played twice, and everything is in like-new condition.  
This is the 1st edition, and all the correct cards/tokens/pieces are accounted for and in excellent shape.  I have all the game components bagged up since the box insert is the most useless insert I have ever seen, but I did not throw away the insert so I guess you can judge for yourself.  ;)
I try to be as detailed as possible in my descriptions, so I am including a picture of a half-of-a-grain-of-rice sized ding on the side of the box cover that was there the day I got it.  The ding is hard to see, but I tried to capture it as best I could with my camera.
I will accept payment by PayPal from a verified address/account.  I am asking for $20 plus $10 to ship in the USA (from southern California) by Priority Mail with tracking.  I would prefer a non-credit card payment so I can skip the PayPal fee - if you pay by credit card, then the price is $21 plus $10 shipping.
I have no problem with international shipping if you have sufficient positive feedback ratings, but we will have to work out shipping costs separately.  
I will generally ship same day if I get your payment before 1:00 PM Pacific or so.  
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Designed by Matt Leacock
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out. 
Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. 
But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. 
A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose. 
Pandemic is also in these languages: French and German.
Contents: board, 96 wooden cubes (for diseases), 5 pawns, 6 wooden research stations,
6 markers: 1 outbreak marker, 1 infection rate marker, and 4 cure markers, 115 Cards: 48 infection cards, 59 player cards, 4 role cards, and 4 quick reference cards
No. of players: 2-4
Ages: 10+

    <notes>You are specialists at the CDC/Atlanta where you watch several virulent diseases break out simultaneously all over the world. The team mission is to prevent a world-wide pandemic outbreak, treating hotspots while researching cures for each of the four plagues before they get out of hand.
Players must plan their strategy to mesh their specialist_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s strengths before the diseases overwhelm the world. For example, the Operations Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. But the diseases are breaking out fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while developing cures. If disease spreads uncontrolled, the players all lose. If they can cure all four diseases, they win.
The board shows earth with some big population centres. On each turn a player can use four actions to travel, cure, discover and build. Cards are used for this but the deck also contains Epidemics...
Shipping inside the United States is $10.00.  Please Email us for shipping rates out of the US.  </notes>

    <notes>We played this a few times, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in excellent condition.  All the pieces are present and bagged.  This game comes from a non-smoking home.  
The box has some very minor surface scratches, but no worse than you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d see on a store shelf.  The instructions have a few small wrinkles from reading, but there are no creases.  The cards have been shuffled, so they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t perfectly flat, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be hard pressed to notice.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Designed by Matt Leacock
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out. 
Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. 
But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. 
A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose. 
Pandemic is also in these languages: French and German.
Contents: board, 96 wooden cubes (for diseases), 5 pawns, 6 wooden research stations,
6 markers: 1 outbreak marker, 1 infection rate marker, and 4 cure markers, 115 Cards: 48 infection cards, 59 player cards, 4 role cards, and 4 quick reference cards
No. of players: 2-4
Ages: 10+
Playing time: 45-60 minutes

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Designed by Matt Leacock
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out. 
Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. 
But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. 
A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose. 
Pandemic is also in these languages: French and German.
Contents: board, 96 wooden cubes (for diseases), 5 pawns, 6 wooden research stations,
6 markers: 1 outbreak marker, 1 infection rate marker, and 4 cure markers, 115 Cards: 48 infection cards, 59 player cards, 4 role cards, and 4 quick reference cards
No. of players: 2-4
Ages: 10+
Playing time: 45-60 minutes

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Designed by Matt Leacock
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out. 
Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. 
But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. 
A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose. 
Pandemic is also in these languages: French and German.
Contents: board, 96 wooden cubes (for diseases), 5 pawns, 6 wooden research stations,
6 markers: 1 outbreak marker, 1 infection rate marker, and 4 cure markers, 115 Cards: 48 infection cards, 59 player cards, 4 role cards, and 4 quick reference cards
No. of players: 2-4
Ages: 10+
Playing time: 45-60 minutes

    <notes>Hi guys, new copy of Pandemic with the On the Brink expansion.  All components complete except for the petri dishes; I put all of the components into the base game box and threw away the box for the expansion and I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t manage to fit the petri dishes in (you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them to play the game).  Otherwise all components in pristine condition as if the shrink just came off, both the base game and the expansion. I want someone else to enjoy it since its collecting dust in my house, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it cheap, both combined can run you up to $40, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling them together for $15! hope you fun with this game!</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out.
Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5.
But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures.
A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose.</notes>

    <notes>This is for Pandemic and the Pandemic: On the Brink expansion.  Both the base game and the expansion are in the Pandemic box.  Upon request, I will ship the Pandemic: On the Brink expansion box together with the game.  This should not increase shipping costs.
The game is complete and in great condition.  It has been played a few times, but there is no visible wear.
The shipping weight is 3 lb 7 oz, and it will be shipped from zipcode 38501.  Using USPS Parcel Post, the shipping will be $6.40 - 10.86, depending on destination.
Please contact me for an exact shipping quote. I am willing to use any carrier and any service, just let me know your preference and I will bill you the exact shipping amount.  If no carrier/service is specified, I will default to USPS Parcel post, since it tends to be cheapest for single games.
I am willing to combine shipping for multiple games. You will be billed the exact shipping amount.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out. 
Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. 
But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. 
A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose. </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7021)
Four diseases have broken out in the world and it is up to a team of specialists in various fields to find cures for these diseases before mankind is wiped out.  Players must work together, playing to their characters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strengths and planning their strategy of eradication before the diseases overwhelm the world with ever-increasing outbreaks. For example, the Operation Specialist can build research stations, which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5.  But the diseases are outbreaking fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while also towards cures. A truly cooperative game where you all win or you all lose.  </notes>

We only sell brand new, unopened games - so this game will be delivered to you directly from our warehouse as if you had ordered directly from our online store.
Postal Charges are determined by the weight of the item(s) so if you want to buy more than one game we will work out the postal charges based on the combined weight (which could add to your savings).
Post within the UK for this game:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 3-7 Day Delivery = £4.75
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 2-3 Day Delivery = £7.40
We also offer a Collect+ Service (for £3.99 for order up to 10kg - typically 3 or 4 games!!) to most areas - in which we send your parcel to one of your local shops that act as a collection centre for this service.  You simply have to pick up your parcel within 10 days of receiving a message telling you it awaits collection (typically within 3-5 days of dispatch).  We can tell you more if you are interested.
Strategy Board _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Card Games is just one of the sections of our online shop that are designed to challenge you to ThinkSomeMore - so you can rest assured you are going to receive a quality product, carefully packaged and dispatched at a great price - from professional service.

    <notes>RESERVED FOR AUCTION WINNER SANCHEZJA
2007 Zman Games. Played a few times, cards are sleeved. 
Also in this listing is the On the Brink expansion, used once.
All the stuff to these games are in both boxes, but may not be in the corresponding box. For example, I think I have a couple virus petri dishes in the main box. Everything is in excellent condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also included the THREAT LEVEL SIX fan-made expansion, printed through Arts Cow. Excellent condition.

    <notes>The box and game board appear to have minor surface markings throughout, just a by-product of the finish they decided to use.  One corner of the back of the box appears smashed.  Please see images here if you are concerned, but I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice them until looking things over prior to putting this ad up.  Please note that while one edge of the game board looks like it is ripped up, that is just the art on the game board.

    <notes>[b]Condition: [/b] Very good condition! Game was missing a yellow cube when I got it. I made a wooden cube and painted it yellow but the shade isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t an exact match.
[b]Shipping:[/b] Ships from zipcode 70003 if you wish to check shipping prices. The shipping weight is at least 3 lbs, it can fit fine in a medium USPS flat rate box with room to spare for bubble wrap. Can most definitely ship for cheaper than the medium flat rate box however depending on your location. 
[b]Payment: [/b] Amazon: Gift Card is fine for payment.
Paypal: To be sent as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to avoid fees.
Please leave feedback after receiving your game and I shall do the same, thank you!</notes>

This is both the original version of Pandemic plus the expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;On the Brink_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. I am selling them only together as the expansion requires using a sticker to modify the bored for a fifth disease which has been stuck on the board (refer to the pictures or ask for more information). The two games have been used a few times but all parts are in excellent condition and nothing is missing and will be shipped in the two individual boxes.
Also includes two expansions Pandemic: State of Emergency (English first edition) (2015) and Pandemic: In the Lab (English first edition) (2013).</notes>

    <notes>FULL package:**Base game + on the brink + in the lab**
I combined all content into one box. If you prefer, I can ship all 3 boxes too but shipping fee is going to be more expensive.
Played twice. All components complete and in great condition. Image available upon request.
Flat shipping fee $13 (or $18 if you want 3 boxes) for Continental USA. Free shipping with purchase of $150+. 
Combined shipping available. Also available for pick up in NYC.
I accept Paypal, Venmo, Google wallet and Chase Quickpay.
Price is negotiable if you buy multiple games. 
I will consider international shipping if USPS can ship to the country. The rate would be based on the flat rate packages on USPS website (plus $3 to buy insurance if the value is bigger than $50). Shipping to China is $9/lb.</notes>

    <notes>The price listed includes the BASE GAME, along with ON THE BRINK, and IN THE LAB. The base game and ON THE BRINK fit into the base game box but has the insert from ON THE BRINK (which is far much better than the original). IN THE LAB comes with its own box. In the lab is opened but never played. All components and boxes are very gently handled. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to combine shipping if interested in any of my other games. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m can also take pictures if at all requested. Buyer pays actual shipping costs from 55811. Feel free to shoot me any PM_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s if you have any questions, thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Spiel ist in sehr gutem Zustand. Es war allerdings mal ein Büchereispiel - keine Ahnung, warum die es ausgemustert haben, am Zustand kann es jedenfalls nicht liegen. So, was bedeutet das jetzt konkret? Zunächst mal ist die Box laminiert worden, was ja schon mal ganz gut ist. Auf dem Deckel der Box ist ein etwa 5*3 cm großer Aufkleber mit einlaminiert, auf dem unter anderem der ehemalige Scancode der Bücherei drauf ist. Auf der Innenseite des Deckels ist eine Liste der Spielteile eingeklebt und ein Stempel, dass das Spiel aussortiert wurde. Man kann dort auch sehen, dass nur eine Ausleihe des Spieles eingetragen wurde. Auf der Anleitung ist auch ein Stempel. Das gesamte Spielmaterial selbst ist ohne Beklebungen etc. und vollkommen in Ordnung.</notes>

    <notes>2014/2015 printing. Very good condition. Some light card wear (mostly a tiny bit of whitening on the card corners), but otherwise like-new.
Buyer pays shipping from 19711.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a pretty small box, so shipping should be reasonable.  I can typically get better rates that flat-rate prices, so PM me with a zip code if you want a shipping quote.</notes>
