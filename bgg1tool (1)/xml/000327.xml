   <description>In Loopin' Louie, a battery-powered motor placed in the center of the table rotates a boom with a little plastic plane. Four radial arms lead out to the players' barns and the chickens they're trying to protect. Each barn has a little lever, which is used to knock the rotating plane away from your chickens and hopefully into someone else's. When only one player has chickens remaining, he or she wins the game. Very silly and very addictive._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Extremely similar versions of the game, but with different themes, are available._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>box shows minor wears, inside is mint. Components in excellent shape, of course complete and 100% working. French version of the gale, but apart from the title on the box, the game is language independant.
Will take cash if buyer pays the charges, or cash.</notes>

    <notes>Works perfectly.  Components are in excellent condition and complete except that the instructions are missing (should be available on Hasbro_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s web site) and there are 12 chicken tokens (all you need for all 4 players, but the game originally came with 1 extra).  Box has clear tape around it and moderate wear to the edges and corners.</notes>

Box: Light shelf-wear and few minor dings, dents, and wrinkles. The flap where the box opens doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stay shut very well (a common problem with these kinds of boxes). Overall the box is in very good+ condition!
Contents: Complete and in like new condition! The rules are a little beat up from moving around the box, but they are in great shape otherwise. I have tested the motor and it works perfectly!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

The box isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t so much beat up as has been made slightly strangely - the edge folds aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t in exactly the right place, so it looks a bit creased and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t form a rigid box when closed.  But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shiny new and the contents are perfect.

    <notes>This is the old 1993 Milton Bradley big box American version.
No instructions, box is definitely in rough shape with one end taped, but the game components are 100% complete (all discs present) and look and work just fine. (I installed a battery to check and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll it in there.)
You will not get hosed on shipping! I use Priority _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Regional Rate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; boxes and Parcel Post to save $$$. Big packages can work out to $2-3 per game!
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I take USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept standard Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments under the following terms: Your grand total will include a surcharge sufficient to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after I pay Paypal their fees, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the full purchase price, INCLUDING the shipping.
I also am happy to take ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price plus exact postage. Sending a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment means you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be trusting your seller (i.e. me), which is no different than the way every mail order transaction EVER worked prior to 1998 or so.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, click the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tab, and then make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees [and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see why sellers hate paypal fees so darn much].)</notes>

    <notes>1992 edition by Milton Bradley (the larger sized one)
Game is in very good condition and has been tested - works great! Batteries are included and the battery cover is present. Missing the rules but they can be found online. It has 10 out of 12 chicken tokens, some of which do not have the chicken sticker on it but that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect game play. Note: Each player needs 3 tokens so you can play up to 3 players. You can usually find replacements sold online if you wish to be able to play with 4 players. Box does have moderate wear but overall the box is fine and serves its purpose
