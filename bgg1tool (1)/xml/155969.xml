   <description>Dockmaster Schlibble and Constable O'Brady cordially invite you to visit their bustling Harbour town! Attend to business at the Trader's Guild or the Masoner's Hall. Break for lunch at the Sushi Shop, or stop off for a drink at the Pub. Don't forget to check out the Wizard's Traveling Imaginarium before you go! But no matter where you go, keep on the lookout for a bargain... the denizens of this town are always wheeling and dealing! Collect and trade resources as you visit the various buildings of Harbour, and cash them in to buy your way into the town. Whoever has the most points worth of buildings when the game ends, wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Harbour is a worker placement game where players move their worker from building to building, collecting and trading Fish, Livestock, Wood, and Stone; and cashing those resources in to purchase buildings (which are the worker placement spots) from the central pool. Once a building is purchased, it is replaced from the deck, and the central pool is a small subset of the deck, and is therefore different every game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game ends when a player has purchased his fourth building. After that round finishes, the player with the most points worth of buildings is the winner!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the heart of Harbour is a dynamic market mechanism. Each time a player purchases a building, the value of the resources they used drops, while the value of the other resources rise. You'll have to carefully time your purchases to take advantage of the ebb and flow of market prices, or be prepared to waste some resources!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

[b]HARBOUR - KICKSTARTER EDITION BY SCOTT ALMES
BRAND-NEW, SEALED BOX, IN-HAND AND READY TO SHIP - NOT A PRE-ORDER!!![/b]
This Game Includes All Stretch Goals and Exclusives Including a New Belford Guild Promo Pack of Cards!!!
[b][u]LIMITED LAUNCH EXCLUSIVE CHARACTERS and OTHER GREAT BONUS STUFF:[/u]
• Fisherman - When you collect any fish, gain an additional fish. 
• Wholesailer - When buying a building, keep 1 of each good sold. 
• Noble -  At the beginning of the game, look at the top 2 building cards and build 1 of them for no cost. It is worth $0 and 0 VP,  
   and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t count towards the 4 to trigger the game end. 
• Mason - When anybody uses stone to buy, collect 1 stone.
• Speculator - At the end of the game, add VP to your total building worth equal to the current market value of stone. 
• Beggar - When another player gains goods from their character action, you gain 1 good of your choice.
Custom Meeples!!!
Belfort EXCLUSIVE Guild Promo Pack#1
Solo Player _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Training Dummy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Character Card and Rules
UV Protection Film on Box Cover
Bonus Buildings:
• Floating Dock - gets you two fish, but if you have or are tied for the most anchors you get a fish and one of your choice. It has a 
  Top Hat and a Warehouse connected to it!
• Clocktower - pay one good and then on your next turn, double the action you perform. This can make for some big moves in 
  the late game. I should note, however, there was a reason this was the last stretch goal—it brings with it a ton of rules and 
  timing questions. For whom does the bell toll? It tolls for its own FAQ once the game is available.
Victory Lap Care for the winner - special silly rules for the winner to do!!![/b]

[b]HARBOUR - KICKSTARTER EDITION BY SCOTT ALMES
BRAND-NEW, SEALED BOX, IN-HAND AND READY TO SHIP - NOT A PRE-ORDER!!![/b]
This Game Includes All Stretch Goals and Exclusives Including a New Belford Guild Promo Pack of Cards!!!
[b][u]LIMITED LAUNCH EXCLUSIVE CHARACTERS and OTHER GREAT BONUS STUFF:[/u]
• Fisherman - When you collect any fish, gain an additional fish. 
• Wholesailer - When buying a building, keep 1 of each good sold. 
• Noble -  At the beginning of the game, look at the top 2 building cards and build 1 of them for no cost. It is worth $0 and 0 VP,  
   and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t count towards the 4 to trigger the game end. 
• Mason - When anybody uses stone to buy, collect 1 stone.
• Speculator - At the end of the game, add VP to your total building worth equal to the current market value of stone. 
• Beggar - When another player gains goods from their character action, you gain 1 good of your choice.
Custom Meeples!!!
Belfort EXCLUSIVE Guild Promo Pack#1
Solo Player _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Training Dummy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Character Card and Rules
UV Protection Film on Box Cover
Bonus Buildings:
• Floating Dock - gets you two fish, but if you have or are tied for the most anchors you get a fish and one of your choice. It has a 
  Top Hat and a Warehouse connected to it!
• Clocktower - pay one good and then on your next turn, double the action you perform. This can make for some big moves in 
  the late game. I should note, however, there was a reason this was the last stretch goal—it brings with it a ton of rules and 
  timing questions. For whom does the bell toll? It tolls for its own FAQ once the game is available.

The buyer will pay all shipping costs. Expect international shipping costs to be very high. I will try to find the cheapest and safest option to ship to your location. Combined shipping is possible with my other items for sale. Free local pickup in Paris and surroundings, is available and encouraged.
Wire transfer in the euro zone is accepted as payment.
Feel free to make me an offer if you think my price on this item is too high or if you would like to buy multiple items from me. I will not be offended by any offer, but I reserve the right to turn it down.</notes>

Please do not purchase if you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t win this auction.
- Games are shipped via USPS Priority Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise, at which point we can discuss shipping. 
- I exclusively use PayPal and PayPal invoices. Please do not pay me until I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sent you an invoice. 
This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail. </notes>
