   <description>In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster! Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

In the game of Rampage players each control one of the four monsters and their objective is to cause the most damage to the city while eating the Meeple citizens. Each turn consists of choosing two actions to complete. These actions include: Movement, Attack a Building, Hurl a truck, or Monster Breath. Eating Meeples does not take an action, however, players are limited each turn by the number of teeth their monster has remaining. The game ends when the buildings are destroyed. Buildings, Meeples eaten, and the Other Monster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Teeth are worth points. To be victorious, players will need to use a combination of dexterity, planning, and luck. </notes>

Buildings, Meeples eaten, and the Other Monster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Teeth are worth points. To be victorious, players will need to use a combination of dexterity, planning, and luck. </notes>

Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMRAM01)
 In the game of Rampage players each control one of the four monsters and their objective is to cause the most damage to the city while eating the Meeple citizens. Each turn consists of choosing two actions to complete. These actions include: Movement, Attack a Building, Hurl a truck, or Monster Breath. Eating Meeples does not take an action, however, players are limited each turn by the number of teeth their monster has remaining. The game ends when the buildings are destroyed. Buildings, Meeples eaten, and the Other Monster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Teeth are worth points. To be victorious, players will need to use a combination of dexterity, planning, and luck.

    <notes>1st English editon of Rampage, It is great condition played about 4 times. One of the red meeples has a chunk out of it , this was how it came and I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t requested a replacement as it does not affect game play and I thought it was quite  thematic.
Shipping the UK for £8 via my hermes with Signature. If you would like another postage option or need postage overseas let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll work out a price for shipping.
Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the Rampage edition.  The components are partially punched, but the game was never played.  The cards are still shrinkwrapped.  The stickers were carefully placed on the meeples.  The monsters do not have the stickers on them yet.  And I never removed the board components from the box.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>Includes all official Meeple Stickers (sold originally in the Geek Store) and Space Cowboys ([url]https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/150100/terror-meeple-city-space-cowboys[/url]) Expansion.
I purchased it new in 2013, and have played about 10 times.
All components and box in like-new shape EXCEPT something was dropped on the lid and made a small tear/puncture (about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long).  No missing material so no risk of anything falling out, essentially just cosmetic blemish.

There is some minor wear on the box lid, more of a detachment of the cover in some spots.
