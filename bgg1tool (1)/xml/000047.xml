   <description>This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Alea Chinatown.  As far as I can tell, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played once (the ownership markers were still sealed before I played it once).  The box has some wear on it, but the components are pristine.
I bought this game at Essen 2007 for €55; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not trying to make money, just to break even.  :-)
Buyer pays $10 USPS Priority shipping with confirmation and insurance.</notes>

Shipping weight is 3lb 15oz. Box is too large to fit in any of the USPS flat rate boxes, so this will ship FedEx Home Delivery. Rates will depend on where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re located, but as an example, shipping to Ohio would be $10. You can email for a quote, or check www.fedex.com.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original Alea edition in Very Good condition.  Says #2 on the side of the box.  Box shows some shelf wear, pretty light.  Components are beautiful, look unplayed.  Everything has been counted, all 150+ chips and every piece of money, etc...  Everything is guaranteed to be there, or I will personally replace it from my own set.  
Shipping is the responsibility of the buyer, I only charge actual shipping.  If you are not sure how much shipping is, ask me before buying.  I ship by USPS Priority Mail from Zip Code 09139.  Shipping to anywhere in the U.S. guaranteed not to exceed $10.</notes>

    <notes>I have a Filosofia French copy for sale. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in shrink.
For English-speaking players, all components are language-neutral, meaning that there are no words on them.
The parts that are in French are the box (with French description at the back), the rulebook and player aids. All the material can be found here on BGG translated into English.
The game is stored in a pet-free and smoke-free home.</notes>

I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.

    <notes>Z-Man games edition
Very slight bow to box top. Rulebook is in good to very good condition. Board, tokens, cards, and tiles are all in excellent condition. This comes with a few Business Outlook cards (as were present in the Alea version) printed by Artscow. Unfortunately I messed up and only made eight (instead of nine) Business Outlook cards -- there are only two (instead of three) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;no bonus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll still work for the variant, but the probabilities will be a little different.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. (And you should know that this game is a bit too long to fit in a flat rate mailing box.) That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

If you wish to send the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;personal gift_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; using a credit card as the payment source (instead of a bank account or paypal account balance), you must pay the paypal fees that will be charged.

    <notes>Perfect condition, unplayed, bonus laminated reference material, optional Plano case to store components (see picture and add $9 if you want the case).
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the storage container included and add the additional price. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for 73oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Chinatown
Description: Chinatown (Z-Man English version) brand new and still in shrinkwrap.
Shipping Weight: 5 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE ON ONE SIDE.
Contents: One copy of Chinatown, Heidelberger Spieleverlag German 2nd edition.  Game is completely language independent and I will laser print you a nice rule booklet in English.
Condition: New in shrink.  SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE ON ONE SIDE.  There is a crease running a long the long edge of the bottom of the box as if someone pushed the side of the box during shipping, causing the crease.
Shipping: This game weighs 5 pounds. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice between USPS Priority Mail and USPS Parcel Post (both are insured and delivery confirmed). For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $15 depending on how far you are from Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders.
Just so we are clear, there is a SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE ON ONE SIDE.</notes>

    <notes>THIS GAME HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.
Contents: One copy of Chinatown, Heidelberger Spieleverlag German 2nd edition. Chinatown is completely language independent and I will laser print you a nice rule booklet in English.
Condition: New in shrink. THIS GAME HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE, a result of poor packaging when the game was originally sent to me. The best way I can describe it is that there is some white showing on two of the corners of the box lid from scuffing or compression.  One corner of the bottom of the box has a mild 6-inch crease (from compression) that you can feel but hardly see.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m making this sound worse than it is because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want a buyer coming back later and saying that I was untruthful somehow!
Shipping: This game weighs 5 pounds. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice between USPS Priority Mail and USPS Parcel Post (both are insured and delivery confirmed). For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $15 depending on how far you are from Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders.
Just so we are clear, this game is in shrink, and there is a SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.</notes>

    <notes>In shrink wrap.  I purchased it around 2010 and have never had a chance to play it!  It comes from a smoke free home, and I am the sole owner.   The game weighs 3 pounds, 3.8 ounces.  After packing, the shipping weight should be just under 4 pounds.  I will be shipping via USPS Priority Mail from zip code 68005 (Nebraska) so you can estimate shipping from the USPS.com web site.  It will be in the $12-$16 range though, based on similar games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold in the past.</notes>

    <notes>Selling Chinatown (2014, most recent printing).
Shipping is from the DC metro area. Also available for local pickup.
This game is like new and played once. There is a 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tear along the upper left corner lid edge but the box structure is not damaged or crushed in any way. The box corners and edges are otherwise un-scuffed. All components are bagged and accounted for. This game is currently out of print from what I understand. Feel free to ask for a picture of it.
Payment for the game is expected via Paypal within a week of the invoice being sent.
Shipping costs are done according to what is cheapest for the buyer. Typically, this will be via USPS Priority Mail flat rate box which includes a tracking #. The shipping weight of this item is ~3 lbs.</notes>

    <notes>This is a previously copy of Chinatown that has been played approximately 5 times.  I removed the sleeves on the money cards because they had gotten a little sticky over time.  I re-sleeved the plot cards with premium sleeves, but they are about 2mm long to ensure better protection for the cards.  With the sleeves, the cards all feel and appear like new.  There is no insert.
Extras include
- custom drawstring bag that I had made to hold the tokens
- Bonus cards that I had made since was included in the old Alea version, but not the newer versions.  These cards are sleeved with premium Ultra Pro sleeves

    <notes>Whitening on the corners, some scuffs on the box and one slightly crunched corner. The game is complete otherwise with near perfect components... 
This version has a pretty big box but I think the bigger board and bigger tiles makes for a better overall player experience.
