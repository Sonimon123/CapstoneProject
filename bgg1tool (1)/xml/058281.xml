   <description>NOTE:This entry is currently in flux! All of the forum posts, and linked items are being moved to the individual game entries, with anything sufficiently generic being linked to the Summoner Wars Master Set. All content will be maintained._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But the war doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: This entry in the BGG database is used to consolidate questions and discussion regarding the Summoner Wars series; it does not correspond to a particular box or deck of the Summoner Wars game. For the base Starter Set releases, refer to BGG entries for Summoner Wars: Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs and Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs Cave Goblins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Complete Summoner Wars Collection _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; more with lots of extras!!!  Please see complete list below:
This is EVERYTHING that has been printed to date through the Alliances Master Set!
Everything is the latest edition/printing...so no cards will have the inferior quality or inconsistent sizes!!!
This collection is brand NEW and still factory SEALED! 
Base Sets:
- Original Master Set
- Alliances Master Set (Signed by Colby!!!)
- Phoenix Elves v. Tundra Orcs Starter Set
- Guild Dwarves v. Cave Goblins Starter Set
Original Faction Packs:

Note- There are roughly 1500 cards (brand new and sealed) in the listing above.  The additional 500 sleeves in this listing will be enough to cover the remainder of the 2nd Summoner Faction Packs when they are released and still have some extras in case you need/want them.

Phoenix Elves vs. Tundra Orcs (with Grungor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Charge reinforcement pack) in its original box, Guild Dwarves vs, Cave Goblins (with Rukar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Power reinforcement pack) in its original box, Fallen Kingdom faction deck, Jungle Elves Faction deck,
Mercenaries faction deck, and Vanguards faction deck.  Original white dice have been replaced with colored Chessex dice that felt more thematic.  There are 2 paper maps and also the 2-piece game board map.
Note: Original white dice not included, must have gotten rid of them.  I would include 3 sets of 5 colored Chessex dice and 1 set of 5 white Chessex dice.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink. 
You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>The item I am selling is a complete set of 40 Summoner Wars faction decks, all in excellent condition (a few of the cards have slight wear on the edges, but the majority have hardly been touched); the counters, dice, etc. included with the revised PE vs. TO and GD vs. CG starters; the storage box, rubber playmat (a little squashed, but still perfectly usable), rulebook and accessories that come with the Alliances Master Set; the playmat included with the original print run (non-revised) Master Set; and all four promo Mercenary Champions (Khan Queso, Khexhu, Bodgan and Sairook), each one in excellent condition. The eight reinforcement packs are not included.
The cards all have the revised treatment, with a smooth coating that allows for easy shuffling and less chance of cardboard cuts, though I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t had the chance to play the game more than a couple of times outside of the app (being socially awkward when meeting people kind of has its drawbacks). I intend to sell the collection with everything sorted inside the Alliances box (except for the playmats, which need to be separate).</notes>
