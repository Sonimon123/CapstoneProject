A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Europe1940 is opened, but cardboard counters are unpunched. All minis are sorted and bagged and all components are included. A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Pacific1940 is opened, and all minis and counters are bagged and sorted.
Combine both games for an epic WW2 experience! A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Europe1940 contains new rules for combining both games including new victory conditions and weapons research.
And for the first time.. new French units ( w/ new sculpts!)
Also, note that a new, corrected battleboard and additional Tac bombers for Japan were added after I requested these from WOTC, so no need to order corrected/missing pieces (see A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Pacific1940 forum for more info). 
In short, you get both games in like new condition at a substantial discount( retail= $80-$90 each + S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H!! )
I will carefully  ship both together within 24-48 hrs of recieving payment. I would love to keep both, but unfortunately I need the $ right now ;(
 Hurry, this deal won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t last long!</notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC 255240000)
With the invasion of the Low Countries and the allied evacuation from Dunkirk, the German army is poised to march on Paris. Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Europe 1940, designed and developed by Larry Harris, builds on the success of the acclaimed A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Anniversary Edition. France appears for the first time in Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies and will represent a new playable ally! Italy will be included as a second Axis power along with Germany. The UK, USSR and the US find themselves vulnerable at this early and uncertain point of the war. Two new combat units that debuted in Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific 1940, Tactical Bombers and Mechanized Infantry, will also appear in this game. 
Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Europe 1940 will feature an oversized board that measures 35_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; wide by 32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; high. With over 550 combat units, deluxe game components and local storage boxes, this game will raise the standard established by A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Anniversary Edition. All new rules for neutral nations, naval _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; air bases, and convoy disruption will add even more depth and historical accuracy to this giant game.
Finally, this deluxe theater-level game is designed to play together with Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific 1940. Together these two games will create the greatest Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies experience to date, with a combined board measuring 5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; wide by 32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; high and over a thousand sculptured combat units. Both games are designed to play alone or together to offer the 2-6 player global 1940 scenario, complete with weapons development, and national objectives.

    <notes>In like NEW/perfect condition and never played. Opened the box due to rumors that certain copies were not complete...its a good thing I inventoried the game as some parts were missing. I contacted AH and they sent me replacements for the missing parts.
This game is 100% complete and in unplayed, MINT condition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just been sitting undisturbed on my shelf collecting dust since its release (even the box itself looks immaculate with no wear, dents, dings, etc). 
BONUS opportunity to the buyer of A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;AE40: 
I also have Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific 1940 in the EXACT same condition as the above game. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to purchase it with the Europe 1940 to save on shipping and also so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have both theaters, I will let it go for ONLY $49.95!!!
Stored w/care in a smoke free home.

Europe 1940 is in great shape.  No wear except for minor shelf wear on box bottom.  All contents present and looking sweet.  I played it once.  Awesome out-of-print game, but I have to make more space for other things.
Pacific 1940 also included.  In great shape except for two split corners on box top.
Smoke-free, pet-free.  Shipping is free.
Thanks,
Mike</notes>

Second Edition
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s spring 1942, and the world is at war. Five major powers struggle for supremacy: Germany and Japan are aligned against the great alliance of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Designed for 2-5 players, the game is set in 1942 - the historical high-water mark of Axis expansion. Controlling one of the Axis or Allied powers, players will command both their country_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s military forces and its war-time economy, with the chance to plan attacks, marshal forces into embattled territories, and resolve conflicts. Victory will go to the side that conquers its opponents on the field of battle and liberates or occupies the greatest cities of the world. Change the course of history in a few short hours! </notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for 115oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOCA06270000)
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s spring 1942, and the world is at war. Five major powers struggle for supremacy: Germany and Japan are aligned against the great alliance of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Designed for 2-5 players, the game is set in 1942 - the historical high-water mark of Axis expansion. Controlling one of the Axis or Allied powers, players will command both their country_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s military forces and its war-time economy, with the chance to plan attacks, marshal forces into embattled territories, and resolve conflicts. Victory will go to the side that conquers its opponents on the field of battle and liberates or occupies the greatest cities of the world. Change the course of history in a few short hours! </notes>
