Good Cop Bad Cop is a 54-card hidden identity, deduction, and bluffing game in which each player receives multiple cards that together determine their role. Players attempt to figure out who is on their team and who is against them so they can take out their opposition, but since their opponents will be looking to do the same thing, they often must act quickly to make critical decisions with limited information. Good Cop Bad Cop focuses heavily on player interaction. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mechanics set the stage for distrust, confusion, and manipulation that results in uproarious laughter and outrageous accusations. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this extremely rich player interaction that allows Good Cop Bad Cop to use a player elimination mechanic while keeping those who get knocked out involved in the conversation and invested in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s outcome.</notes>

Good Cop Bad Cop is a 54-card hidden identity, deduction, and bluffing game in which each player receives multiple cards that together determine their role. Players attempt to figure out who is on their team and who is against them so they can take out their opposition, but since their opponents will be looking to do the same thing, they often must act quickly to make critical decisions with limited information. Good Cop Bad Cop focuses heavily on player interaction. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mechanics set the stage for distrust, confusion, and manipulation that results in uproarious laughter and outrageous accusations. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this extremely rich player interaction that allows Good Cop Bad Cop to use a player elimination mechanic while keeping those who get knocked out involved in the conversation and invested in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s outcome.</notes>

    <notes>Overworld Games (OWG0301)
Good Cop Bad Cop is a 54-card hidden identity, deduction, and bluffing game in which each player receives multiple cards that together determine their role. Players attempt to figure out who is on their team and who is against them so they can take out their opposition, but since their opponents will be looking to do the same thing, they often must act quickly to make critical decisions with limited information. Good Cop Bad Cop focuses heavily on player interaction. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mechanics set the stage for distrust, confusion, and manipulation that results in uproarious laughter and outrageous accusations. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this extremely rich player interaction that allows Good Cop Bad Cop to use a player elimination mechanic while keeping those who get knocked out involved in the conversation and invested in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s outcome.</notes>
