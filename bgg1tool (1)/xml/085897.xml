   <description>Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire!

The Doomgate is open, and Doom has been released into the world! The forces of destruction stalk the lands, destroying all they touch. There is but one dim flicker of hope: the Thunderstones, scattered at the dawn of time. Two lie hidden deep within the Dragonspire. 
Will your heroes be the first to reach them?
Dragonspire is a stand-alone expansion to Thunderstone. The cards within can be played with any or all of the past Thunderstone sets, or can be used by themselves as a fully playable set. Dragonspire adds a fresh crew of new heroes, along with new spells, villagers, and weapons all ready to help your stand against the darkness. They will be needed, for within new terrors have awakened: bloodthirsty undead, blistering elementals, wrathful dragons, and mighty giants! Dragonspire also includes brand-new dungeon settings, campaign rules, and an entirely new way to face Doom alone!</notes>

    <notes>Thunderstone Base Game is included in the box. The base game is missing the small divider cards. If you have Wrath of the Elements it included much better replacement dividers. Dragonspire is missing the randomizer cards for Wrath of the Elements and Doomgate Legion (again, not a huge deal).  Otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in perfect shape and never played.</notes>

    <notes>This is the ultimate upgrade to your Thunderstone Advance game: get all of these 1st edition cards that are still compatible with the Advance game.  Includes just about everything you need from the original Thunderstone, Thornwood Siege, Wrath of the Elements, Doomgate Legion, and Dragonspire.  I have priced this at about half of the price of buying each of these separately.  All cards are in very good condition, most in like-new condition.  A few cards and dividers are missing as noted below, and a few dividers have stickers over the label on one of their two (identical sides).
You get every type of monster, every type of hero, randomizers, VP tokens, storage tray, rulebooks, the board that came with Dragonspire, two sets of basic cards (militia, torch, dagger, iron rations, disease/special disease), Thunderstone cards, guardians, treasures and traps, dungeon features, etc.  I have verified the counts of all hero, village, and monster cards.
You get the following 30 monsters, and all 10 cards of each unless otherwise noted:
Abyssal
Abyssal - Malformed 
Abyssal - Thunderspawn
Bandit - Humanoid
Centaur
Cultist - Humanoid
Dark Enchanted
Doomknight - Humanoid
Dragon
Elemental - Fire
Elemental - Nature
Elemental - Pain
Enchanted (missing 1 out of 10)
Evil Druid - Humanoid
Giant
Golem
Horde
Humanoid
Hydra - Dragon
Ooze
Orc - Humanoid
Raider - Humanoid
Siege
Swarm
Undead - Doom
Undead - Lich
Undead - Plague
Undead - Spirit
Undead - Stormwraith
Verminfolk - Animal
You get the following 43 heroes with divider cards, everything is complete unless noted:
Amazon
Belzur
Blind
Cabal
Chalice
Chulian
Deep
Diin
Divine
Drunari
Dwarf
Elf
Evoker

This almost completely fits inside the Dragonspire box, but not quite (everything but the second set of base cards).  I also have the Doomgate Legion (smaller) box (missing its divider) that I can include with the rest of the cards, or I can just put them in a baggie (let me know).
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 200oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order, but expect it to be about $15-$20 total). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

This expansion is being sold with the cards and rules only as part of a complete collection of Thunderstone (first edition). The set includes all of the base set, Wrath of the Elements, Doomgate Legion, Dragonspire, Thornwood Siege, and Heart of Doom, along with all promos. Boards, tokens, and rules included. Cards are in great shape without much wear. Everything is packaged into the Dragonspire and Thornwood Siege boxes, which is why I am not selling the sets separately.
