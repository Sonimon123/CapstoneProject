   <description>There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Hustle and bustle in the bazaar district of Istanbul: merchants and their assistants are hurrying through the narrow alleys attempting to be more successful than their competitors. Good organization is key: wheelbarrows have to be filled with goods at the warehouses and then swiftly transported by the assistants to the various destinations. The goal of the merchants is to be the first to collect a certain amount of rubies. You are leading a merchant and four assistants through the 16 Places of the bazaar. At each Place, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge is that, to carry out an action at any of those Places, your merchant needs the help of an assistant and has to leave him behind. To use that assistant again later, your merchant has to come back to that Place and pick him up. So plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything... </notes>

Hustle and bustle in the bazaar district of Istanbul: merchants and their assistants are hurrying through the narrow alleys attempting to be more successful than their competitors. Good organization is key: wheelbarrows have to be filled with goods at the warehouses and then swiftly transported by the assistants to the various destinations. The goal of the merchants is to be the first to collect a certain amount of rubies. You are leading a merchant and four assistants through the 16 Places of the bazaar. At each Place, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge is that, to carry out an action at any of those Places, your merchant needs the help of an assistant and has to leave him behind. To use that assistant again later, your merchant has to come back to that Place and pick him up. So plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...</notes>

    <notes>The game has been played four times only by three very careful adults.
I will send this game to the eventual buyer using a courier delivery service.
 To most mainland UK destinations the p _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; p cost will be £5.00. Some more remote areas will cost a little more.
 At the time of writing this I also have other games for sale including the Mokka _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bakschisch expansion set for Istanbul. If you would like any of these as well I can combine p_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;p cost for a little extra cost.
 I am not prepared to send any games outside of the UK because of the huge postage costs involved.</notes>

    <notes>All pieces have been punched out or opened. Game has not been played and is in excellent condition. Will only ship to United States. Typically ships via USPS flat rate boxes (13.50), unless local enough for regional mailer box. If purchasing more than one game, a bigger box is often cheaper with UPS, which has ranged from 20-35 dollars depending on box size and distance.
