   <description>1889, an 18xx game in the series originated by Francis Tresham's 1829, is set in Shikoku Japan.  The rules are similar to 1830: Railways _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Robber Barons on a smaller and terrain-heavy map._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 1889, 2-6 players will use money to purchase shares in railroad companies during Share Dealing Rounds. Between subsequent Share Dealing Rounds, railroad corporations then conduct operations on the game board, with the decisions being made by the player who is the major share holder. The game simulates the progression of railroad development during an historic period on Shikoku. Old trains become obsolete while the revenue earnings from cities grows over time. Players will try to purchase the most profitable shares at the right times of the game to maximize earnings in dividends and stock value gains. In the end, the player with the highest value of personal cash and held stocks is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game was originally available in kit form from Wild Heaven, and is now also being published by Deep Thought Games, LLC._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is used, but is in generally good condition.  It is ready to play. It does not come with paper money.
I bought it from DTG as a manual cut game, but I had DTG laminate/cut the tiles.  I laminated the certificates (5mil gloss) and charters (3mil gloss).  The box may have some shelf wear.
Shipping cost for the first game is $12 and $5 more for each additional game. International shipping quote by request.</notes>

Condition Notes:
Unplayed. Uncut. Straight from DTG.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
