   <description>Diamant _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; also published as Incan Gold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>BRAND NEW in the shrink.
Diamant 2nd edition.  This now hard to find edition comes with the great components, the treasure chests and the wooden Indiana Jones meeples (both of these have been left out of the new Incan Gold version).
I usually ship the next day.   Parcel Post $7 or by Priority Mail $8 for US mailing. 
Contact me for mailing costs to all countries outside of the US.
Ask me about any of my other games for sale or trade. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m always glad to combining shipping for multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>Schmidt Spiele edition.
I have downloaded and included the English language rules. I have also downloaded and included the optional gameboard which was not included in the 2nd edition printings of Diamant. All components are language independent in the game.
Copy is punched and is in excellent condition.
Contact me for a shipping quote if you are interested in the game. NZ buyers can pay by direct deposit into my ANZ bank account. Australian buyers can pay by PayPal.
New Zealand Price:
$55 NZD
------------------------------------------------------------
For multiple game purchases I am happy to do a little better on the game prices. I try to charge as close to actual shipping costs as possible.
Thanks for looking at my games for sale.</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY 101171N)
Incan Gold (co-designed by Alan R. Moon, designer of Ticket to Ride) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you’ve acquired so far. 
Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found. 
After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and the winner! </notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101171N)
 Incan Gold (co-designed by Alan R. Moon, designer of Ticket to Ride) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found. After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and the winner!

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101171N)
Incan Gold (co-designed by Alan R. Moon, designer of Ticket to Ride) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found. After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and the winner!</notes>

    <notes>***NOT INCAN GOLD***
This is the RAREST and most sought after Edition of Diamant because it includes the game board with the camp in the box right from the factory!
This was a perk that was discontinued early on and customers still want it today!
This copy even has some extra rubies included so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never run out during the game!
Game has been opened to examine the contents and maybe been played a couple times at most. But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s primarily been collecting dust on my shelf for at least 5 years completely untouched. 
Everything inside and out is in beautiful condition. Very little shelfwear at all. All contents are MINT. 
You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be hardpressed to find a nicer copy that has been opened!
Stored w/care in a smoke free home.
International buyers are welcome!</notes>

    <notes>My late husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  All his games have been well taken care of,  most of them never even played.  All were stored in a non smoking household.  If the game was played, no food or drinks were allowed by the games.  Hopefully I will be able to find good homes for all his beloved games.  If you have any questions or concerns, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask</notes>

    <notes>Eagle-Gryphon Games (GRY101171N)
Incan Gold (co-designed by Alan R. Moon, designer of Ticket to Ride) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found. After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and the winner!</notes>

Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 5.90
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 7.35
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 7.35
Registered Post: (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 9.10
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 12.40
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 12.40
Registered post everywhere else. 
Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
3) As a last resort, I also accept Skrill, Payza and Neteller (In that order and buyer pays fees).
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>
