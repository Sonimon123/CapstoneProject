   <description>Shadows over Camelot is a cooperative/semi-cooperative hand-management and deduction-based board game for 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;7 players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests, ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail. Completed quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On each knight's turn, the knight takes a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;heroic action_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, such as moving to a new quest, building his hand, or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, he must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Moreover, one of the knights may be a traitor, pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering his fellow knights in subtle ways, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But enough words... don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse, and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a partial set of painted figures for Shadows over Camelot.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s assumed that you already own Shadows over Camelot and that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve bought the Company of Knights supplement that gives you painted figures for the game.  What I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering is the remaining figures in the game so that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have a complete set.
 
What you will get will be 4 picts, 4 saxons, 12 catapults, 1 holy grail, 1 excalibur, and 1 Lancelot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s armor.  All are painted and sealed, ready for play so that you can have a completely realized game all in color.  It really does make a difference visually.
 
I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to get the pics to work in the marketplace so you can go here to look at my work:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/echoota/sets/72157594354388174/
As payment I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $150US + Shipping + Your unpainted set of figures from your copy of Shadows over Camelot.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve painted my set and I need your set in return so I can continue to play my game :)
 
If you are interested then just complete the transaction and then you can either pay via paypal or send a check or money order with your unpainted figures to my address, and I will then send you this set of painted figures.  If you are from outside the US then I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to work out the shipping cost to send the figures to you.
 
I have done work for other BGGers, if you want to see my other work you can check them out on the SoC picts section, or the Fury of Dracula entry.
 
Thanks for looking!</notes>

I accept PayPal transfers. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t accept PayPal credit card payments. For international orders PayPal transfers (not credit cards) are strongly preferred but I will accept checks in USD drawn on a US bank. There may be additional shipping delays for international orders paid by check as I wait for the check to clear.
Buyer pays actual shipping charges for US addresses. International orders will incur a $2 handling fee. I will ship game within 1 business day of receiving payment, unless payment is by personal check. Personal checks will delay shipping by upto 7-10 business days after check arrives. I will combine shipping on multiple orders to lower overall shipping charges.

    <notes>Shadows Over Camelot lot
Everything you would need in one lot!
Includes:
Shadows Over Camelot - played twice - everything is in great shape except the plastic insert is cracked.  I think this is a common occurence, since the Holy Grail quest is slightly bigger than the insert.
Merlin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Company - Opened, but unplayed - in fact the cards are even still in the shrinkwrap
A Company of Knights - Opened, but unplayed
Bedivere, the Eighth Knight
All together, you get 2 versions of each knight, one painted and one unpainted, so you can play the harder squire variant.  You will even have an extra 3rd Bedivere!  (Paint him black to be the Black Knight!)
Let me know if you have any questions!</notes>

If your group is less blood-thisty this would be an excellent choice{also might be useful to entice a wife or girlfriend into trying out a boardgame!).

    <notes>Days of Wonder - Shadows over Camelot
Language: English
Players: 3 to 7 
Age: 10+
Duration: 60 to 80 min
Weight: 1.770 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In most games, players compete against each other to achieve victory. Shadows over Camelot proposes a journey of a very different kind, where you and your fellow players, as Knights of the Round Table, will collaborate to jointly defeat... the game! At first glance, this task seems simple enough. After all, shouldn’t a band of young and noble Knights - fleet of foot and sound of mind - easily defeat a game that plays itself? Alas your quest is further complicated by the ever-present possibility of a Traitor in your midst, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment... But enough words... Don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!

    <notes>This game has been played many times and it shows some wear.  Notably the box has shelf wear and a few dings (e.g. the corners) and the card show wear.  The game is 100% complete and fully playable, however.  None of the minis have been used (still unopened) because I used another set of painted minis when playing.
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Note: This game is only for Doyle Hunter (crusader_nc)
Edition: English edition
Condition: Acceptable. All parts present, but well worn. Cards are sleeved (clear Fantasy Flight iirc), but I recommend removing sleeves or trimming the card wells as the bottom sleeves are getting their corners bent.

    <notes>Box had some very, very minor shelf wear.  Virtually like-new.
Sir Bedivere the 8th knight available for $5.
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes!  When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive.  To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>This price is for the BASE GAME only.
If you also want to buy the expansion Merlin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Company, it costs an additional $15.
If you would like to add the rare, out of print, prepainted miniatures for the game, A Company of Knights, add an additional $15.
So for all three it would be $50 + $10 shipping = $60!
Items shipped once Paypal payment clears.</notes>

Publisher: Days of Wonder
I bought this copy soon after having played someone else_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy in the year it was released.  I removed the shrink, punched and bag the components... but like a lot of my games, has just sat on the shelf for 9 years.  Since this one never game off the shelf I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t spot any shelf wear.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s good as far as co-op games go, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve learned I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not a fan of co-op games...</notes>

Game is in very good condition, I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see any damage or wear worth noting but keep in mind this game was probably played a few times (but not by me :sadface: )
Buyer pays actual shipping costs.  Please contact me with your zip for a quote.</notes>

    <notes>SUPERB HAND PAINTED FIGURES.
Better than New! A very special offer with superb hand-painted figures and Sir Bedivere extra knight. Also includes Merlin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Company. Very good condition, only played a few times. All pieces and figures, knights, saxons, picts, catapults,  excalibur, holy grail and Lancelot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s armour are beautifully hand painted and match the game colour scheme. 
Merlin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Company is LIKE NEW - outer shrink wrap removed, but cards still shrink-wrapped. The figures Merlin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Company   are not painted, as this set is Like New.
Offers welcome.

* I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a longtime BGG member who must seriously cull my collection. 
* If you live in the US, this item fits nicely in a USPS Medium Flat Rate Priority Mail Box and ships for $13.65 
* If you live outside the US, I will ship worldwide, but all shipping related expenses will need to be paid by you, including tracking, if it is not already provided by that service. The price depends on your location and the service you choose. USPS is the default service I use, unless you select something different. This item weights approximately 5 pounds (boxed for delivery) and ships from Zip Code 20852 
* I usually ship twice a week--on Wednesdays and Saturdays. If needed faster, arrangements can be made by contacting me.</notes>
