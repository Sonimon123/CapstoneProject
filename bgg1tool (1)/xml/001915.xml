   <description>ICE's now-out-of-print CCG (they lost their license to produce Middle-Earth products in 1999). Players take the role of the Istari, or Wizards - most familiarly Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast, but also Pallando and Alatar - in the  struggle against Sauron in Middle-Earth. Each player competes to bring the greatest strength to bear against the Shadow, including Factions such as the Riders of Rohan or the Great Eagles, allies like Gwaihir or Shadowfax, items such as the lost Palantiri, Glamdring, or Narsil, and the completion of various quests - from the relatively straightforward rescue of prisoners through the involved Reforging of the Sword that was Broken, restoration of the White Tree to Minas Tirith, or the quest of quests, the destruction of the One Ring._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players build decks in which half are composed of resource cards and half of hazards, dedicated to the stopping of your opponent. This is where the big bad guys come in, with cards for the 9 Nazgul, a couple of Dragons (Smaug being the recognizable one), Shelob, and the Balrog._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The Challenge Decks, all 10 of them.
Only two of the decks have been played with, and they were only played once.  The rest are either opened and unplayed, or opened and the cards themselves are still shrinkwrapped.
Also included is the nice Middle Earth promo map which is getting a little difficult to find.  Take a look at it here:

Basically, this is everything to get you started!
I am happy with PayPal, so long as it does not come from a credit card.

    <notes>A large collection of MECCG cards, all from the Wizards.  There are several elements to this lot.
First, the cards.  There are a total of 2,254 with 1,451 from the limited edition and 803 from the unlimited edition.  There are 15 rares and 197 uncommons from the limited edition; 5 rares and 85 uncommons from the unlimited edition.  
The specific rares from the limited edition include:  Denethor II, Galadriel, Galva, Morgul Night, Storms of Ossk, Traitor, Dw. Ring of Durin‚Äôs Tribe, Easterlings, Palantir of Annuminas, The Mithril-coat, Carn Dum, The Stones, Variag Camp, and The Great Goblin (x2)
The specific rares from the unlimited edition include:  Lure of Power, The Precious, Lucky Search, and Tom Bombadil (x2)
There is at least one of every common between the limited and unlimited edition (and multiples in most cases), all but one of the fixed cards between both editions, and all but 9 of the uncommons between both editions.  Generally there are multiples of all commons, fixed, and uncommonns.
I have a complete account of all the cards by edition in an excel format by request.
This lot also include the handy box from the gift set (which is nice for storing, although can only hold half of these cards).  Also included are the three booklets from the gift set (card list booklet; Rulesbook, and Tip Book), the map of Middle-Earth, the promotional hobbit figures, and 2 burning eye dice.
Finally, there is the ICE book (#3333), Middle-Earth The Wizards Companion that includes rules, scenarios, card lists, etc.  A quite handy reference.

    <notes>3 boxes.  
2 boxes of 1998, Middle-Earth Challenge Deck/Ringwraith.  These two decks were in the back of the closet where they have been stored since received.  They have been opened and viewed but they were never used since my son knew no one who played.  The cards, instructions, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; box are pristine.  
I was given the 3rd box, called the Lidless Eye, limited edition, that lists 76 cards, but has 88 in the box _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; is missing the directions.  Although the box is not in good condition, the cards are in excellent condition.  But I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know what has been added, or what possibly is missing.</notes>

    <notes>Challenge Box, Mostly sealed.
8 of the 10 decks are completely sealed.
Saruman (A) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Alatar (B) decks have been partially opened to read rules. Half the cards in both decks are still sealed. One set of the rules is missing.
Case for the decks is falling apart.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got some weight to it. Around 2kg, so shipping will probably be around $25. I will charge $30, and refund the difference.
Paypal prefered.

Selling because I have no one to play and would rather have these cards used. I bought a box of Unlimited Starter decks, and 3 Hero Challenge Decks and 2 Minion Challenge Decks.

Feel free to ask for specific commons and such.
I will get a specific S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H price for you when we deal.
Thank you.

For a collector, I am not sure, but I would be happy to further describe the card if a collector has specific questions.

For a collector, I am not sure, but I would be happy to further describe the card if a collector has specific questions.
Card prices are listed next to each card.  Shipping costs $2 for 1-10 cards and $3 for 11-20 cards. I am always willing to negotiate or trade.

    <notes>I have about 150 cards plus a starter box (very worn). They appear to be a starter set, maybe a few additional boosters, and various promo cards. To be honest, I am not sure exactly what I have here in terms of value, so I hope this is a fair price. Maybe they are junk, or maybe you are getting a steal. I can send you a list of cards upon request, but can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell you what set they came from or things of that nature. I picked them up second hand so I am content to move them along.</notes>

From a smoke and pet-free home and will be carefully packed.

    <notes>Middle-Earth CCG Gift Set + Bonus
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling the Gift Set that was offered to me back in the mid-nineties.
It includes:
Gift Set Storage Box (original msrp: $43.50)
2 Starter Decks (Unlimited Edition)
4 The Wizards boosters (Unlimited Edition)
4 Dark Minions (Limited Edition)
2 The Dragons (Limited Edition)
2 Burning Eye Red Speckled Dice
2 Scoring Marker Figures (Hobbits)
1 Color A4/Letter Middle Earth Map with scoring marker
1 Large (A5 size) Rules book
1 Card List  (A5 size) 
1 Tip Book (A5 size) 
Bonus:
1 Starter Deck (Unlimited Edition)
1 Against the Shadow booster (Limited Edition)
This totals 390 cards, of which 285 are Unlimited and 105 are Limited. The Starters and boosters have been opened but have *never been played* and are therefore in Near Mint (I am always cautious with Mint ratings). Starter boxes and their rules leaflets are present. Also present are the booster wrappers for every booster I described above. The 3 Starters are from 3 different fixed sets. I include a full list of the singles here: 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8O1-tsUIxpATmp0VWVIWnpsZlE
The price of the rare singles alone, from what I was able to ascertain in gwaihir.net (found 20 rare pricings), totals somewhere near 80‚Ç¨. Boxes like these aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t available very often, and from what I was able to find in the internet, their sealed price is prohibitive. I tried to ask on the relevant forum what something like this might be worth but the post got deleted because the admins thought I was selling outside the Marketplace. The storage box is very sturdy and I would rate it in Very Good to Near Mint (top lid) and Very Good (bottom part). Every other printed book is in VG/NM state. The Card List has a checklist for your collection: I did some crosses with a pencil on the cards included back in the day, but you can easily use an eraser to clean. Both figures and dice are Mint.
Therefore, here is is. There and back again. Photos are also available upon request.
I accept Paypal and Bank Transfer (within the European Union). From my previous experience in shipping a board game through a parcel service the price within Europe is in the 15‚Ç¨ to 20‚Ç¨ range.</notes>

    <notes>This is a custom listing for an unopened booster box of Limited Edition Booster packs.  Please only purchase if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve previously communicated with me.  Booster box is in shrink but a little roughed up from years of sitting on a shelf with some other game materials stacked on top of it.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t believe the boosters are impacted, but I will remove the shrink to confirm this if the buyer would like.  
Also have an MECCG Gift set.  Game materials are like new.  Includes all the game materials plus one extra unlimited edition starter deck.  The card totals are 30 Dragon Expansion, 30 Dark Minions; and 232 Unlimited cards and some subset of the cards still in their original shiring (effectively there are 4 booster and 3 starter sets of unlimited edition cards).
Gift box itself has some modest edgewear/scuffing.</notes>

    <notes>This is a collection of four Challenge Decks (A, C, D, and E) with over 250 cards from The Wizards and The Dragons sets.
The boxes of the Challenge decks show significant wear (they were used to store other decks), but the cards are unplayed and in excellent condition (see pictures below):
The following Challenge Decks are included:
A - Stewards of Gondor (Saruman)
C - Dwarven Quest (Pallando)
D - Bargain Between Friends (Radagast)
E - Return of the King (Gandalf)
Unfortunately, there are a few cards missing from each deck: Deck A is missing 11 cards (Sapling of the White Tree, The White Tree, Ioreth, Cram, Marvels Told x3, Wizard Uncloaked, Smoke Rings, Rebuilding the Town, and Glittering Caves), Deck C is missing 4 cards (Cram, Wormsbane, Smoke Rings, Isle of the Ulond, and Incite Denizens), Deck D is missing 4 cards (Noble Hound x2, Forewarned is Forearmed, and Noble Steed), and Deck E is missing 4 cards (Return of the King, Smoke Rings, Noble Steed x2). Some of these missing cards are also in the extra cards I am including. Each deck comes with a rule book: all but one of these look unread; 1 rulebook is used.
The extra 250+ cards are all from The Wizards (mostly blue border, with some black border cards) and The Dragons. There are many duplicates and many common and fixed cards, but also a good amount of uncommon and a few rare cards (a few are pictured below; there are some more in the lot). Many of these cards are in very good condition and have never been played, but some have been played and show some very slight wear as is to be expected. I will include a rule book for The Wizards and the rule insert of The Dragons.
Shipping to the UK (signed) is ¬£5.00; shipping to the EU (signed) is ¬£16.60. Payment is by PayPal.

    <notes>This listing is for over 360 cards, including all the cards you will need to play the popular Arda variation of MECCG with two players, organized into the following decks:
* Play Deck (107 cards): A roughly even mix of resources and hazards. No repeats for maximum variety.
* MP Deck (41 cards): Cards that produce Marshaling Points (MPs)
* Site Deck (41 cards): Note that I have combined this with the MP Deck to create a single _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Quest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deck per variant rules posted here on BGG, but you can easily undo this to play by the original Arda rules.
* Character Deck (21 cards), including 2 Wizards (Alatar and Radagast)
* Offering Deck (21 cards): Minor Items
Of course, you can tear these decks down for deckbuilding of your own, especially since I am including another 131 cards beyond those listed above. This extra set of cards includes 97 different cards and no more than two copies of any given card.
NOTES
Set Composition: These cards are mostly limited (black-bordered), but about 1 in 5 are unlimited (blue-bordered) versions in the mix. The decks draw from the original Wizards set and the Dragons expansion. Almost all of these cards are commons and uncommons, but there are a couple rares included.
Condition: Some of these cards have never been played and look brand new. Others have been played a few times and are showing some minor whitening along the edges. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed the condition of the set as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; overall, even though on average it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s probably better than that.
Region cards are not included, but I can toss a bunch of them in, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested.</notes>
