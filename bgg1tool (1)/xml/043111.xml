    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG GW01)
What hope can there be for the mortal world?
— Liber Malefic
In the Warhammer world, four Gods of Chaos battle for supremacy. Khorne, the Blood God, the Skulltaker, lusts for death and battle. Nurgle, the Plaguelord, the Father of Corruption, luxuriates in filth and disease.Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, the Great Conspirator, plots the fate of the universe. Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure and Pain, the Lord of Temptations, lures even the most steadfast to his six deadly seductions.
In the Chaos in the Old World board game, each player takes the role of one of the malevolent Lords of Chaos. Each god’s distinctive powers and legion of followers give the controlling player unique strengths and heretical abilities with which to corrupt and enslave the Old World. Yet, as the powers of Chaos seek domination by corruption and conquest, they must vie not only against each other, but also against the desperate denizens of the Old World who fight to banish the gods back to the maelstrom of the Realm of Chaos... for now.
The time of woe is upon us.
— Grimoire Daemonicus
Chaos in the Old World includes:

What hope can there be for the mortal world?
— Liber Malefic
In the Warhammer world, four Gods of Chaos battle for supremacy. Khorne, the Blood God, the Skulltaker, lusts for death and battle. Nurgle, the Plaguelord, the Father of Corruption, luxuriates in filth and disease.Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, the Great Conspirator, plots the fate of the universe. Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure and Pain, the Lord of Temptations, lures even the most steadfast to his six deadly seductions.
In the Chaos in the Old World board game, each player takes the role of one of the malevolent Lords of Chaos. Each god’s distinctive powers and legion of followers give the controlling player unique strengths and heretical abilities with which to corrupt and enslave the Old World. Yet, as the powers of Chaos seek domination by corruption and conquest, they must vie not only against each other, but also against the desperate denizens of the Old World who fight to banish the gods back to the maelstrom of the Realm of Chaos... for now.
The time of woe is upon us.

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition and has only been played twice.  I listed it as very good condition because the box is black so there is minor shelf wear.  None of the pieces are broken.  
I accept paypal payments and ship upon payment.
This game will ship in a USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate box so shipping is $10.00</notes>

Note: Some figures (zealots) carry banners that have a slight bend in them. The figures are made of a plyable plastic and ship already removed from their die. Looking through BGG photos of the components, it appears this is a common condition. It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hinder their use, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m supplying full disclosure so OCD buyers will not be blindsided :)
I will ship via USPS flat rate w/ newspaper cushioning; I will supply a shipping cost estimate at time of purchase, but you can figure it too using the USPS website (if it fits, it ships.)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling other games as well, all similarly discounted. If you buy multiple games, we can work out the best/most efficient shipping on the bundle.
I can provide pictures as requested, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m more than happy to field any questions you might have via GeekMail.</notes>

    <notes>Chaos in the Old World + Horned Rat Expansion
Bought but unfortunately never got a chance to play.
All cards where sleeved when purchased (and will remain so)
the miniatures are in individual little containers (which will be provided)
Majority of the tokens and small cards are in ‘pill box’ (which will be provided) the others are in bags and stored within the HRE box
The original box insert was taken out to accommodate the expansion and plastic containers etc.
The lid shuts perfectly well.
As stated this hasn’t been played so all components are new, although they have been punched out from the card broad frames, put into sleeves etc.) The box is in excellent condition with no bumps and tears however I will thoroughly package when posting to try and keep it as such but I can be held accountable for damage caused during postage.
ALSO Please note the price listed is not the price I’m looking for, Its there as an expensive starting point from which I will come down from. I feel that given the customised nature of the storage, sleeved cards, pill boxes, expansions etc this is a high end price. Therefore please make sensible offers under this and hopefully we can arrange something out.</notes>

Base game is in like-new condition, save for 3 cultists (one red, one blue, one purple) who arrived with their tiny wheels off/missing.  It was such a minor thing I never bothered to contact games workshop.  Otherwise, game has been played a handful of times and is in excellent condition.

The Box insert was a crappy FFG one so I tossed it for much better organization.  The game has only been played once. If you have any questions Geekmail me.

    <notes>Includes the Horned Rat expansion set in this sale as well.  I have opened the expansion and sleeved it is all.  The original game has been played 5 or 6 times.  All components are present.  I did not affix the dials to the game board, but have the hardware they supplied to do that.  I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to do that as it made it easier to store back in the game box.  The cards are sleeved and not included in the sale unless the buyer would like to add $8 to cover the cost of the sleeves.  They are the Fantasy Flight Games sleeves.  Let me know at time of purchase so I have time to either pull the cards or know that you will be paying more for the sleeves.  This includes the expansion being sleeved as well.  Insurance will be optional for the buyer.  Shipping to be provided by USPS.  Actual shipping charges to be billed to the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGGW01)
What hope can there be for the mortal world? - Liber Malefic In the Warhammer world, four Gods of Chaos battle for supremacy. Khorne, the Blood God, the Skulltaker, lusts for death and battle. Nurgle, the Plaguelord, the Father of Corruption, luxuriates in filth and disease. Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, the Great Conspirator, plots the fate of the universe. Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure and Pain, the Lord of Temptations, lures even the most steadfast to his six deadly seductions. In the Chaos in the Old World board game, each player takes the role of one of the malevolent Lords of Chaos. Each god_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s distinctive powers and legion of followers give the controlling player unique strengths and heretical abilities with which to corrupt and enslave the Old World. Yet, as the powers of Chaos seek domination by corruption and conquest, they must vie not only against each other, but also against the desperate denizens of the Old World who fight to banish the gods back to the maelstrom of the Realm of Chaos...for now. The time of woe is upon us. - Grimoire Daemonicus </notes>

    <notes>Hi there,
This concerns both the base game and the Horned Rat expansion, both in the base game box!
The game is in very good condition. A couple of cultist staffs are broken off, like in probably all copies. And there is slight shelf wear on the box. Otherwise, all is fine and all components are nice and tidy in a plano box.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, send me a note and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look up the shipping costs for you.
Kind regards, Joost</notes>

My eBay profile has this sane username if you want an idea of my feedback history. BGG is a way better idea for this sale, though.</notes>

    <notes>New, in shrink. You have an option to add on a new copy of Polish version of  The Horned Rat expansion for 10€. While it would need paste-ups on cards, with good scans and sleeves it shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be too distracting, and all other components, including miniatures, are tye same.

    <notes>Played the game once, really liked it, but my casual group just got wrecked by Khorne and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t feel like trying again.  Everything is in bags and in original condition, although I think one cultist came with their staff missing a small piece at the top (just a warning for those wanting perfection, seems to be an FFG thing as my Fury of Dracula was the same).  Also a couple corners have turned slightly white.
Buyer pays for shipping 10-20$ anywhere in Canada.

    <notes>2009 Fantasy Flight edition. This is not the copy for someone seeking perfection, the price comes with some issues which i have photos to clarify. The box is worn, the rule book has a minor tear on the front cover _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; one section of the player board/map is not connected to the rest of the board (which should be easily repairable with some glue) the third photo shows the section of the board that needs gluing.  Please see my photos for details of each of these issues.  The components are all accounted for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; other than the problems aforementioned the rest of the game is in good condition considering its age.</notes>

    <notes>I enjoy this game but I think there are people out there who will treasure it more than i do so have decided to sell it. I’ve been through the components carefully _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; there’s a tzeench corruption marker missing. This shouldn’t effect gameplay. Otherwise it’s pretty much as good as new and has only been played a couple of times. 
Let me know if you have any preferences with shipping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; I’ll do my best to accommodate them.
