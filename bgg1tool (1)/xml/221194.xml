   <description>In Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species, and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most visitors each season that the park opens._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential visitors, but you'd better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your visitors, and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores, but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to attract visitors to your park the good old-fashioned way?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Everything is in great condition.
Re: shipping costs, be warned that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a very dense and heavy box! Based on my experience, shipping to the US East Cost will probably be around $12, and the West Coast might be as high as $20 or so.</notes>

    <notes>Dinosaur Island board game
Dinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jon Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Wasteland Express Delivery Service) and Brian Lewis (Titans of Industry) from Pandasaurus Games (Machi Koro, Yedo, Wasteland Express Delivery Service) with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.
2-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+
In Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens.
Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They’ll definitely excite potential guests… but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests—and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores… but then you aren’t going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?
When we first played Dinosaur Island we knew we had something extremely special on our hands. We had an accessible worker placement game that mixed some of our favorite gameplay elements rolled up in a theme that is ridiculously fun and perfectly integrated with mechanics. I love games that have simple mechanics that lead to incredibly tense decisions. Like a dice pool as a resource (DNA), set-collection, turn-efficiency, a clever auction mechanic, and extremely tense decisions about where to spend your time and energy? Yes, please! You can also focus on upgrading your laboratory to make dinosaur creation more efficient. But if you do, it means you’re spending less time on opening new rides. And the constant pressure to keep your guests safe while still turning a profit every season creates interesting decision making on players. It’s a nail biter, for sure.

    <notes>Played once as a 2 player then bagged and stored into the box. Please note that Boardgamegeek provides a Deluxe Edition components list under the Dinosaur Island FAQ heading and that there are 9 insult and 2 blank insult tiles in the Deluxe Edition rather than the amount stated. These are not used in the game but included for fun. In common with most Deluxe Editions (due to the crazy amount of components!) the corner of the lower box lid has a partial corner split that was evident on receipt of the game. Pandasaurus have stated that they will replace affected boxes when they complete another production run but of course there is no guarantee for this or date. 
Shipping in the UK will be £8 for collect plus economy and that includes insurance for up to £100. Collection is free. Shipping outside the UK is likely to be expected=nsive as this is a very heavy game! PayPal gift or bank transfer please due to the cost of this game.</notes>

Asking that buyer pay shipping. Alternatively, can arrange pickup in Connecticut/Massachusetts or on Friday or Saturday of PAX Unplugged 2018. 
This is a solid game with a fantastic theme. However, I am cutting down my collection and, given the player count + complexity level, it sadly will not hit the table enough times to justify a spot on the shelf.</notes>

    <notes>This is for Dino Island X-treme edition base game AND the Totally Liquid expansion together! This is from my pledge in the 2018 Kickstarter. Totally Liquid just came in the mail and it is unopened.
The base game has been played a couple of times, but it is otherwise like new. It includes everything from the Kickstarter, minus the novelty cardboard pogs (no in-game purpose) that I could never fit into the box along with everything else.
Shipping is from zip code 60914 (or local pickup). Shipping on these two might get pricey, but I will try to get you the best deal possible. Also, I will NOT charge more than $30 shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll eat the cost if shipping gets more than that, but I honestly think (hope) it should be less.</notes>

    <notes>Expansion is not included here.
Punched but never played.
All needed game contents are in the main box (with original insert, GASP I know).
Only items not in box but in a bag externally are the cardboard bits replaced by deluxe content like scientists and coins.  Also the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pogs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are not in the main box, sorry in quotes cause they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re too small to be real pogs, and they didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even include a slammer so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re pretty counters I guess.
Shipped in Medium Flat Rate box. US Only.</notes>

Kickstarter X-treme edition
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;This edition will include almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0 Kickstarter: the Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples, and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons. Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition. And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;</notes>
