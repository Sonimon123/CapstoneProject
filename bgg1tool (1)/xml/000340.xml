   <description>This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The game is complete and in very good condition. It was only played a few times.
I prefer to ship via UPS for tracking reasons, so shipping will vary depending on the destination. The package will be well packed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting this for sale a little low because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to reduce my collection in prepration for my move. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting more games soon, so keep a eye out for those as well.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO138)
The cards in this game feature some very cute animals by Doris Matthaeus. It is a trick-taking game played with changing partners over several hands. In each hand, the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards, but there are special cards that can add or subtract from a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s score. Thus, players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards and what cards they take in tricks!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO138)
The cards in this game feature some very cute animals by Doris Matthaeus. It is a trick-taking game played with changing partners over several hands. In each hand, the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards, but there are special cards that can add or subtract from a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s score. Thus, players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards and what cards they take in tricks!</notes>

    <notes>Condition is probably more like Excellent - essentially no wear, even on the box.  German version, obviously, but includes English rules, plus a set of graphical player aids.  Shipping is £3 within the UK, at cost elsewhere.  (Probably free if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying something else!)</notes>

    <notes>Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. My copy comes with the English rules.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.
On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>
