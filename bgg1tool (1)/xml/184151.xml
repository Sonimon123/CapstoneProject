Here, the clans serve the Emperor and engage in courtly deceptions and power plays, even as they wage war against each other and the evil forces that plague their realm. This is the world of Legend of the Five Rings!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game set in the world of Rokugan, the original setting for the Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game. To play a Living Card Game, players create individual decks of cards from a base game with a fixed set of cards; they can then add supplemental card packs to this game world, with each pack also having a fixed set of cards, in order to vary their game experience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;While the connection of Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game to Rokugan and the Colonies _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; as well as its pervasive themes of honor, nobility, magic, intrigue, duty, and warfare _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; should carry over from the original L5R CCG, Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game is not compatible with that original game and will feature significant changes in the game mechanisms._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>3x Core set. Opened, almost unused. Played a couple games, but it just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me.  I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keep the boxes, but I will ship with the sleeves I used (3 decks fully sleeved). One set of tokens are unpunched, the other 2 still in shrink.  Will likely transfer into long boxes, shipping with binders can be dangerous. If you want, I can include the binder, I will just take the cards out so they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t risk getting wrecked.  Shipping is free in Canada, add $5 for USA. (I basically included shipping in the price, it just costs about $5 more to ship to the states. Please note currency is in USD, despite me living in Canada.</notes>

    <notes>3 Core Sets plus 
4 Dynasty packs:
    Tears of Amaterasu
    For Honor and Glory
    Into the Forbidden City
    Fate Has No Secrets (New - unopened)
Planning to ship in a large flat rate box priority 2 day mail = $18.85
2 Core boxes will fit into the large flat rate box (along with the Dynasty Packs), so will place the contents of the third Core box into one of the other (to facilitate shipping)
All contents complete and in extremely good condition - let me know if any questions.
Basically all the items are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, although I played the game a dozen times but there is no way to tell other than the counters are punched in two of the core boxes.</notes>
