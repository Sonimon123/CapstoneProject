It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SCALE:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    TIME 6 months per turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    MAP Point-to-point system_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    UNIT Battalions, Regiments, and war parties_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:       Two_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COMPONENTS:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    271 full-color, die-cut counters, including stand-up leader counters and circular Irregulars    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    One 22x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheet Note that 2010 Reprint version includes a MOUNTED mapboard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    70 Strategy Cards:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    16-page Rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    24-page Playbook (including a 6-page Example of Play)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    2 Player Aid sheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Volko Ruhnke_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DEVELOPER: Rob Winslow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Rodger B.

Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A lot of the interesting aspects of this war are covered through rules or special cards, from the early recalcitrance of the colonial assemblies and infighting amongst the colonials to the very different natures of the battles of outposts and sieges and the raiding in the backwoods._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ? and Andean Abyss and other GMT COIN Series games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Wilderness War: the French and Indian War 1755-1760 –Volko Ruhnke-GMT
Condition: Punched -the game is complete and almost like new condition. All the parts are bagged or in the counter tray that I added. The map and cards are crisp and clean. The only blemish is a ¼ bump at the top of the game box. The shipping cost will be determined by the speed of delivery you desire.

    <notes>This game has been punched, the pieces including cards are ziplocked, but the game has never been played (never could get the time or courage!)
Water leaked onto the box, but you really can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell. I add this just so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s known that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not 100% mint, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed it as Very Good, but honestly this is really a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; game.
The box top bows out more than my other games. This is something that happened without any intervention.</notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT010410)
Wilderness War takes two players into the French _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control. Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance. </notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT010410)
Wilderness War takes two players into the French _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control. Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance. </notes>

    <notes>The Wilderness War from GMT Games, 2nd printing 2010 - new in shrink-wrap.
$39.95 + Shipping
E-mail for shipping cost. 
(from GMT website:)
Wilderness War takes two players into the French _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.
Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.

    <notes>Recently punched and played once. Everything is in like new condition and I added in some color player aids that are in the BGG files section for the game.
Game will ship from Valley Village CA via USPS flat rate shipping ($13.45). If its cheaper to send standard USPS because you are on the west coast, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know. I would also be willing to arrange for local pickup. Look at my other items to combine shipping in a large flat rate box for $18.75.
I can accept chase quick pay or paypal.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Cheers,
Chris</notes>

    <notes>1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. If you want the game to be shipped outside of the USA, please geekmail me first. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.</notes>
