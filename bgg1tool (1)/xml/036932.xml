   <description>Claustrophobia is a miniatures-based survival game set within the universe of Hell Dorado._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The box contains pre-painted miniatures which are placed on large tiles showing the dungeon spaces.  Also included are character boards, counters and markers, and dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One player controls a small group of determined humans, while the other plays an almost unending army of demonic creatures.  The game is thematic and highly asymmetric: human characters are stronger, but the demon characters are more numerous.  Gameplay is very straightforward with a minimum of rules, and each game plays in an hour or less._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Basically, dice are allocated after rolling to perform actions, while cards or special abilities are also available.  The game is about managing decisions and choosing what to do with the resources that you have, managing difficult events and out-thinking your opponent.  Combat is handled by dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity is low, with the focus on theme and building towards a tense, climactic ending. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Claustrophobia is played through scenarios of which there are several in the rulebook.  Generally speaking, the human characters are attempting to complete a task (e.g. escape the catacombs, close a portal) while the demons are focused on stopping them.  There are varying win conditions depending on the scenario chosen._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Hell gates are open - there’s no escape! 
 
1634. Humanity wants more, Hell is the next target.
 
In this tactical survival game, one player controls the human group that explores the infernal underground and confronts a steady-stream troglodyte’s army, and your opponent plays the demon group who tries to stop them.
 
In this game you will find high quality materials with pre-painted figurines, combined with easy to learn rules that allow you to set the game up quickly. This game takes some of the best features of Euro board games mechanisms, (character skill management) as well as American (random combat resolution). Be ready to make Claustrophobia you’re next favorite head-to-head board game.
 
The six scenarios included in the game will provide you hours of gaming in the dark and gloomy New-Jerusalem Underground. When the scenarios no longer have any more secrets for you, you will be able to create your own or go on the Claustrophobia website where you will find unseen scenarios and a FAQ. If that is not enough, Croc himself (the author) will provide you some advice to help you on your Hell’s adventures.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee - Claustrophobia
Language: English 
Players: 2
Age: 14+
Duration: about 45 min
Weight: 2.600 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: This game is for two players, one plays the demons and the other the human Westerners. The two camps are found in the middle of labyrinthine sewers. The board is built during the course of the game. Claustrophobia is scenario based, resulting in a high replay value, especially as each camp is played differently… For the Westerners it is a question of surviving the increasingly violent attacks of the demons. While the light sources are reduced progressively, the demonic troglodytes become increasingly stronger and return in ever increasing numbers!
Of course the human player has to organize their figurines to keep them protected, while using their equipment as well as possible in order to win the scenario! The game will contain pre-painted miniatures.
See Details (more info) or below for complete selling, payment and shipping conditions.</notes>

Hell gates are open - there’s no escape! 
1634. Humanity wants more, Hell is the next target.
In this tactical survival game, one player controls the human group that explores the infernal underground and confronts a steady-stream troglodyte’s army, and your opponent plays the demon group who tries to stop them.
In this game you will find high quality materials with pre-painted figurines, combined with easy to learn rules that allow you to set the game up quickly. This game takes some of the best features of Euro board games mechanisms, (character skill management) as well as American (random combat resolution). Be ready to make Claustrophobia you’re next favorite head-to-head board game.
The six scenarios included in the game will provide you hours of gaming in the dark and gloomy New-Jerusalem Underground. When the scenarios no longer have any more secrets for you, you will be able to create your own or go on the Claustrophobia website where you will find unseen scenarios and a FAQ. If that is not enough, Croc himself (the author) will provide you some advice to help you on your Hell’s adventures.</notes>

    <notes>Hi there!
Up for sale is Claustrophobia. I have limited closet space and need to sell some games. These are games that are in near-new condition, played only once, and just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t click with my gaming group. They come from a smoke-free, adult home with no kids and no pets. I take absolute meticulous care of all my board games. I do not allow friends to eat and drink while playing these games. Hopefully they can find a home in your inventory where they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be played and loved :)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGG, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much feedback, but you can check my eBay account (x.metal), which has over 820 feedback with no negatives. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping for multiple items.
Send me a geekmail if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMCLAU01)
When humanity wants more, Hell is the next target. The year is 1634. Always hungry for more than they have, humanity targets Hell. Brave warriors and desperate convicts descend into the caverns below New Jerusalem, carving out a domain in tunnels full of demonic minions. Battle your way through a never-ending stream of feral troglodytes, or play the demon horde and summon your most powerful demons to put a stop to humanity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trespassing once and for all. Claustrophobia is the head-to-head game of exploration and combat in the very bowels of Hell. Combining the best of European and American game mechanics, and featuring high-quality components and pre-painted figures, the game will have you running and fighting and maneuvering in the dank passages underneath the city of New Jerusalem. Easy-to-learn rules and innovative game mechanics keep the game moving as fast as you can run. </notes>

    <notes>Description:
In this tactical survival game, one player controls the human group that explores the infernal underground and confronts a steady-stream troglodyte’s army, and your opponent plays the demon group who tries to stop them.
 In Claustrophobia, you find high quality materials with pre-painted figurines, combined with easy-to-learn rules that allow you to set the game up quickly. This game takes some of the best features of Euro board game mechanisms, (character skill management) as well as American (random combat resolution). Be ready to make Claustrophobia your next favorite head-to-head board game.
 
The six scenarios included in the game will provide you hours of gaming in the dark and gloomy New-Jerusalem Underground. When the scenarios no longer have any more secrets for you, you will be able to create your own or go on the Claustrophobia website where you will find new scenarios and a FAQ. If that is not enough, Croc himself (the author) will provide you some advice to help you on your Hell’s adventures. Follow the link to get the latest news on Claustrophobia.
 
Features:
17 finely sculpted pre-painted figurines
A modular board (36 tiles), each game will be different
Easy to learn and quick set-up game

    <notes>This auction is for a very well cared for, played twice Claustrophobia.  
The game is complete and the cards that are included are sleeved.   I also have the De Profundus expansion for auction, so if interested look for it. 
I love this game, but never get it to the table, so I am selling it to make room and so you can have a chance to get the game at a good price.
This comes from a smoke free home, all shipping charges you will pay for.
Thanks for looking, any questions get a hold of me.</notes>

    <notes>This listing includes both expansions, De Profundis and Furor Sanguinis, for an extra 30 CAD each (so a total of 100 CAD). Note that the whole lot is sold for over 165 CAD online when new. The GeekMarket doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t let me list this as a lot so I had to proceed this way (listing 100$ for the base game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really attractive!).
The game is in excellent condition and has only been played a few times. The Furor Sanguinis expansion is unpunched but has never been played.
Contact me to know how much shipping it costs, I usually answer quickly! I can ship worldwide.
Thank you for your interest!

    <notes>The box has some (non-critical) edge and corner damage, but the components therein are in great shape. Factory-painted miniatures, large dungeon tiles... this game has some great components.
Shipping will be $18.85 priority mail flat rate to anywhere in the USA. Sorry it’s so much, but it’s a big game and that’s the cheapest I can do. I’ve reduced the price of the game to still allow this to be a great deal.</notes>

    <notes>Claustrophobia board game plus the De Profundis expansion.  There is light box wear but I only played a few times so the parts are in very good condition.  I cut out the bottom of one section of the base game box insert so that the original game box can fit all of the base + expansion content.  I still have the empty box for De Profundis if you are interested but it will increase the shipping cost.</notes>
