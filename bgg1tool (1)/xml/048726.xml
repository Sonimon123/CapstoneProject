   <description>Do you have what it takes to be a deep space colonist?  An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring!  This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Played twice.  The only indicator that this game has been played is because the board has an odd finish, which shows every little place a die or cube has been slid across it if you look at it at the right angle for the light to hit it.  First edition Pandemic had this same finish to the board that did the same thing.  Other than the very minor marking to the board due to the poor choice of finish, the game is pristine!
This copy contains the preorder bonuses, which are the plastic ship score markers and two promo Alien Tech cards.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know shipping costs once I have your address, but I would guess this will cost $10-$12 to ship to the US, and obviously significantly more elsewhere in the world.</notes>

    <notes>Played 3 times, excellent condition.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  All cards were immediately sleeved upon opening the game.
An excellent game that any fan of euro_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s or sci-fi would enjoy.  I hate to give this one up, but time_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are tough, and I would like to find it a good home!</notes>

    <notes>Played once, with care (no rolling dice on board, etc), so have retained pretty much mint condition. 
Shipping is what I believe actual shipping charges will be to the US (I expect to lose money slightly, if anything).  Check out my other sales -I have some rare and cool games for sale at reasonable prices, and combining shipping will go a long way to defray costs. Buy enough stuff, and I will certainly discount it! Although I have just started selling games, I have been around a long time, and have a decent trade rating.</notes>

    <notes>This is a brand-new, factory sealed copy of the hit board game Alien Frontiers!
Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.
The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system’s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.
As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.
The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.
Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?

    <notes>ALIEN FRONTIERS + FACTIONS EXPANSION
I am seeling my copy of Alien Frontiers plus the Factions Expansion. Both are in excellant condition (with Factions having been literally played with once.)
As you maybe aware the Factions box is stored within the Base Game box.
Everything is accounted for (with a few extra plastic rockets for good measure!) and honestly is great condition.
I am selling simply because I am prepring for new games expected for my birthday and this one simply didnt make the cut,we prefer anthor similar game and often play that apposed to this one.

    <notes>This is the 2011 third edition with rockets and mind control helmet tech cards. Board shows slight warping, but otherwise like new.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 95051 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure my copy of this game has never been played (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played the game quite a few times but not my copy).  The cards look like they have never even been touched.  This is the complete package: base game, two copies of Mind Control helmet promo card, Factions expansion, Faction Pack #1 (still in shrink), and the Upgrade Pack (contains upgraded plastic cities).  Box for the base game only.

    <notes>Played a few times, but still in very good condition.  All of this stuff is in the main box.  If they came in separate boxes, they are long gone.  I just kept everything together.
I think this is the English First Editon, second or third printing.  Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember.  I remember it was the first printing where the color changed, so I got a promo space crane extra because the original space cranes had the wrong color backs.
Comes with:
Base Game
Space Crane updated with new card back
Mind Control Helmet
Upgrade Pack
Alien Frontiers Factions
Alien Frontiers Faction Pack #1
Some extra weird clear relic ship die that we never used.
Make an offer.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to thin my collection.</notes>

    <notes>There are many versions of this game and it has many expansions, so I want to be very clear on what this lot includes:
--The first edition of the game. The board has  couple minor dings, which is why I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed the condition as only _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; I have included a picture of the ding as the image for this listing.
--Two Mind Control Helmet cards. These were not included in the first edition but were sent to owners of the first edition later. Unfortunately, these two cards have a lighter back than the rest of the deck, so you can see when they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re coming. If this bugs you, a partial solution is to deal from the bottom.
--The [thing=93193]Alien Frontiers: Factions[/thing] expansion. In addition to the factions, this expansion provides purple ship dice and colony tokens for a fifth player.
--The [thing=107407]Alien Frontiers: Faction Pack #1[/thing] expansion (which provides the faction _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Xeno Explorations, Inc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).
--The [thing=138348]Alien Frontiers Upgrade Pack[/thing]. This pack provides plastic dome pieces to replace the wooden colony tokens for the base game, for all 5 player colors. It also provides plastic pieces to replace the three field tokens. 
All of this fits in the main game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box. I keep the box for the Factions expansion inside the main game box. I discarded the flimsy boxes for Faction pack #1 and the Upgrade Pack. 
I also have the [thing=70647]Outer Belt expansion[/thing], in shrink, listed in the Marketplace. If you buy that with this item, I will knock $5 off the total cost.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game has been played just once.  All components are still in excellent condition.
All game playing components are present (counters, dice, discs, cubes, colony tokens, game board, cards and game rules).  The cards were in card sleeves during the one play.
The game box is also in very good condition even after two years.  The insert is still in the box and in fine shape. As this box has been carried around for a few years, you can see where the box has rubbed up against other boxes or sides (the box is essentially black!).  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bit visible if you go looking for it.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He took excellent care of all his games, they all come from a smoke free environment.  No food or drink was allowed near the games.  He passed away in 2012 and it is time to find new homes for all his board games.   Thank you</notes>

    <notes>You are bidding on Alien Frontiers with ALL expansions for the game.  Only played twice and most of the expansions have never been played with just not are type of game for my game group everything is in perfect condition.

Shipping will be an extra $20 due to the weight of the box very heavy with all the expansions.
