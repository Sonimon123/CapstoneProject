   <description>Blue Moon is a card game for two players, which has often been compared to Magic: The Gathering, although it has considerably different game mechanics. Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Rules overview from the official rules:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s power, and so on. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Description from the publisher._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

BUNDLE!
This includes the base Blue Moon game, plus ALL 9 expansions:
Buka Invasion
The Mimix
The Aqua
The Flit
The Pillar
The Khind
The Terrah
E_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;I Blessings
E_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;I Allies
Base game and Allies have been opened and played a couple times, but contents are complete and still in excellent condition.  All other expansions are still in shrink-wrap.  I bought them because I like the base game, but never had time to get into it further.
These all fit into a USPS medium flat-rate box, which is $9.85 shipped anywhere within the USA.
If you want to break up this set and only buy a few decks, send me a geekmail and we can work something out.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - Blue Moon Base game
Language: English
Players: 2
Age: 12+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.570 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The god Blue Moon has deserted the world and plunged it into chaos. Blue Moon City is in ruins and its people have fallen into open war. Multiple factions seek to appease Blue Moon and hasten his return by currying the favor of the three dragons of elemental power. In the ruins of the great city, the ingenious Hoax seek to dominate through their mechanical inventions, while deep below ground, the fiery Vulca wield the molten force of the heart of the world. On the craggy mountaintops, the birdlike Flit watch the struggle unblinkingly, waiting for the right moment to make their move. And in the secret heart of the forest, the beautiful but wild Mimix sharpen their spears.
Blue Moon is fast-paced and easy to learn. Each player plays with a 30-card deck, representing one of the factions vying for control of the three elemental dragons. Each card is oversized, allowing more space to show off the artistic detail. Each turn, the players battle for control of the dragons, playing characters or other helpful cards from their deck, and imbuing their characters with greater and greater power, in order to overwhelm their opponent and force a retreat. In the advanced game, players have the option of building their own deck, constructing a powerful multi-faction alliance. The basic set provides all the materials needed to play Blue Moon, including the races of the fiery VULCA and the clever HOAX, as well as a gorgeous game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures.

    <notes>*FRENCH-LANGUAGE EDITION.* Played 2-3 times. No English manual in the box, and *very challenging* for non-Francophones due to the rather esoteric text on the cards and the mechanics of the game. I strongly recommend non-French speakers give this one a pass. *BONUS MIMIX DECK (ENGLISH!!) BEING THROWN IN FOR FREE.* Why do I have an English Mimix deck and a French Blue Moon game? Because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m both bilingual and wacky. I can arrange a meet with Montrealers to save them shipping costs (but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only in town once or twice a month on weekends); other buyers, tell me how you want it delivered via Canada Post from postal code J1H 2W5 and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll honor your request after I confirm the shipping rates for your total. </notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight, English edition (out of print).  Includes two decks (Vulca and Hoax), plus a gameboard and three plastic dragon figurines.  And a rulebook.
Note: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; decks.  The Blue Moon decks were each released with a couple cards missing, which could only be found by purchasing a different deck.  I bought all the Blue Moon cards and matched them up with the appropriate decks.  So my Vulca deck contains ALL of the Vulca cards and ONLY Vulca cards, for example.
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bit of a crease on the box top but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s structurally sound.  Components are in perfect condition.
I also have the Mimix, Terrah, Khind, Blessings, and Allies decks for sale.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll part with the entire set for $45.
Shipping Priority Mail from 48105, and I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tack on a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;handling fee_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; like some of the other sellers.</notes>

Includes:
- Base Game [Hoax, Vulca]
- Mimix
- Khind
- Flit
- Terrah
- Pillar [HARD TO FIND]
- Aqua [HARD TO FIND]
- E_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;I: Allies
- E_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;I: Blessings
- Buka Invasion
Plus 3 copies [will double-check on request] each of the 3 English promo cards [Water Spirit, Fire Spirit, Earth Spirit]. There are enough for each deck to have one, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve just distributed them pseudo-thematically for now; you can obviously do whatever you want with them. 
Mimix is the only deck that really shows any wear, and it is very light, just _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;played_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Pillar and Aqua, in particular, are in great shape; played once/twice each.
Also included as a bonus:
- More Knizia 2p goodness in the form of Ingenious: Travel Edition
Will pay first $5 shipping within continental U.S. [the game is neither large nor particularly heavy; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d expect your part of the shipping cost to be $5-7].</notes>

    <notes>Entire Blue Moon set - Base game plus all nine expansion decks.
The base game has been played a few times but is in great shape with no noticable wear.  A few of the expansion decks have been played once, some not at all.  All are also in excellent shape (two are still in shrink).
I have a card box that holds 7 decks very nicely.  It also has a partitioned-off section (leftover space because of the unusual dimensions of the cards) that could hold the dragon tokens if you wished.  Currently, the Aqua, Flit, Khind, Mimix, Pillar, Terrah, and Buka Invasion decks are in this box, along with dividers.  There are also dividers for the base game decks if you wanted to swap them into the box.  They seven expansion decks in the box no longer have their original packaging. (In truth, I think I actually have the original boxes for the expansion decks in a box in my attic, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only going go digging around up there if it is really important to you.)
The base game is complete in its original packaging.
The Emissaries _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Inquisitors: Allies and Emissaries _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Inquisitors: Blessings decks are still new in shrink wrap.
Shipping will be $10.00.</notes>

    <notes>999 Games - Blue Moon
Language: Dutch
Players: 2
Age: 12+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.575 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.
See Details (more info) or below for complete selling, payment and shipping conditions.</notes>

For simplicities sake, I prefer payment by Paypal and will ship via USPS Medium Flat Rate Priority to the Continental US.  International buyers are welcome, but shipping will have to be calculated at order confirmation based on any requests.  If nothings specific is requested, I usually use the most inexpensive USPS service offered.  I charge only what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m charged for shipping.
Feel free to browse the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling.  I will combine shipping and have been known to offer discounts of 10%-30% to multiple-game buyers depending on how many games and how much is being spent.
If you have any questions, including requests for games from my collection you might also be interested in buying, feel free to geekmail me.
Thanks,
Brian

    <notes>This is a copy of Blue Moon, with a couple expansions.
However, none of the card sets is complete, but almost complete (got this in an ebay auction the way it stands). There are enough cards to form sets of 30 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Vulca_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hoax_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Terrah_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Flit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, making the game perfectly playable with four factions.
The following paragraphs explain what the state of each element is.
Base Set:
What is in the box is in quite good condition. Cards, manual, and board are not bent or damaged. Board has a cosmetic scratch in the back.
The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;turn order_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; game reference cards are not included. These are nice, but in no way required to play, the manual has all the required explanations.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Vulca_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deck has 29 out of the original 31 cards. It is missing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mimix_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 06 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Heroine of the Great Plains_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mutant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 106 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Zig-nur-Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. There are enough _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Vulca_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the other expansions and extra cards to complete a 30 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Vulca_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set.
 
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Hoax_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deck has 30 out of the original 31 cards. It is missing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mutant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 105 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Var-dis-Nar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. There are enough _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hoax_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the other expansions and extra cards to complete a 30 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hoax_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set.
Expansions:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Terrah_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deck has 30 out of the original 31 cards. It is missing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mutant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card 107 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ras-mus-pan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The tuck box is in Ok shape, but not great. There are enough _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Terrah_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the other expansions and extra cards to complete a 30 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Terrah_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Flit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deck has 30 out of the original 31 cards. It is missing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mutant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card 109 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fel-nar-Gan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The tuck box is in Ok shape, but not great. There are enough _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Flit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards in the other expansions and extra cards to complete a 30 card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Flit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set.
I did pack all the sets in the numeric order they come in originally from Fantasy of Flight. Note there are gaps in the numbering of each set, but that is the way FFG distributed them (you will notice some of the sets include cards for other sets, it was a marketing strategy to get you to buy the additional sets).
Additionally there are 29 cards from other various expansions. These can be used to complete or spice up the other decks as you see fit. These do not have a tuck box of their own, I will put them on an envelope.
I am almost tempted to keep these instead of selling them since you have four complete decks, but I already have a full collection of the Blue Moon game (save for a couple hard to get promos) and I promised myself I would sell this lot.
Take advantage of this opportunity to get a playable copy of a great two player game for a fraction of the price it would cost you to get one at market prices. 
If you send me a geekmail with your address, I will let you know the shipping cost. I usually like to use _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Flat Rate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; boxes and this should fit in one of the $10.95 if you want a rough estimate of the possible price.</notes>

    <notes>999 Games - Blue Moon
Language: Dutch
Players: 2
Age: 12+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.575 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.
See Details (more info) or below for complete selling, payment and shipping conditions.

CONDITION DETAILS:
The first four expansions are new in shrink.  Emissaries _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Inquisitors; Blessings has a ding on the side, but is still perfectly functional. The cards inside are in excellent, unplayed condition.
The box for the base game has shelf wear in the form of scuffs on the edges of the underside of the box. Also, some white is showing on the corners of the top of the box. The components inside are played, but complete and in very good to excellent condition. The only wear I can find is that you can tell the game rules have been read over and used in a few games, but not damaged or abused.
Items are from a smoke-free, pet-free home.
$15 Shipping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Handling in USA
International shipping also available.  Please, inquire in advance.</notes>

Buyer pays shipping, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to anywhere I can launch a package to (I think I sent Netrunner cards to the moon once.)
Will take any reasonable form of payment, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got to have the money before I send the product, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had checks bounce before.

    <notes>For Loquitur only!
If you are looking for a fun, fast, tense, two-player game, look no further!  Designed by Reiner Knizia,  this game has sadly been out of print for several years.  I was lucky enough to pick it up when it was still available; even luckier, my girlfriend liked the game the couple of times we played.  Alas, circumstances are currently such that I could use the money (to spend on travel visiting said lady, who is now an ocean away) more than I could use the game sitting on my shelf, neglected.
Cards are all in like-new condition (they were all sleeved before playing with any of the decks; sleeves included).
Includes the base game (the Hoax and the Vulca), and all the expansion decks:
The Aqua
Buka Invasion
The Flit
The Khind
The Mimix
The Pillar
The Terrah
Emissaries and Inquisitors - Allies
Emissaries and Inquisitors - Blessings
(I have all the boxes for the expansions except the Buka Invasion, too, which I can include if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.)
Finally, as a bonus, I acquired three promotional cards:
Fire Spirit 
Water Spirit
Earth Spirit.  
These aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sleeved, because they haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played with.
Shipping: the price I pay to Canada Post, FedEx, or UPS (your choice of company and method) is the price you pay. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge extra for handling or packing materials. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere in the world (yes, that includes Brazil)... but all buyers should be aware that I assume no liability for parcels when they leave my hands. Insurance recommended, particularly for international buyers.
Payment: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an L5R addict, and I buy my booster boxes at CoolStuffInc.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d therefore prefer a CSI GC, but Paypal is fine too.
Miscellaneous: BGG will receive its 3%, of course. Item will ship within 3 days of payment clearing. Any questions, please feel free to PM!</notes>
