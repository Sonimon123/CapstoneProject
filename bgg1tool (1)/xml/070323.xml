   <description>In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack. Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>IELLO (IEL 51032)
King of Tokyo is a game from Richard Garfield for 2 to 6 players in which you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and other aliens; all of whom are happily whacking each other in a joyous atmosphere in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo. Each turn, throw six dice. The dice bear the following six symbols: 1, 2 or 3 Points of Destruction, Energy, Healing and Whack. In three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win destruction points, hoard energy, restore health, or whack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory. The fiercest player will be crowned King of Tokyo... and will end up facing all the other monsters alone! Top this off with special cards, purchased with energy, that have a permanent or temporary effect: such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s one of the most explosive games of the year! In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 destruction points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.</notes>

    <notes>IELLO (IEL51032)
King of Tokyo is a game from Richard Garfield for 2 to 6 players in which you will be able to play mutant monsters gigantic robots and other aliens all of whom are happily whacking each other in a joyous atmosphere in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo. When it is your turn to play you throw six dice. Each die bears the following six symbols: 1 2 or 3 Points of Destruction Energy Healing and Whack. In three successive throws you are going to choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to come up with combinations that will enable you to win destruction points hoard energy restore your health or whack other players into understanding Tokyo is your territory. The fiercest player will be crowned King of Tokyo and will end up facing all the other monsters alone! Top this off with special cards that you can purchase with energy and that have a permanent or temporary effect such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die body armor nova death ray and more and you hold one of the most explosive games of the year! In order to win the game one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 destruction points or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended. </notes>

    <notes>Acceptable condition. Game has been played only 3-4 times, and the actual components show little to no wear. 
The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rating reflect some minor issues with the game box. Specifically, the box top has a partial (1/2-inch) split on one corner. And, the box top and bottom have a dent/crease that runs a few inches one edge. The dent was present when the game was purchased new. The actual game pieces were unaffected by whatever caused this dent; though, the rule sheet did suffer a little wrinkling along one edge.
Payment can be made either though paypal or amazon giftcard. Buyer to pay actual shipping from 95008. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to arrange for local pickup in San Jose, CA, as well.</notes>

    <notes>This game is great and has seen a lot of use and a lot of laughs.  As a result the cards are slightly faded around the edges and the rulebook is quite well thumbed and has some dents from where the chunky dice have been rolled on it!
My group tends to want to play heavier games these days and so this doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see the table much anymore.
Price includes second class recorded postage to the UK.
If you are outside the UK and are interested then drop me a message and we can discuss shipping.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a bundle of the following King of Tokyo games/expansions (as seen in photo):
- King of Tokyo (English second edition with 3 awards) (2012)
- King of Tokyo: Power Up (English first edition) (2012)
- King of Tokyo: Promo Cards (English first edition) (2011)
All cards come sleeved and have been sleeved for as long as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had the game. (Note: the square evolution cards from Power Up are not sleeved but are in Like New condition.) The only wear and tear is on the base game box and some light scuffing on the monster boards. Comes from a smoke free home.
Shipping (from 15209) will default to USPS Priority and I will provide you with the cost based on the destination. I accept Paypal, Popmoney, and Venmo.</notes>
