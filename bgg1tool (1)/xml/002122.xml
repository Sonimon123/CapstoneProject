   <description>Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;prey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;predator_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;ousting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;pool_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor!

    <notes>A collection of 766 Jyhad cards (original WOTC ediction with the Jyhad card backs.
There are 447 commons, and at least 1 of each common present. 115 uncommons, some duplicates and missing 16 of the uncommons.  164 vitals, including at least one of each vital (which also means there is at least one of every Vampire). 31 rares (28 unique rares).  My count may be off slightly and there were some differences between the Jyhad and Vampire versions of this first set of cards that may have confused my counts of about four or five cards.  Complete listing of cards availabe as excel file upon request.
The cards are lightly played but most have never been played.  I note for the collectors seeking pristine cards that there is a very, very slight bow to the cards due to the way they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve settled in their card box over the years (this should be a nonissue to players or dabblers and maybe even some collectors).
Shipping will be $9 by USPS priority mail and I will get delivery confirmation as well.
