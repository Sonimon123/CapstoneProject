   <description>Prince John is coming to Nottingham! Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit. However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate? Declare your goods, negotiate deals, and be on the lookout for the Sheriff of Nottingham!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sheriff of Nottingham is the first game in the Dice Tower Essentials Line from Arcane Wonders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s impossible for a merchant to make a living anymore, being taxed as much as we are. Now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got the greedy Sheriff of Nottingham checking everyone who comes through the front gate for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;contraband_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - meaning all the good stuff he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trying to keep for himself! Good thing you know the Sheriff better than Prince John does. That shifty, no-good, greedy fellow might be intimidating when he stands in front of the city gate, but let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s be honest, he is not above taking a well-placed bribe to look the other way. You have come to Nottingham with your Goods on market day, and the only thing standing between you and your hard-earned profits is the Sheriff. All you need to do is bluff or bribe your way past him... or maybe, tell the truth! The Sheriff of Nottingham is a fun and engaging game for all where each player will have the chance to be the Sheriff himself! As peasants, players will declare goods they wish to bring into the city and it will be up to the Sheriff to decide who is telling the truth and who is secretly trying to smuggle in contraband!

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Here ye, here ye! By order of the honorable Prince John, beginning this day, all merchants must halt upon arrival to Nottingham and declare forth their goods entering the city!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Prince John_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lust for gold has finally gone too far! It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s impossible for a merchant to make a living anymore, being taxed as much as we are. Now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got the greedy Sheriff of Nottingham checking everyone who comes through the front gate for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;contraband_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - meaning all the good stuff he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trying to keep for himself! Good thing you know the Sheriff better than Prince John does. That shifty, no-good, greedy fellow might be intimidating when he stands in front of the city gate, but let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s be honest, he is not above taking a well-placed bribe to look the other way. You have come to Nottingham with your Goods on market day, and the only thing standing between you and your hard-earned profits is the Sheriff. All you need to do is bluff or bribe your way past him... or maybe, tell the truth! The Sheriff of Nottingham is a fun and engaging game for all where each player will have the chance to be the Sheriff himself! As peasants, players will declare goods they wish to bring into the city and it will be up to the Sheriff to decide who is telling the truth and who is secretly trying to smuggle in contraband! Experience Nottingham in a whole new way! Declare your goods, deal with the Sheriff and secure victory in a fun-filled and exciting adventure!</notes>

    <notes>Arcane Wonders (AWGDTE01SN)
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Here ye, here ye! By order of the honorable Prince John, beginning this day, all merchants must halt upon arrival to Nottingham and declare forth their goods entering the city!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Prince John_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s lust for gold has finally gone too far! It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s impossible for a merchant to make a living anymore, being taxed as much as we are. Now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got the greedy Sheriff of Nottingham checking everyone who comes through the front gate for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;contraband_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - meaning all the good stuff he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trying to keep for himself! Good thing you know the Sheriff better than Prince John does. That shifty, no-good, greedy fellow might be intimidating when he stands in front of the city gate, but let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s be honest, he is not above taking a well-placed bribe to look the other way. You have come to Nottingham with your Goods on market day, and the only thing standing between you and your hard-earned profits is the Sheriff. All you need to do is bluff or bribe your way past him... or maybe, tell the truth! The Sheriff of Nottingham is a fun and engaging game for all where each player will have the chance to be the Sheriff himself! As peasants, players will declare goods they wish to bring into the city and it will be up to the Sheriff to decide who is telling the truth and who is secretly trying to smuggle in contraband! Experience Nottingham in a whole new way! Declare your goods, deal with the Sheriff and secure victory in a fun-filled and exciting adventure!</notes>

This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail. </notes>

    <notes>Listing price is for the base game which I am only asking $8.95
However, there is an optional add-on bundle available with this purchase which is listed below:
- Official Playmat
- Prince John_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Sword Promo Card
- Royal Summons Promo Card
- Extra set of bags of each color
I am only asking an additional $14.95 for all these extras with the purchase of the base game. 
This collection is in top notch shape with only the base game being opened and sorted but never played. Everything else is sealed and in card protectors having never been played either.
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t miss out on some very RARE items in this bundle, some of which are out of print!!
Check out my other listings to combine _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; save on shipping!

    <notes>Played twice. Popper from the yellow bag had come loose and has been reinserted, so works fine if careful. This seems to be a common problem with the bags based on comments online and happened on our first play. Everything else in like new condition bar some slight rulebook scuffing.

    <notes>1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>
