   <description>(from GMT website :)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Normandy '44 is a 2, 3, or 4-player, regimental level game of the D-Day landings on June 6th and the battles that raged in Normandy for the next 21 days. During this crucial period the Germans had their only chance to push back the Allied invasion before the preponderance of Allied men and material made the outcome certain. During this period, the U.S. 1st Army fought across the Cotentin Peninsula and captured the major port of Cherbourg while British forces took on the bulk of of the German panzer divisions near Caen._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game uses a simplified Ardennes '44 system: Move, Fight and Reserve Movement. All non-tank battalion units are rated for Troop Quality, while all armor units have a Tank Rating. In each battle these ratings are used to provide shifts for either the attacker or defender. Other important shifts are provided by air power, naval support, artillery and/or Tiger tanks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game includes a 22 turn Campaign game, a 7-turn Tournament Scenario that focuses on the Allies linking up the beaches, and a scenario covering the battle in the peninsula and the capture of Cherbourg. In addition, there are rules for allowing 3 or even 4 players to play the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Turn: 1 day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Map: approx 2.3 miles /3.8 km per hex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unit: Battalions to Brigades_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Contents:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two countersheets (456 9/16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; dual-side printed counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 32 page rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two Combat _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Terrain Player Aid Cards (2 sided)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four Set-up/Reinforcement Cards (three 1-sided, one 2-sided)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity: low to intermediate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: 3 hours_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Box opened, contents looked at.  Rules flipped through. Box closed, put on shelf.  All counters unpunched.  All contents in prestine condition.  Non-smoking, pet free home.
Shipping: the price I pay to Canada Post, FedEx, or UPS (your choice of company and method) is the price you pay. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge extra for handling or packing materials. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere in the world (yes, that includes Brazil)... but all buyers should be aware that I assume no liability for parcels when they leave my hands. Insurance recommended... particularly for international buyers.
Payment: I am an L5R addict, and I typically buy my booster boxes through CoolStuffInc, so I would prefer a CSI Gift Certificate. If the buyer would prefer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also accept Paypal, provided the buyer covers any fee that may apply.
Miscellaneous: BGG will receive its 3%, of course. Item will ship within 3 days of payment clearing. Any questions, please feel free to PM!</notes>

    <notes>Unplayed. Unpunched. Opened. Rules read a couple of times. Map laid out under glass for a while. The box has very minor scuffing in a few places, but nothing unusual from regular storage and moving around. Otherwise, the box is in excellent shape. And, again, counters unpunched. I played someone else_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy at GMT East a couple of years ago and really enjoyed the game. I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to play anything right now except for kids games with my kids. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather see someone else enjoying this than having it sit unplayed in my games closet. I will ship the game via USPS in a medium flat rate box.</notes>

Buyer pays actual shipping from the 95051 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of war games. Mostly GMT.

Normandy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 is a 2, 3, or 4-player, regimental level game of the D-Day landings on June 6th and the battles that raged in Normandy for the next 21 days. During this crucial period the Germans had their only chance to push back the Allied invasion before the preponderance of Allied men and material made the outcome certain. During this period, the U.S. 1st Army fought across the Cotentin Peninsula and captured the major port of Cherbourg while British forces took on the bulk of the German panzer divisions near Caen. Each turn represents 1 day. Each hex represents 3.8 kilometers (or 2.3 miles). Most units are regiments or brigades though most of the armor units are represented as battalions. The game uses a simplified Ardennes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 system: Move, Fight and Reserve Movement. All non-tank battalion units are rated for Troop Quality, while all armor units have a Tank Rating. In each battle these ratings are used to provide shifts for either the attacker or defender. Other important shifts are provided by air power, naval support, artillery and/or Tiger tanks. The game includes a 22 turn Campaign game, a 7-turn Tournament Scenario that focuses on the Allies linking up the beaches, and a scenario covering the battle in the peninsula and the capture of Cherbourg. In addition, there are rules for allowing 3 or even 4 players to play the game.</notes>

During this crucial period the Germans had their only chance to push back the Allied invasion before the preponderance of Allied men and material made the outcome certain. During this period, the U.S. 1st Army fought across the Cotentin Peninsula and captured the major port of Cherbourg while British forces took on the bulk of the German panzer divisions near Caen. Each turn represents 1 day. Each hex represents 3.8 kilometers (or 2.3 miles). Most units are regiments or brigades though most of the armor units are represented as battalions. The game uses a simplified Ardennes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 system: Move, Fight and Reserve Movement. All non-tank battalion units are rated for Troop Quality, while all armor units have a Tank Rating. In each battle these ratings are used to provide shifts for either the attacker or defender. Other important shifts are provided by air power, naval support, artillery and/or Tiger tanks. The game includes a 22 turn Campaign game, a 7-turn Tournament Scenario that focuses on the Allies linking up the beaches, and a scenario covering the battle in the peninsula and the capture of Cherbourg. In addition, there are rules for allowing 3 or even 4 players to play the game.</notes>

    <notes>Am selling my LIKE NEW copy of GMT’s Normandy 44 to make room for new games.  A great way to game the D-Day landings with a reasonable footprint and scale.  Truly a classic D-Day game.
This game is in LIKE NEW im-mac-u-late shape. Rule book crisp and never used (I make a copy of the living rules to use and mark up). Counters are carefully trimmed and includes a free counter tray.  This game comes from a smoke-free, game-loving home and there is no musty smell.  This game is currently out of print and it could be quite a while before it gets reprinted.  Nab it now before it gets harder to find and more expensive to own.
I have been a BGG member for years, but only sold a few times on BGG. You can see my buyer/seller feedback on eBay, seller ID _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;houlie63_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. 
Shipment via USPS Priority Mail flat rate medium box. This method includes tracking information so you can track progress to your destination. Reach out to me if you require a different shipping method or have any questions prior to purchase. Thanks!</notes>
