   <description>From the publisher: Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors. The player with the most victory points is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - This copy has had the shrinkwrap removed from the box but it has never been played.  Everything is unpunched.
I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion (most likely USPS flat rate box). Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.
This game is heavy!  I am going to charge $9 for shipping which is slightly less than what it will cost to ship.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG AD01)
Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and inner demons.
Android_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just as human as anyone else?
Whomever you choose to play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons. Better get moving, detective.
Android is a game for 3-5 players and takes between 2-4 hours to play.</notes>

Game has been played but wear and tear is minimal. It is complete apart from one missing Trauma counter (marked _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-1 VP_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;). However this is not a problem, there are still twelve _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Trauma counters, plus five _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Trauma counters, which is plenty. The look and play of the game is unaffected.
All other parts are present and in good condition. The game is still very presentable and the box is not scuffed or damaged.
Also I have bagged up the cards and pieces specific to each character separately, for ease of setting up the game.
Please use Paypal if ordering by post.</notes>

    <notes>Punched and thoroughly organized, but never played.  Includes some laminated reference sheets and a handmade tuck box.  Outer box has some shelf wear and minor dings on the corners but everything inside is pristine.  Whatever insert was there I have tossed though.
I have organized all of the non-player-specific components very nicely using a double-sided Plano case that is yours for an extra $7.  Otherwise I will put the components into a few baggies (but be warned, there are a ton of components in this game).  Ask for a picture if you are interested.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGAD01)
Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and inner demons. Android_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just as human as anyone else? Whomever you choose to play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons. Better get moving, detective. </notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGAD01)
Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and inner demons. Android_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just as human as anyone else? Whomever you choose to play, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons. Better get moving, detective. </notes>

    <notes>I would describe the parts and board as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as the game has only been played twice.  However, the bottom of the box was scruffed quite a bit by the satchel I carried the game around in for some time.  I did not realize this until part of the image was gone.
Aside from this one issue, the game is perfect.  Everything is included of course; nothing is missing from the original contents. 
Offers welcome, including international buyers.</notes>

Shipping is from Burbank (91504) or can arrange for local pickup if you live around Los Angeles. As an estimate, shipping from Burbank to New York City was just over $12. No packaging/handling fees. Will combine with my other game sales for better deal on shipping.

*PLEASE READ*
I am sending a Marketplace order for each item. If you have won multiple games, you will get multiple orders. You can purchase each one individually or wait to purchase them all at once. This will not change shipping cost. All combined shipping orders will be exact cost. If you won only one item you will pay the listed shipping cost as described in that item.

The pieces have been carefully punched, rules booklet lightly read - attempted to play solo only a couple of times.
100% complete
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll post a few pictures here at some point..

    <notes>*** With every sale we donate a percentage to the Veterans Support Foundation (including this sale). ***
Wargame Depot has donated over $8,000 to this wonderful cause thanks, largely, to the wonderful Boardgamegeek community. Thank you so much for your continued support of Wargame Depot which has allowed us to give generously to the VSF.
Excellent condition copy available. Played once. No dings, no dents, or anything wrong with the game. Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
$12 shipping to US - write me for a quote to the rest of the world.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so a purchase from me will always be packed professionally and I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
And if you want this game plus anything else that I am selling on BGG, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course be happy to add other items on in order to save you on shipping!
North Carolina residents pay 7% sales tax.
Cheers,

We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re tracking you in free fall.
Postage costs will vary depending on your location. In the U.K. I normally use MyHermes as they can collect from my location - not all of the couriers do.
The cost of shipping within the U.K. is normally between £5-£10 depending on the weight of the game - most of the regular sized (square box) games I am selling tend to be in the 2-5kg category.
I always ship with tracking information and enough insurance to cover the cost of the game.
Please contact me for a postage quote before purchasing the game.</notes>
