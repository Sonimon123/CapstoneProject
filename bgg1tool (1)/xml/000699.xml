   <description>HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests.  Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable.  Expansions were also released for this system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Additional material which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Other sources of HeroQuest supplements which are available (in some cases online.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;

    <notes>A very good copy of HeroQuest that I only rank good because of the box, which shows some edge wear (no split corners though).  The actual contents are in complete, very good condition, with a couple of the empty doorframes very slightly bent and some of the dice a bit worn but no other issues.  
Otherwise there are plenty of character sheets left, and the cards/furniture are in pristine, mint condition.  I even still have the advertising for other HQ expansions and all the other promotional materials that came with the game inside.
I played this game maybe five times and it has been stored safely in my basement for the past few years.  None of my friends at home nor my current game group is interested in playing this, so I decided to offer it up here.  Will ship to both U.S. and Canada, with payment via BidPay ONLY since I cannot take PayPal payments (being a Canadian resident and all).
I will charge exact costs for shipping, no overhead, no handling, just what it costs me to get it to you.  The game is currently securely packaged and ready to ship and costs are going to be around $12 for basic ground and about $17 for Xpresspost plus insurance.  Buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s choice on that one.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;d just like to see this game find its way to someplace where it will actually get used, so here it is!</notes>

    <notes>This is HeroQuest PLUS the Witch Lord Expansion. The box is in pretty bad shape, but the contents are complete and in excellent to good condition.  The giant gargoyle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wings are broken, but both parts are there, (nothing a little super glue won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fix). Also, the artifact cards that came with the expansion have had parts of their text marked out with a felt-tip, though the text is in the quest book. Some of the open and closed doors are bent up, from someone putting them in a bit too vigorously. Pictures available upon request.
Due to the size of the game, an additional charge will be added to the shipping for a box to ship it in. This will be  $4.23.

    <notes>Hi! sorry but this game is incomplete but still playable or used for parts! I got this one extra for parts now since the last ASSHOLE sold it to me incomplete and didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t refund me any money. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m keeping the other set. Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your opportunity to own a cheap version of it and see if you like it. If you like it then go ahead and buy a good set. Most sellers who say its 100% are usually full of it, like the asshole who sold this one to me which I now use for spare parts. I got a lot of those and they end up missing something and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not going to lie about it. As a collector I know how it feels to get burned. Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what is in this incomplete set. It includes: BOX, Gameboard, GM screen, Quest book, Instructions, the identification guide, pad of character sheets, 2 monster cards, 3 earth 3 fire 3 water 3 air spell cards, 10 artifact cards, 12 chaos cards, 24 treasure cards,4 character cards, one white die and one red die, 6 white combat dice, 1 wizard, 1 chaos sorc, 4 chaos warriors, 4 skeletons, 2 mummies, 2 zombies, 3 fimirs, 5 goblins, 8 orcs, 1 scale, 1 bottle, 5 skulls, 3 rats, 3 chests, 1 fireplace, 2 tables, 1 throne, 1 rack with 2 arms, 1 sorcs table, 2 book shelves, 1 cupboard, 1 weap rack, 1 tomb, 1 alchemist table, 19 door stands, 5 closed doors, 15 open doors, 2 two tiled square block, 11 skull tiles, 6 pit trap tiles, 4 secret door tiles, 1 blocked square tile. These tiles are have different variety backs so they can be used for other things too like a replacement. the skull tiles can be flipped over for blocked squares and pit traps can be fliped over for secret doors or blocked squares and so on. WITHIN US SHIPPING IS $10.00. Let me know if you want insurance and delivery confirm, etc... Shipping to Canada is $15.00 and the rest of the world is $21.00. U.S. insurance $2.00 while rest of the world is $4.00. Thank you and take care</notes>

Everything inside the box is pristine. Models, Dice, Props, etc. are all like brand new. A few of the character sheets were used on the first play.
$30.00
 
AS a note:
----------
I also have the first 2 expansions(unplayed). Return of the Witch Lord and Kellars Keep. 
Most everything is unpunched(a few items either were or became loose)
There is some box scuffing from moving and storing, but the Boxs not dented or bent.
Everything inside is pristine and like new(is new).
I can provide these 2 as a packaged deal with the main game for $70.00 if anyone is interested.

The game looks complete and is in pretty good condition, though a few of the furniture pieces may have breaks here and there (I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think the candle stick scenery survived a decade on my shelf).  I have the Keller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Keep box and will include it, though the Witch Lord box is absent.  Buyer pay shipping, contact me with any questions.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Contains the basic set, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; four expansions (including Elf and Barbarian hard-to-find expansions).  All in the main box.  All expansion boxes were ditched.
Game materials need some desciption.  The core set materials have been used the most.  The dice are badly worn, and the core cards show heavy use.  The skeletons and goblins have been altered and crudely painted (they were once fielded as Blood Bowl teams).
The expansion stuff is in better shape.  The expansion boxes were tossed long ago (sorry).  But all contents are present, and in good shape.
Everything is present to the best of my knowledge.
Somewhat heavy package.</notes>

    <notes>Base game in very good to good condition. Cards, tiles, figures, etc. are 100% complete, correct, and in great shape – even the candles and weapons rack are perfect. All cardboard components are straight and crisp. The rules and quest bookets show a little use. Plastic components show very little, if any stress. Only a few sheets have been used from the character pad. Box has very slight dishing on top with only a little shelfwear.</notes>

    <notes>Used copy of Heroquest. Most of the minis are painted, some of the monster minis are damaged (sword tip broken off of orcs, etc). As a bonus I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including the 2 double sided boards from the game Dragon Strike which let you run adventures in Caves, a Castle, a City, and the outdoors, AND all of the miniatures from Dragon Strike which would let you homebrew lots more monsters and characters. Buyer pays shipping based on their location. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling other games on BGG and would be happy to combine on shipping for multiple items- so take a look at my other stuff! Have a great day.

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Milton Bradley, 1989-1990 - HeroQuest - COMPLETE. Outer box has some normal shelf wear (particularly in the corners) with creases in (3) corners (not unusual with boxes this size).  (1) crease runs the length of a short side on the cover.  (2) of the edges (long side) have tears from tape removal (about 2.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 3.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; respectfully) and cover bows slightly.  Interior contents are in very good condition.  Board is very crisp with no signs of stains or tears.  All printed material (cards, instructions, quest) are very clean and solid.  All characters are complete with no stress or fatigue to the plastic (as well as the furniture, candles, weapons rack - all intact)  NOTE: white dice show the most wear, also, there are numerous doors that have creases in them (around 13).  The game appears to have been opened, put together but never played.  Bottom box has more shelf wear and a tear in the graphics from tape removal (about 5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; at widest point).  Also, there is some price tag residue (about .5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x .5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 5.5 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon</notes>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Milton Bradley, 1989-1990 - HeroQuest - COMPLETE. Outer Box is in very good condition with only very minimal shelfwear and (1) taped corner. There is also a small piece of sticker residue on the cover (about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 0.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).  Box graphics still look very vibrant.  Interior contents are in very good condition.  Board is crisp and clean.  Quest guide, screen, character sheets, instructions and cards appear to all be in very solid shape with no noticable creases or wear.  All plastic figures are intact and have no noticable stress or plastic fatigue.  Furniture pieces are in good condition with numerous skulls and rats - the doorways do not seem to have any noticeable creases.  Note: the candlesticks from the sorcerer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s table are broken and missing.  The armory (insert) also has (1) crease in the top right corner (about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in lenth).  Bottom box has some slight shelfwear and a crease in (1) of the corners (top right)(about 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length) and some slight creases toward the bottom right (not bad but needs mentioned). See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 5.5 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address.

    <notes>Hero Quest Game System, SEALED !!!!!!
for other informations and shipping costs please ask.
 
Heroquest versione USA (Game System) INCELLOFANATO, una vera rarità; la versione USA dell_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Heroquest europeo di Barker si presenta più curata nella grafica delle carte, dove sono presenti a differenza della versione europea le magie del caos, e in più una scatola sicuramente più comoda di quella un po esile dell_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;heroquest europeo.
da segnalare: la scatola mostra qualche segno sugli spigoli, c_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;è un piccolo foro sul coperchio
sono disponibili i file con le traduzioni di istruzioni e libro delle imprese (anche se poi sono quasi gli stessi della versione europea, con qualche differenza però)
per altre info contattatemi pure
possibilità di spedizioni combinate con altri oggetti

* Damaged pieces: The gargoyle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wings have been broken, and a number of orcs and goblins have their weapons broken off. Two of the goblins have been broken off their bases, but can be easily glued back on.
*The cardboard components are pretty good for the age, I sorted out good ones from the pile.
*Cards are all present, aged, worn, but decent.
*Rulebook and Quest Book are in good condition, board_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s good, the screen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s decent.
*Dice are worn, but discernable.
Shipping within Australia will cost $12
*Please note that the two broken goblins and the broken gargoyle have been blue-tacked in the images. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll glue them if my glue arrives in the post before this is bought.

This is for the main game and the quest pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Return of the Witch Lord_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Main game:
Box has pretty worn corners, no edges split though.  Some edges have some nicks but for the most part the box is in quite good shape considering it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age.  All components present and look to be in great shape.
Expansion:
Box has minor wear to the corners but is in better condition than the main game box.  All components verified as present and in excellent condition.</notes>

    <notes>This is a nice unpunched copy of the game. The box has a decent amount of shelf wear on it, as well as some soft denting on the underside, otherwise it is in good condition. A few of the plastic bits have fallen off their sprues, but otherwise are all in place.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to accept a money order or PayPal, although I would ask that you add 2% to the total cost if you decide to use PayPal.

    <notes>Over all, a really, really nice example of this game.  About as good as you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re ever likely to find, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d say.  One monster has a broken sword.  The box lid sags ever so slightly in the middle, like something was stored on top of it at some point, but I certainly wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t call it crushed.  Box shows extremely minor, light wear.  All pieces present and accounted for.  Someone took really good care of this game.

Milton Bradley, developed with Games Workshop
1990
Game is NOT COMPLETE.  Components are in good, but not perfect, condition.  Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the rundown:
31 monsters; 4 heroes; 15 pieces of furniture - some of the assembled pieces are starting to come apart; of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;miscellaneous items_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, only 1 rat and 1 candlestick are included - not bottles, scales, or skulls; 21 doors (5 closed, 16 open); 66 Playing Cards - worn but playable; 1 Gameboard; 1 Instruction booklet; 1 Quest Book; only 3 of 4 Character Cards - the Wizard is missing; 1 Information Screen; 1 Pad of Character Sheets; 6 White Combat Dice; 2 Red Dice; and a supply of Cardboard Tiles.
Box has no split corners.  It is slightly crushed and has general wear and tear.</notes>

    <notes>This is a fantastic player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy- the box has seen better days (ripped edge, discolored, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; tape), but the pieces are all in great condition. The only exceptions I could find were a single orc with a broken scimitar, and the board is VERY slightly warped, but you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even notice unless you looked for it. Just trying to be thorough! Plenty of character pads left.

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition and is complete including the quest book and rulebook (both in great condition, appear to have never really been used). The dice are still sealed in their original bag. The cards are in near mint/mint condition and a quick glance of all the miniatures, furniture and other pieces show everything to be looking amazing! The only thing noteworthy is on the bottom of most mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bases is a piece of tape with the type of creature that figure is, not even noticeable during play since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s underneath the base.  Just wanted to mention it, but other than that, the game looks sharp! Box is in very good condition with no split corners! </notes>

    <notes>Okay, this is my set, collected over years. All of the original contents, plus Witchlord, Kellar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Keep, a TON of excess plastic figures, cards and furniture. 
Several PDF booklets printed out and stapled. The HQ magazine printed out in PDF format. The White Dwarf article (or one of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em). Tons of extra tiles, cards and doors!
The only thing missing is the original rulebook. This set is massive and is barely contained by the original box its so stuffed! Extra wizards, extra warriors, and an extra demon, with wings!
Some (a relative few) figures have some painting begun, but 90% or more are fresh and unplayed. </notes>

Game materials are in very good condition with some wear (a couple cardboard doors are beginning to bend).  The pad of character sheets has only a few missing.

    <notes>This game is in really nice shape. The cards have been played with only a few times and are crisp and white. The board and all minis are presents. Some of the skulls may be missing from time but that does not affect the game at all. None of the pieces are broken and I can not find any major issues with the contents. The box is not in the greatest shape. It does have some denting but nothing is busted or taped. It may have some numbers written on the side.</notes>

    <notes>Heroquest + first two expansions:
- Kellars Keep
- Return of the Witch Lord
The base HQ game is incomplete but all the item that are there are in excellent condition. The box is excellent condition (see photo). Missing pieces are:
- 1 Orc
- 1 cardboard open door
- 1 2x1 cardboard _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;blocked_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; marker.
Both expansions are complete and in good condition except that with Lair of the Witch Lord someone has begun painting some of the figures (see picture). It is not a bad job, just unfinished.</notes>

------------------------------------------------------
Really nice copy, never played or played once at most and hand counted to verify 100% complete, every rat, every skull it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there. 
Components like new condition, Cards crisp and straight as are the rules and are unused. All the minis are perfect and no broken pieces same with the furniture candles intact etc and nothing painted, dice again look new, map etc. Character Sheets look full but a few could be missing, a couple of open doors were bent during storage. 
Box is in exc shape for its age; corners shows wear, a few small creases and very light markings, overall less than moderate for age and very solid with no splits. 
Can send pictures if wanted.
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping, feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted nothing more and the method of your choice.

*Quest book missing, but print out of it included, Sorcerer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Table is intact with candles but is missing the cardboard base, rack has broken spindles, a few figures are (fairly badly) painted.  Obviously none of this affects gameplay.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS IN GREAT CONDITION (just wanted to be thorough)

    <notes>A very nice copy overall, looks like never played or played once. Pieces were hand counted to verify 100% complete, every rat, every skull it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there. 
Components are in like new condition mostly, Board, rules, minis all excellent and no broken swords etc on minis. The only flaws in components are the following:  Cards show some aging with slight discolouring but otherwise look unused. Some open doors have been bent from storage (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen this in every copy very common). One of the two candles on the Altar has a small piece broken off top (again very common). One die is a little faded, its likely a replacement as all others look completely new and unused. All other components are in excellent unused condition.  
Box is in great shape for its age and very solid; corners shows some wear, a few small creases and very light markings, some slight bubbling and one small piece of masking tape on one side. Overall less than moderate wear for age (22 years!) and very solid with no splits. 
Can send pictures if wanted.

Box has shelf wear but is sturdy and with no splits.

I would say that this copy has never been played.
The character pad is full and the dungeon master screen hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been folded yet.
An excellent addition to anyone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s collection.

Figures are generally in very good condition.  Barbarian sword shows some stress but not broken.  Couple of plastic appendage like elements (like a candlestick) show some stress but not broken.
Cardboard material in very good condition and all present.

Components look as if game was only played once.  Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pad had four used sheets, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s close to full.  Player shield, dice, board, instructions and quest book all show very very little wear.
Graded _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for two specific reasons.
One, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a split on the box top corner and some minor dishing to the box bottom.  Two, one of the monster pieces has a broken sword.  However, the two pieces look as if you can glue them together without too much trouble.

    <notes>MB Games/Games Workshop from 1989.
This pack includes Heroquest, together with three expansions - Kellar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Keep, Return of the Witch Lord and Wizards of Morcar. The expansions are unboxed and are in the original Heroquest box.
The box lid has a few small scuffs around the corners, but is otherwise very clean. The contents are in excellent condition - some have never been removed from their sprues.
All rules and quests are in English. This is a heavy package, so it may be too expensive to ship beyond EU.

Components are like new condition and unused. All the minis are perfect and no broken pieces same with the furniture candles intact etc and nothing painted, dice new, map etc. Cards crisp and straight as are the rules. Character Sheets are full and all the doors are straight and not bent which is highly unusual for this game, most inserts are unpunched and some of the tiles are still stuck together as well.  
Box is in great shape for its age (22 years!) and solid. Less than moderate shelf-wear overall and NO split corners.  Shows a little age with a few wrinkles. 
Can send pictures if wanted.
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice.

    <notes>THIS GAME INCLUDES AN EXPANSION. - KELLAR_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S KEEP.
the main game is complete and in very good condition.  the box has some whitening on the corners and edges, but is in good shape and has no split corners.
this game also comes with a copy of the kellar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s keep expansion inside.  
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/1762/heroquest-kellars-keep
the expansion does NOT have a box.  it is also missing two pieces.  one iron door (which is basically like a regular door, but used to mark special locations and is prettier) and a long cliff tile.  
as with most marketplace items, shipping is not included and can be quoted on request or when you purchase.</notes>

    <notes>A very nice copy overall, pieces were hand counted to verify 100% complete, every rat, every skull it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there. 
Components are in excellent or like new condition mostly; Board, rules, Questbook, minis all excellent and no broken swords etc on minis. Cards are crisp and straight and show only a little wear if any, some show a little age with slight discolouring. Two Rat tails missing half a tail (this is almost not worth mentioning and a tiny flaw). Some doors show they were bent before (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen this in every copy, very common). All other components are in excellent condition and overall components show very little flaws. 
Box is in good shape for its age and very solid with light wear, box has the following flaws; a few creases, one side has a bow in it, box top has one taped corner (clear hardly notice), one dent/ding on box bottom. Overall about moderate wear for age (22 years!) and solid with a few flaws. 
Can send pictures if wanted.

    <notes>Game materials are in very good condition.  Game cards and materials look to have never been played or played only once.  The player record sheets look to be nearly complete.  
All materials are accounted for and are generally in very good to like new condition.  Cards look virtually unplayed.  Miniatures are all in good shape with nothing broken.  The furniture has no broken bits and the skulls and rats are present.  Some of the doors are bent over from the way they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been stored (very typical, and easily bent back).  The game board also has a slight warp from being stored on top of the components (instead of under).  Should flatten with some play and now that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s stored under the components it should help.
The box is showing some edgewear and a little shelfwear.  One box corner is split but overall box integrity is good.
Shipping will be $12 to Eastern and Central US and $14 to Mountain and Pacific regions.  Other locations please inquire.

    <notes>Good. Heroquest + Kellers Keep + Return of the Witch Lord + Against the Ogre Horde + Adventure Design Kit. Components generally in a played but very good condition. A few figures are part painted. Missing one closed door (not the base, so other doors from the expansions can be easily used instead), but includes an extra Fimir! 1 Ogre needs his arm to be glued in place. Missing the boxes for the expansions (aside from the adventure design kit). A few of the adventure design kit stickers have been used, as well as one of the adventure booklet pages (which is an adventure designed by me a long time ago!) Box has one blown corner and some shelf wear.

    <notes>RESERVED FOR Joe Norris ONLY
This game is in good shape, box does show its age.
However, I am missing some pieces.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to have the goblin minis.  Not sure why.  Also missing a mummy. Also missing a couple of cardboard tokens, Including the staircase.
Some of the pieces have been painted by the person who I bought it from.  They look great.  The game game comes with an extra skeleton and I think an extra choas warrior.  Furniture is in good shape.  I have also included 4 pre-paintedminis in case you want to play with female 
adventurers.  
I think that is it.
I will charge a flat $15 to ship within the U.S., it is a big box.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve fallen on hard times (haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t we all?) and need some cash: both are my personal copies, that we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played for years.
Everything is combined in different boxes, and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to sort it all out. *One is 100% complete, the other is at least 99.9% complete, and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some light damage here and there, but on the other hand there are also a few extras (dice, heroes, some terrain etc.) All boxes have a fair amount of wear, and some minis have varying degress of paint.

******ON HOLD FOR HAZOR, DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE HAZOR PLEASE******
This is for a 100% complete, 100% unplayed and 98% or so UNPUNCHED copy of this Classic out of print game. All components were inspected and hand counted by myself.  
All cardboard components are unpunched and on sheets still, all miniatures and furniture that came on sprues are still on sprues. (A couple of each did come loose from sheet or sprue during storage last 22 years hence the 98% unpunched). No components are broken or damaged in any way, they are all in new condition including rat tails, candle sticks, doors, everything. Nothing shows its age or is discoloured. Original Ads are still in the box. Components are the best I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ever seen for sure. 
Box is in pretty good shape for its age (22 years!) and very solid with no splits. Box top shows mostly light wear on edges and corners, one corner has a little clear tape on it. Bottom shows its age a little more, still less than moderate wear overall, has a few creases and a little clear tape on one corner. 
Can send pictures of anything if wanted.
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice. </notes>

    <notes>A very nice copy of this 22 year old out of print classic, pieces were hand counted to verify it is 100% complete, every rat, every skull it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there and I went through everything in detail like always(below). 
Components are in very good to excellent condition overall. Minis and furniture are all excellent and nothing is painted or broken like swords etc (one mini has a tiny bit of clear glue you can barely see, rat tails and one candle tip missing which I see in almost every set). Some things like Dice and Cards show some wear from normal play, cards and tiles are all crisp and straight, they show slight discolouring from age.  The board is in great shape overall, it has a couple of small creases in the top film. The books are very crisp and straight and in excellent condition, the quest book has some erased pencil on the back page.   
Box is in good shape for its age and surprisingly very solid, it has been taped in many spots with clear tape (done well) and generally shows its age with some creases and some dishing on lid.  
Can send pictures of anything if wanted
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice. </notes>

A very nice copy of this 22 year old Out of Print Classic, pieces were hand counted to verify it is 100% complete, every rat, every skull it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there (and no broken rat tails this is rare!) and I went through everything in detail like always. 
Components are in like new condition as the game was played exactly one time. Minis and furniture all excellent nothing is painted or broken like swords etc the only actual flaw I could find was one candle tip missing (extremely common). Dice look like new, cards crisp clean and straight, Rulebook and Questbook look unused, doors are all straight another rarity! 
Box is in great shape and solid with no split corners or tape and shows mostly minor wear on corners and a couple of creases, note the bottom of box has a large bow in it.

Components are in fair to good condition overall, things like cards and dice show moderate wear with a few cards showing light mottling or slight elastic damage, some sides of dice had faded and were touched up to compensate. For the mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; furniture 4 of the mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are painted (only one decent others just black not so good), Elf has a broken sword, Orc is missing his weapon and rack is missing one handle otherwise all in good shape. Map has a slight warp and a few creases in top film, Quest book has slight stain along the top, information table has a slight bow and has been taped (clear) in a few spots. 
Box is solid and mostly only shows light wear for its age, it has 2 taped corners(clear done well), a few creases, and note has a water stain on the inside of top lid and box is bowed in some spots.

    <notes>Let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s start with the good:
- It is complete. There are actually over two full sets of minis (some are painted - see below). But there is a complete set of unpainted minis in the box.
- There are actually extras of most everything (it was two sets combined into one. So there is extra furniture, extra figures, extra dice, etc.).
- There is an incomplete copy of Kellar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Keep inside. It appears that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most (if not all) of the figures and the majority of the tiles are there. But there is a door or two missing and maybe some of the tiles. The most important things are there - the quest book and the cards.
And the bad:
- The box is pretty beat up. 2 splits on the box lid and 1 on the box bottom. Some shelf wear too as these big boxes always seem to accrue.
- Some industrious kid appears to try his hand at painting, so some of the miniatures are painted. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not the worst job I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ever seen, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not great either. All of the skeletons, mummies, and zombies are painted and some of the goblins. Anyway, not sure how you feel about that, but I thought I should mention it.
- and finally, the white dice are worn a bit. Whoever had this game before really must have played it a lot. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re still mainly legible, but they could be clearer.
Buyer pays actual shipping cost.

    <notes>This is an auction win for Ian Allen (glookose)
Here is a rundown on everything. 
I have all components inside of the regular HeroQuest and the Advanced HeroQuest boxes (so I do not have the actual boxes for the expansions, but have all components and miniatures).
HeroQuest (USA and UK) - One full set of components for USA game include all minis, components, cards tons of extra dice, etc. Also includes a set of UK Rules/Quest Book, UK cards (different from US) and a bunch of extra furniture items. All minis are mint/unbroken/not painted. Just like getting them new.
HeroQuest Advanced Quest - This set is essentially a regular set with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Advanced_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the box, it has a new quest book and a bunch of extra miniatures. All of the extra items are in with the main set (Note: I am missing a couple of man-at-arms with crossbows and halberds, but have extra men, need some of the weapons).
HeroQuest: Against the Ogre Horde - Mint/complete
HeroQuest: Elf Quest Pack - Mint/missing female elf mini, otherwise complete.
HeroQuest: Kellar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Keep - Mint/complete
HeroQuest: Return of the Witch Lord - Mint/complete
HeroQuest: Wizards of Morcar - Mint/complete
I have extra rule books and cards for the above as well, some of these sets were both available in UK and USA, so I have extra rules, cards and questbooks for some when I have ended up with both USA and UK versions.

A very nice copy of this 22 year old Out of Print Classic, pieces were hand counted to verify it is 100% complete, every rat, every skull it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there and I went through everything in detail. 
Components are in excellent to like new condition overall. Mapboard is like new, Minis and furniture are all excellent and nothing is painted or broken like swords etc, none of the doors are bent (this is rare!) and the only tiny flaws I could find were one candle tip and one rat tail being broken(extremely common). The books are very crisp and straight and are in like new condition, cards are in excellent condition note a couple show very slight small ripples on sides, dice show only a touch of wear, Evil Screen like new, Armory in excellent shape note though there is writing on the underside (bottom not used in game), and the character pad looks to be missing only 4 or 5 sheets showing it was likely played only once or maybe twice.  
Box is in great shape for its age and very solid, it shows normal shelf wear mostly overall for a box this old, both bottom and top were taped across each side with clear packing tape by prior owner, the sides of top have a slight bow in them and the underside has a stain in one corner.

    <notes>Box has a lot of wear, but is still basically sound. No split corners, though a couple are weak. Components are complete and in very good condition except that the gargoyle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s head is detached (but present - could be glued back on).  This is a one-owner game, not a thrift-store find or ebay purchase.

    <notes>This is the UK version of the game, however components differ slightly from the listing below (but they do match my own second copy of the game so I think that the listing is not entirely accurate). The game is definitely used, but the components are in acceptable condition.
Box is worn and has two corners split. Missing 2 skulls, 1 candlestick, the plastic base for the Fireplace and the cardboard bases for the Bench _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Table.
EXTRA: 8 Orcs, 6 Goblins _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 3 Fimir miniatures so you get double the amount for all of these.

    <notes>Game has all parts (pictures provided)
Dice are somewhat faded from prolific use (many years ago).  Cards are in good condition.  Figures are all in good condition, but one of the zombies was colored slightly.  (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure what my brother used to color him with... crayon perhaps?  I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to scratch off the job, whatever he used, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only 1 figure out of 35 plus the furniture.)  
52 unused character sheets are still on the pad.  Not sure how many sheets started on the pad.  18 used sheets are included (most of them used pencil).  There are 2 maps that were originally blank, but my brother penciled in two scenarios (1 on each, obviously.)  Since they were in pencil, if you really want, you could erase them, then photocopy the papers, if you really wanted to use that map sheet.
Box is slightly faded, but not terribly so.
There are some very minor stains/blemishes on the inside of the box, but those obviously won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect game play.
Shipping will be via USPS Priority Mail, probably with the use of the Large Flat Rate Box (Board game shape).  Cost is $17.45.
Outside of the US, ask for price (or go to USPS.com, and calculate shipping via Large Flat Rate Box).</notes>

    <notes>Minor box wear/damage (top left corner crimped, some splitting) -- most would call this item VG condition, and certainly I would be unashamed to give this as a present to someone who desired it and otherwise couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t obtain their own.  All components present (one orc damaged).  About half of the score sheets used.  All items/figures constructed; a number of the open doors are lightly bowed.
I would also trade this straight up for a copy of Dungeon Petz (or possibly Manhattan Project) if trader covers shipping on both.</notes>

Base game in very good condition. All components are punched, 100% complete, and look only lightly played - only a few character sheets have been used. Elf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sword shows some stress, but otherwise all components are in excellent shape. Very good condition overall. Box has a little shelfwear and one very small wrinkle on top.

Note: The Sorcer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Table appears to have its base missing. I spent ages going through my other copies without finding one. There is a thread in the BGG forums that confirms that the UK edition did not have one, although a bit of scanning and crafting would fix that!</notes>

    <notes>All main compoenents are there and in very good condition. According ot the compoenent list in the rulebook this is missing 1 empty door frame and 1 single blocked square token, but there are 2 extra pit trap tokens. 
The box lid has a split on one flap and shows some creaasing, but for a 1989 vintage game this is in pretty good condition.
e.
AS far as I can tell this is the first edition as it shows a 1989 copyright.</notes>

    <notes>The contents are in great shape, looks like it has been played once or twice.   A couple of the orcs have broken swords, looks like a clean break and they should be able to be glued.The rule and scenario books are in perfect shape, and so are the cards.  Game is complete.   The box is a little rough but sound, has shelf wear and a couple of surface tape marks.  This also includes the Witch Lord expansion, that looks like it is missing one skeleton and the revolving room tile.
Estimated shipping of $16.</notes>

No creases on the rule book and dungeon master shield.  Even an extra skull and rat for the mantel pieces.  Shipping will be based on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sent. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a rather large box. Shipping from CA. Small wear on the box corners. So for it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m calling it like new.</notes>

Box is in excellent shape with only very minor dings and slight shelf wear. Game bits are in unused condition, even the rat tails are all perfect. Some fragile pieces show minimal damage, including stressed Elf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sword, Gargoyle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wings, and missing flame on one candlestick - see detailed photo.  Game is free from offensive odors (smoke, pet, mildew, etc).</notes>

    <notes>I found this one at a local yard sale. As far as I can tell, this game has been put together, but never played - or, played quite infrequently .... and delicately. Great find!
The FANTASTIC:
 - Everything is included; Full contents have been personally checked
 - All pieces seem to be in perfect condition; swords are pointy, no noticeable bends or breaks.
 - Cardboard shows no wear or bends
 - Includes original dice!
 - There are no creases in the Quest book, DM_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s guide, or the DM shield
 - No noticeable wear on the cards
 - The game advert is included
 - No character sheets have been used (top page is not indented)
 - Game board has no peelings, skuffs, or dings
The Not-so-Perfect:
 - The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original box is only in decent shape - it is still quite intact and structurally functional (it will store on a shelf just fine), but the paper is peeling, especially on the corners. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included photos so you can see specifically how worn it is, if those things are important to you. There are games with worse boxes than this in my collection...
Honestly, check out the photos for the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fantastic overall condition. Aside from the box, this is as close to perfect as you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get from a 20+ year old game... I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to grade it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Shipping: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send it anywhere in the US and add only my cost of shipping; Depends on where you live in relation to me- Estimated at ~$20.00.</notes>
