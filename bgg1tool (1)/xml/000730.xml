   <description>Breakout: Normandy is a complex two-player wargame on the Allied invasion of France in World War 2.  The game concentrates on the initial landings and the subsequent breakout attempts.  The German player tries to prevent the a successful Allied landing, and if that fails, to contain the beachhead.  The Allied player wins by establishing a beachhead, or (better) by successfully breaking out of the landing area._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The mapboard depicts the Normandy area where the initial landings took place.  Units are regiments and brigades, representing infantry, airborne, armour artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Turning Point: Stalingrad._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The previous owner had taped the board (by the corners only) to the table at one time.  You can barely see the tape on the playing surface.  Everything else is in near-mint condition.

    <notes>The game is in NEW condition, in original factory shrink wrap.
Payment is expected to arrive and clear before games will ship. Pay Pal is preferred.  I will ship USPS Priority Mail unless otherwise agreed upon.  Shipping charges are those quoted by the USPS for shipping the item (http://www.usps.com/prices/priority-mail-prices.htm).  Insurance is optional, but I am not liable for non-insured packages once shipped.  If multiple items are bought I will combine items (if practical) to save the buyer shipping costs.  I must be contacted within 5 days of package receipt for refund.  Item(s) is to be returned in the same condition that it was sold in and the buyer is responsible for shipping the item(s) back.  
Enjoy.

Additional pictures furnished upon request.
 
Best wishes,
Jon

    <notes>Collectable quality sample that is less expensive than Mint and is generally in Mint minus quality, especially for the unplayed components.  This is a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game that plays with nail-biting tension.  I simply prefer lower unit games like squad or unit level games.  Excellent condition, super clean Very Good - more of a Like New minus for the components.  Gorgeous cover condition - one of my favorite of all box art.  Box structure intact.  Box back cover has light shelf wear - closer to Very Good to Excellent condition.  Counters unpunched and pristine.  Map boards are pristine.  Instruction book has been opened but is in perfect condition.  High quality shipping packing is ensured.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like shipping excuses when I buy games for myself.  CONUS only.  Paypal welcome.  $95 plus $15 shipping. Considerate BGG user price for this condition.

    <notes>Avalon Hill version. Numerous articles, strategy guides and errata pages printed out and included. Complete, unpunched and in great shape. Very little shelf wear. Smoke free household.
Combined shipping available on multiple purchases so check out my other items for sale.
I ship via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation in most cases. Larger games or trades will likely ship via FedEx. I only charge you what it costs me to ship the game and I will try to ship without flat rate shipping where weight and distance would result in a lower price. For international shipping there may be some restrictions on where I will ship to. Please contact me before purchasing. </notes>

    <notes>I can ship to the United States and international locations outside the EU using the USPS Priority Mail.  For games going to the U.S. the postal rate is the same as mailing within the 50 states, I am stationed in Germany, hence the item location; to estimate postage use 09112 for an area code.  For other countries international postal rates will apply.  For all EU countries I can mail using the German Postal System DHL to mail to your EU country, my German area code is 92256.  
The game is mostly punched, has never been played, is complete and in excellent condition.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete, with one German counter replaced with a home-made counter (see pictures).  Counters are punched (not clipped) and organized in the counter tray.  First page of rulebook has slight warping due to a probability chart being glued to the front cover.  Return address sticker of former owner on top right of rulebook, and there are some notes written in black ink in the rule book.  Mounted mapboard is in excellent shape.  Box has nicks and scuffs but remains structurally sound with no blown corners.
I will ship worldwide; buyer pays all shipping charges.  US orders will be shipped via USPS priority mail flat-rate shipping for actual costs.</notes>

    <notes>Game is not in cellophane, but it is in otherwise brand new condition, never punched, never played
Game has been handled with  TLC.  My late husband was an avid boardgamer, and like to play almost as much as he liked to collect them.  He took excellent care of all of his games.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play them all, but if he did play them, no food or drink was allowed near the game.  All games have been stored in a pet free, non smoking environment.  Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask if there are any questions.  Thank you!</notes>

The lid is slightly bowed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; has small tear at corner and center of the bottom, but nothing major (it was bought that way)- so the listing for the box would be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but the contents are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  (please see photo). The map has a slight crease in a small section, nothing major (it arrived that way too). Kept in a pet free/smoke free home.</notes>
