   <description>In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago. They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence. Then everyone will lose!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;According to the author, what he's tried to create is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;German_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; economic worker-placement game, but without the two things he dislikes in them: the superficial theme and the lack of interaction. Indeed this game includes a very present theme and a lot of negotiation and potential backstabbing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game includes three sets of objectives, enabling players to choose between a short, medium and a long game. Solo play is also possible with an expansion._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;IN FRENCH_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Archipelago retrace l_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;egrave;re majestueuse de la d_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;couverte des archipels _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;agrave; travers le globe de 1492 (d_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;couverte des Antilles par Christophe Colomb) jusqu_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;agrave; 1797 (colonisation de Tahiti)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Chaque joueur incarne un explorateur et son _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;quipe, mandat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;s par une nation europ_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;enne pour d_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;couvrir, coloniser et exploiter les archipels.

    <notes>Includes Archipelago: the Solo Expansion
Everything is in great shape. Cards for base game and expansion have been sleeved with premium sleeves. This copy has been played 3 times.
NOTE: I am red-green colorblind, and have marked the cubes symbolizing the wood resource so I can tell them from the others. The marking consists of a black dot on each face of each cube. I have also marked the player screens and base game cards wherever there is a picture of that type of cube so that they match the actual cubes as I have marked them.
This item comes from a smoke-free, pet-free, adult-only home and has been meticulously cared for. I am liquidating my collection before going on a long journey.
I ship promptly and pack with loving care to ensure the game reaches you in the same condition it was when shipped. Shipping quote upon request. Combined shipping available, please browse my inventory! Local pickup available in Portland, Oregon.
Serious inquiries only, please.</notes>

Discover the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s archipelagos! Each player takes on the role of an explorer and their team, mandated by a European nation to discover, colonize and profit from the archipelagos. These missions are supposed to happen diplomatically, by answering the needs of the local population as much as the regular demands from the continent. Archipelago combines exploration, resource management, optimization, cooperation, strategy, negotiation, corruption, commerce, suspicion, alliances and betrayals, even a hint of investigation! </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMARCH01US)
 Discover the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s archipelagos! Each player takes on the role of an explorer and their team, mandated by a European nation to discover, colonize and profit from the archipelagos. These missions are supposed to happen diplomatically, by answering the needs of the local population as much as the regular demands from the continent. Archipelago combines exploration, resource management, optimization, cooperation, strategy, negotiation, corruption, commerce, suspicion, alliances and betrayals, even a hint of investigation! </notes>

    <notes>In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago. They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) – all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them.
But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence. Then everyone will lose!
According to the author, what he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tried to create is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;German_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; economic worker-placement game, but without the two things he dislikes in them: the superficial theme and the lack of interaction. Indeed this game includes a very present theme and a lot of negotiation and potential backstabbing.
The game includes three sets of objectives, enabling players to choose between a short, medium and long game; a solo option will also be included.

    <notes>Game played only twice, so everything is in excellent condition!  This game does NOT fit well in the box with the original inserts, so we cut one of the inserts to make it easier to get the tiles in which is why I am listing it as Very Good, but honestly it is like new.  Pictures available on request.

It is in the same great condition.  Both the base game box and card box for the solo expansion are excellent.  Lastly, you will get the War _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Peace expansion as well which is New having only the shrink removed from the box.  The cards are still in wrap and the box for this expansion is excellent as well.</notes>

    <notes>1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>

    <notes>Includes War and Peace expansion.
Great condition, but please note the following:  This was originally the French edition of the game, the game manual and the few of the cards with text are in French.  It was sent to me by a slightly unscrupulous seller.  However I realised that it was easy enough to remedy by printing off copies of the english manual and, slightly more involved, printing high quality English language versions of the cards with text and placing the print outs over the French versions and using sleeves to make it so that they look perfect.  The result is a perfect, sleeved, English language version of the game!  The expansion is just the English version, added to the main box.
I appreciate this is a little unorthadox, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve reduced the price slightly to entice.

    <notes>This copy of Archipelago is unplayed and in perfect condition EXCEPT that due to a printing error punchboard 9 has the backside of punchboard 7 on it and vice versa. I also think that the backside of punchboard 8 is printed upside-down, but that punchboard is set up so that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the same when you rotate it 180º, so everything looks normal. I asked for replacement boards back in 2012 or 2013 when I got the game, but I never received them, then I just forgot about it and now the game is wildly out of print, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never get them.
You can probably make photocopies of the backsides of the punchboard, then glue them on to play. Me, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m okay just moving this game on to someone else and letting them worry about the craft project needed to make the game playable.</notes>

Postage costs will vary depending on your location. In the U.K. I normally use MyHermes as they can collect from my location - not all of the couriers do.
The cost of shipping within the U.K. is normally between £5-£10 depending on the weight of the game - most of the regular sized (square box) games I am selling tend to be in the 2-5kg category.
I always ship with tracking information and enough insurance to cover the cost of the game.

    <notes>After owning this for nearly six years, I finally opened it up and played with my wife last weekend for the first time. As a 2-player game this kind of fell flat for us, as the game supposedly shines more when there are more players and they negotiate. With just the two of us it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t as fun as it could be. Since we mostly play 2-player games nowadays, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve decided to part with Archipelago. 
This is in excellent condition, only played once.</notes>

    <notes>FREE SHIPPING! Game is in GREAT condition  - only reason it is listed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is it is missing a single black _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;iron_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cube which could be easily replaced: game is still playable and otherwise it is in great condition. All other pieces present and organized.</notes>
