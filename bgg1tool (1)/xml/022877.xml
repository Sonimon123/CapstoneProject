The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements.

    <notes>Complete and in top-notch condition. Counters are 95% punched, clipped, sorted, and bagged. Mission pad still mostly complete. Box is pristine. The only component to show any wear is the action deck, which shows a little usage. Vietnam deck is still in the shrink. Does not yet include the errata counters, although they may be obtained for free direct from GMT.
Shipping weight is 3lb 1oz, so shipping in the US will most likely be $10.35 for flat-rate shipping, although if you are close to CA regular Priority Mail may be cheaper.</notes>

There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single playing is a mission and several missions from an historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 - 2 hours. 
This game is based on three actual campaigns experienced by units of the 9th US Infantry in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Up the Fire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is the motto of the 9th Infantry, known as the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Manchus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for their service in the Boxer Rebellion.

Fields of Fire is a solitaire game of commanding a rifle company between World War II and Present Day. The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based. There are two decks used to play. The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform. The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts. The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters. A single playing is a mission and several missions from an historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements. A mission can be played in about 1 - 2 hours.

[Note I will sell to a buyer in Canada, but this game is really heavy and shipping would likely be prohibitive.]

    <notes>New/sealed item! Fast shipping! Pay via paypal to maydaygames@gmail.com or save 2% by paying to existingfunds@sphiatt.com instead with existing paypal funds.
Buyer to pay just $9.95 shipping!
Yes we can combine shipping on multiple items! Save even more!
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com or save 2% by sending payments to existingfunds@sphiatt.com instead. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Yes we can combine orders at significant shipping discounts.
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Combined shipping works as follows for domestic (48 lower states) orders:
Highest price shipping item: Full shipping cost
2nd-4th highest priced items: 50% off shipping cost for each of these items.
5th-10th highest priced shipping items: 60% off shipping costs for each of these items.
11th+ highest priced shipping items: 75% off shipping for all the rest of the items.
As an example say you purchased 15 games, 3 of them with $10 shipping, 5 of them with $8 shipping and 7 of them with $4 shipping. The total shipping for the 15 items would be:
Full shipping on the first item: $10.00
50% off shipping on items 2-4: $14.00 (50% off $10, $10 and $8, the next highest shipping cost items)
60% off shipping on items 5-10: $14.40 (60% off of 3 items at $8 shipping and 3 more items at $4 shipping = $36)
75% off shipping on items 11-15: $4.00 (75% off 4 items at $4)
Total shipping on these 15 items then would be $10+$14+$14.40 + $4 = $42.40 shipping. This is just an example and your results will vary depending on what you buy of course!</notes>

    <notes>All of the game components (cards, counters, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game 4 times. I will include the score sheet I produced and my revised player mat. The punched counters have been carefully separated, trimmed, sorted and bagged. Some of the counters are unpunched and the official replacement counters have been incorporated. The player aids have five very small, neat handwritten notes added but these help with play anyway.
I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.

    <notes>Game is complete, with counters clipped and neatly organized in a small toolbox that perfectly fits in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box. The game is otherwise in pristine condition, with the cards in their original shrinkwrap. The rulebooks have no wear at all. 
The replacement counters that were issued by GMT in C3i magazine are also included. 
The game has no shelf wear either and has been sitting in a closed cabinet in my home, under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. At this price and in these conditions, this game is a bargain.
I will ship worldwide at buyer’s expenses. Shipping to Europe is 13 Euros; within Italy 9 Euros , and 13 Euros to the rest of the world. .
Paypal preferred. Feel free to email me with questions!
(IMPORTANT NOTICE: I am away from home on most weekdays, so allow a couple of days for a reply to your queries). 
Thanks for looking! Riccardo

    <notes>First Edition, played 4 times. Half of the counters are already clipped, and everything is sorted in 2 GMT trays.
The cards are in excellent condition, as well as most of the counters. However, a handful of the counters seemed to have stuck to one another and caused the ink to fade somewhat, but this won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hinder gameplay (See attached photo). The majority of counters are in excellent condition.
Shipping worldwide is $25.
Shipping within Japan is $12.</notes>

I will provide tracking information for your item and insurance sufficient to cover the final price of the auction on shipped items.
Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.
If you have any special requests, please Geekmail me so we can discuss prior to payment finalization.
Thank you for your purchase and I hope you enjoy your new game(s)!</notes>
