   <description>Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe and is based loosely on the popular SQUAD LEADER game system. Players need not be familiar with any of the various SQUAD LEADER games or rules to play. The basic theory behind the design remains the same; only the mechanics of play differ. UP FRONT is a far simpler adaptation of SQUAD LEADER principles designed to a card game format. Yet, in many ways, the game is more realistic than its predecessor in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;hexagons_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UP FRONT is a game player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, its famous predecessor, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s an unbeatable combination._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each game includes: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     162 full-colour, quality 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;frac14;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times; 3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;frac12;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; playing cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     120 full-colour 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times; 2.6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; infantry cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     40 full-colour 2.3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times; 3.1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; AFV cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     304 double-faced .75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, .6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, and .5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A plastic card tray_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Notes, Historical T, O _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; E charts and Campaign Game Rosters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never played this game, and so it is difficult to assess, and the instruction manual does not help much.  The box is in great shape.  As for the components: of the 160 playing cards, all are in good shape except two were slightly stuck together.  As a result, one has a mark on the back, so you would be able to see that when it was facedown.  The other one has a mark, but not over any text and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not visible from the back.  Another card has a very minor crease at the corner.  The box says there should be 304 counters.  I counted 304, but three were blank.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if that means that three are missing or that there were 304 counters, including the three blank ones.Otherwise, everything else looks perfect.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve marked it down because of the above.</notes>

    <notes>Box is in great shape with clear graphics and very minimal shelf wear.  All counters and cards have been checked against original components, and are all accounted for and in great shape!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sorted all of the chits into a compartmented plastic container to keep them all organized and easy to find.
Overall, this copy looks like it was only played once or twice.  I bought it for the purposes of playing, but just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t feel like digesting the rules!
I hope this finds a good home where it can be played and enjoyed!</notes>

    <notes>This is the complete second edition of the game. I have verified that every counter and card is present. (Well, there were a small number of unused two-color counters. Those I discarded long ago.)
I am the original owner of the game, and have played it (I think) twice. In general, the game is in good condition. I’ll describe the wear, below.
I’ll start with the most obvious flaw — The box has two big (about 1 1/2 inch) rips in the middle of the front. (At a guess, something too heavy was put on it at some point.) Otherwise the box is in very good condition, with a little shelf wear on one corner.
(Be sure to the listed links if you would like to see the parts — especially for the parts with flaws.  But beware that some of these are very big files.)

The box bottom is in good to very good condition, with dirt and shelf wear on the corners.  I’ve pictured the dirtier parts, below, as well as the whole box bottom.

I didn’t clip hanging bits of cardboard, so there is the usual (for AH games) cardboard bits on the edges. That goes (to a lesser extent) for the soldier and vehicle cards, too, since they were likewise removed from a cut sheet.
As to the individual counters — The lower right corner of the Russian demolition charge has about 4mm of the surface paper raised up. A few of the morale counters have slight marring on the top or bottom edge of the counter. One “morale 0” counter has a 1/2 cm light stain. The second picture below shows the marred counters in detail.
http://students.washington.edu/ldubb/games/auctionPictures/Pictures/Counters/UpFrontAllCounters.JPG
http://students.washington.edu/ldubb/games/auctionPictures/Pictures/Counters/UpFrontMarredCounters.JPG
The soldier, vehicle, and reference cards are generally clean and unmarred with good edges, but there some (about 15) with light mars. All the German soldier cards are printed about 1mm to the right, as is shown in the picture, below. (All information is visible, and there’s still a margin on the right; They’re just not exactly centered.)
http://students.washington.edu/ldubb/games/auctionPictures/Pictures/UpFrontSoldierCards.JPG
All 162 playing cards are present. There are three cards with notable mars on their backs — These are all pictured, below. (The other cards are all in very good condition, without mars.)

The fronts are likewise clean and unmarred except as shown.  (Make sure to look at the minefield card, which is the worst of the bunch.)

There are a few 1 cm tears to the base of the card holder. It still works fine as a card holder. (You can see the card holder in the picture above with the box bottom.)
The rulebook has very slight wear on the outer edge of the pages an on its lower right corner. It is unbent and otherwise clean.

I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. This game will ship USPS priority mail, flat rate box. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.
Shipping cost is $10.00</notes>

    <notes>Many of the counters are unpunched. Cards are used but no creases or other damage.  Verified complete. Box corners are sound.  Some dings and shelfwear.  Rules show some aging and cover corner is a bit creased.  Otherwise, no highlighting or underlining. Some of the troop cards have values lightly penciled in.  Get it before the rumored 2015 reprint!   See the picture.   If you have additional questions on game condition, please ask!  </notes>

    <notes>Up Front (1983) from Avalon Hill
Box: Light shelf-wear and a few very minor dings. Two of the corners on the front and one corner of the back have some wrinkling, and the paper is slightly bubbled on the left side of the front (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about 1/2 wide and runs from the top to about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from the bottom). Overall, the box is in Very Good+ condition!
Contents: New, unplayed, unpunched, and in Mint Condition! The 162 action card deck, 120 infantry cards (which have been expertly separated from their perforations, 40 vehicle cards (still in their original condition and need to be sparated) and the rule book are all in mint condition! The two sheets of counters are unpunched and in mint condition! The card tray is also in mint condition! This is a superb copy of this awesome game! All of the cards are stored in plastic bags for safety and convenience.

    <notes>The 2nd edition of Up Front. Which was the last edition.
This is a never used board game. I bought this in the mid 90_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s during a phase when I was buying lots of games. Never got around to playing this one. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in new condition and the outside of the box is perfect. You will have no complaints. All I did was remove the shrink wrap to look at the game then packed it away and never played it. 
Will provide pics as proof of pristine condition if requested</notes>

Foreign buyers should contact me if interested. Sending boxes out of the U.S. has gotten very expensive. If you have concerns about condition e-mail me and I can send pix.</notes>

    <notes>The original Avalon Hill classic.
This is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of the game and is well used.
It is complete and comes with an extra set of cards and extra character cards for all the main nationalities.
These were ordered to replace worn cards, but all included within box.
Box is complete, although written on inside lid.
Also has 2 sets of rules, both worn and marked.
Includes a handmade set of Italian forces.
A good, heavy bundle of Up Front gaming.
Would prefer to keep sale within the U.K. as box now quite heavy. 
Will do Europe, but postage could be chunky.</notes>

    <notes>Second edition.  It has been played only a few times, and only using the German and American cards and counters and only for the first scenario.  The box looks sharp and is strong - no broken corners, and no creases in the top or bottom.  However, there is a rough spot along the box top (I have no idea what it is from), and the box bottom has some looseness in the paper, though it looks sharp and clear.  The rules book is crisp and clean, showing that it was read many years ago but otherwise very good.  The Action Cards, the heart and soul of the game, look brand new.  The Personality cards are mostly in pristine condition, though a few have small marks from rubber bands, and one card has a rough spot from taking it from the card sheet. Mostly, this is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; game, with a few minor blemishes.</notes>

    <notes>This is the basic game with Russian, German and Americans. The rules are not complete and the game is in a plain Avalon Hill Bookcase box.  I bought this just as UP was going out of print in the late 90s. Counters are in excellent condition; cards show signs of wear, but are complete and serviceable. Troop counters are complete as well. If you have a complete rules set and the original box, this set will make great backup parts.  </notes>

AH Second edition.
Condition Notes:
Smoke-free home.  
Unpunched (although a handful of counters have become detached and have been secured in a baggie).  I have never played it, but got it in a trade (looks like it has never been played by anybody).  The cards have been separated (they may have come that way from the publisher).  Box shows some shelfwear and a bit of scuffing, but it is in excellent shape for a game this old.  Otherwise average condition.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).
A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really accept Paypal payments any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played but in great shape. The box shows wear, it is from 1983! See pic. Inventory showed 160 cards, I saw somewhere there is 162? I do not think I lost any, maybe they were logo cards or something..not sure just want to be honest here. If you want pics of the contents I will more than happy to shoot a few and send them to you . Buyer pays for shipping. Thanks. I will ship world wide just may need some help in doing so!!

    <notes>This is for the Second Edition Up Front Rulebook Only.  No other components are included.  The rulebook is the latest Second Edition printing and was never used or read.  It is extremely crisp for its age with only a very minor amount of ripple on the upper right corner (nowhere even near a crease in severity, total about 4 pages for this ripple) and Im sure any Up Front fan would be otherwise thrilled at its overall condition.  Price includes shipping. Check my other listings as well.</notes>

    <notes>This is a PREORDER. It includes FREE SHIPPING (in the US).
This is for a copy of everything from the PVT level in the recent Kickstarter project. That includes:
-The base game of Up Front (US vs. Germany)
-The Up Front cloth patch
-Norway
-FFI, Army of Africa, French Liberation Army, Vichy French
-Canada
-Australia
-Tito_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Partisans
-Finland
-Greece and Free Greeks
-Hungary
-Airborne Pack

-SS
-USMC
-Italian Folgore
-Third set of tokens
-Alternate Cower Replacement Cards
-Gurkhas

-Alternate Weapons
-Devil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brigade
-Mountain Action Deck

According to estimates, this should be at least 1,500 cards. It could have a retail value of over $300.
This will be shipped to you as soon as the game comes out. The earliest that is likely to happen would be November 2013. Beware that the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s publishers are currently facing a lawsuit that may delay and or cancel the release of this game. If it is cancelled, I will refund your purchase.
Again, shipping in the US is free. However, expect international shipping to be very expensive. (Ignore the notes about shipping below. They are automatically attached to all of my items for sale.)</notes>

    <notes>This game shows it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age (the cards and rulebook have some some yellowing from age), but the cards have very little actual wear from play. It was played a couple of times in the mid 90s and has been sitting in a plastic storage bin since then. 
There is a 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; triangular fold in the lower right corner of approximately the last 10 pages of the rulebook where it looks like something heavy was placed while the pages were bent.  
I have manually counted all the components (304 chits not to mention cards !) to make sure you are getting a complete game.

    <notes>Artscow prints of the redesign cards (not original card art). Cards only, not counters.
Original: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/211884/up-front?size=medium
Redesign: http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1008224_t.jpg
Another point to make, is that I decided to go with a standard back design on the cards, so all the card-backs look like this: http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1008227_t.jpg
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen some other designs that use different back images for different nations and different types of cards, but mine are all the same/standard.
Full discussion on the redesign can be found here if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like more info: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458796/up-front-redesign/pag...
For some reason I have extra cards. For example, in the original up front there were, apparently, 41 American cards, but I have 44. All are clearly numbered from 1-44, so I suspect the extra 3 may be from expansions (I know the Banzai expansion included several extra American_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, so this may be it). But there are also extra Russians and Germans, so I suspect the extras may have come from promos over the years that were included in the redesign. As a result, I have 7 decks of 54 cards. This includes the complete Action deck, the Personality cards, plus some extra blanks that I printed off [just in case I later lost or damage a card]. 
They are in excellent condition, and have pretty much remained in their cases (plastic artscow containers) unplayed. The quality of the printing is also excellent, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be happy to take some photos if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to check.
There should be A (1-5), A (6-10, B(1-5), B (6-10). But instead of this I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed 2x A (1-5), 2x B (1-5), etc.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and in excellent condition - the game has been played with (but I look after my games very carefully) and the counters are therefore punched, but none show any wear and the cards show no _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;wear and tear_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. There is a very slight _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;foxing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; crease to the top of the box lid but the box itself is sound and shows little shelf wear for a game that is 30 years old.
From a smoke and pet-free home and will be carefully packed.

    <notes>I had a hard time listing the condition on this one. It is complete  and It has never been played, and some of the counters and cards are still unpunched, but it does have a fair amount of box wear and the rulebook has one detached page and some red stains on the inside cover. I have attached photos of the components. Feel free to email with questions or offers. 
Make me an offer!
I will only accept paypal unless you live in Denver and want to pay cash (BGG will still get 3%).

The cover page (only) of the rules have been separated at the staple, and the box has MINOR scuffing. Everything flat, with no folding.  Basically looks like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never even been read ( I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t)
Great beautiful copy!  Pictures available on request of this little gem of a game.

    <notes>Well preserved, neatly stored, all the playing cards are in card protectors, all other pieces are stored in appropriate zip loc baggies
My late husband was an avid board gamer, if his game had been played, he made sure there was no food or drink around his games.  He stored them neatly and usually well organized.  He loved collecting games almost as much as he loved playing them.  I am looking to make sure they go to good homes where they will be will taken care of.   Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>This is the 2nd Ed that cost about $50 from Wargame Vault. I made counters by pasting the images on scrabble pieces. I put the counters and cards into white box with a lid that closes magnetically. I have only played the game once so the cards are in perfect condition. I will ship it anywhere in the US for $10, so you get the Wargame Vault package, with homemade scrabble counters, and nice box to keep it all in for $10 dollars less than if you order the game from Wargame Vault.</notes>

    <notes>Very nice condition. The counters are nearly all unpunched. The only ones bagged appear to have fallen from the sprues. Cards, deck tray and rules are in very fine condition. It looks rarely if ever played.
The box has some shelf wear - creasing and scuffed corners. But the contents are A1.
I will ship worldwide, but it is quite a heavy box so non-uk shipping will likely be very expensive.</notes>

    <notes>THIS IS NOT THE AVALON HILL VERSION! This is a fan reprint I printed via artscow.
Discussed here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1289598/go-here-final-instructions-order-and-create-unoffi/page/1
and here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/458796/front-redesign
Important: The borders of the action cards aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t centered super well (see pics). In practice the differences are random enough that they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t give anything away, but they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t perfect.
Includes all available decks and variants: base game, Banzai, Desert War, Finnish, Greek, Romanians, and counter replacement cards/action deck alternate cards. Also includes a complete set of double thickness counters, handmade by yours truly. All cards are sleeved in penny sleeves. Includes B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;W revised fan rulebook in binder. Ships in Resident Evil card game box.</notes>

    <notes>RESERVED FOR:  Paul Shabatowski
Price is in CAD. This is the original Avalon Hill 1983 edition with expansions. Has the original manuals and even the small advertising cards, mail order catalogs etc. Cards are sleeved. Counters are punched. Original box shows mild wearing and one discretely repaired corner split. Also comes with two expansions:
-Banzai (I also have the original banzai game box and original manuals as well): 
-Desert War
EDIT:  One card, soviet AFV #42 is missing.  Cards are otherwise complete.  This really shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay much as it would be easy to print out, and the vast majority of scenarios won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it.   I can print out a proxy and include it in the box if you like.</notes>

    <notes>The components are unpunched. Two of the decks of cards are shrink wrapped. One of the decks of cards are unwrapped, and I immediately sleeved them using fantasy flight sleeves. The box has shelf wear.
This game comes with enough fantasy flight sleeves to sleeve the entire game.
I am more than happy to send pictures upon request.</notes>

    <notes>Mostly unpunched. What is punched is very neatly trimmed. Sorted in bags, played, complete.  Includes the following from a print-on-demand service (DriveThruRPG):
Extra set of Action cards (poker size--unopened)
Banzai unit cards (poker size--unopened)  
Color scan of the Banzai countersheet (Last image above [note that this IS a scan!]--unopened)
Small format Banzai soldier cards (unopened)
Small format Banzai weapon cards (unopened)
Box has wear consistent with its age, but all corners intact.</notes>

    <notes>INCLUDES: BANZAI
All counters and cards accounted for and are in great shape (I never got around to play it and it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear that much of the set has been played by anyone - lots of counters still in original punch sheet)
Both boxes are faded with age and have lots of edge shelf wear.
Shipping (USPS Priority): $10
I will ship within a day of receiving payment.</notes>

    <notes>This copy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box is worn, but the components are basically untouched.  When I bought it a few years ago, the cards were still in the shrink, and I immediately sleeved them.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it 7 or 8 times, always in sleeves.  Even the mini-cards for the individual soldiers are in sleeves.  Some vehicles are not in sleeves, but they have never been used and are in a plastic bag.
All components other than the cards are unused.  I never punched the counters, instead using the BGG community-made replacement counters (see pic - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send you those in a bag too if you want them).
The manual is in like new shape. 
Great game; I just rarely got it to the table with my friends.  Basically, if you can handle the worn box, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re going to be getting like new components.</notes>
