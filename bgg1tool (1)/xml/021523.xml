   <description>Runebound is a classic adventure game from Fantasy Flight Games in which mighty heroes must take on the perils of Terrinoth. The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA05)
Runebound: A Fantasy Board Game of Heroes, Quests and Monsters
The marketplaces are quiet; the streets deserted. The rumors in the taverns and the whispers in the inns all suggest the same – the evil necromancer Vorakesh is raising undead legions to help him bring back Margath, the High Lord of All Dragonkind. If the realm has ever needed heroes, this is the time! 
In Runebound, up to six players can adventure in a fantasy realm full of danger and peril. Travel down raging rivers, explore dark and mysterious forests, and fight all manner of heinous beasts intent on stopping you from your goal – destroying the great dragon Margath before he destroys the land! 
Runebound Second Edition, the new standard in adventure board games, is all you liked about the original best-selling game and more. A complete revision of the original, Runebound Second Edition has an updated game board, revised rules, new and more challenging monsters, and twelve plastic figures to represent the stalwart heroes of the realm. This epic game of high fantasy is now better than ever!
Runebound is a fantasy adventure board game for 2-6 players.

    <notes>English version. Includes several expansions: Island of Dread, Battlemage character deck, The Scepter of Kyros variant, Crown of the Elder Kings variant, one of the artifact expansions and a couple of the challenge card expansions. Played several times but still in great shape. Only the box has damage - taped corners and some wear because it is stuffed full of goodies. Twelve of the figures are painted (quite nicely I might add). Ask for estimate on shipping before buying.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a HUGE lot of Runebound (2nd edition) games + expansions (14 total), including the second edition base game, 2 large expansions (Island of Dread _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Midnight, neither of which I have played except to add the base cards to the main game, thus some decks are still in their wrappers...I went Runebound crazy in 2007 and played about a dozen times, but sadly, my group decided they didnt want to play much anymore--ANY games--due to various life events, ie, growing up I guess!), all 6 character expansion decks, and 6 other expansion decks/variants (ie, Relics, Sceptre of Kryos, and 4 others).
All in all, I dropped over $300 easily on everything. I even spent hours designing updates to the game, making it more streamlined and easy to play (and logical in some ways--there was some quirkiness and clunky-ness to the game that we corrected and updated, at least to us :). I thought I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d throw this out there on BGG and see if anyone had an interest in buying ALL of what I listed above in 1 fell swoop. I know that in some places, the 2 expansions are going for close to $100 each. For $200, you can have it all, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll even throw in the shipping fees, which is easily another $25+ for the 3 large (and HEAVY) boxes. This is a steal if you add it all up! Thanks for considering, and happy new year!
Shipping--INCLUDED for the asking price of $200, or else $25 added on if price reduced.
Payment--Paypal only.
PS--BGG is not allowing me to post pics, but i have a good dozen or so avail if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to see them in detail. I tried posting the best 4, but BGG isnt taking them =/</notes>

    <notes>Includes 2nd Edition Base Game
Sand of Al Kalim
Frozen Wastes
Mists of Zanaga
Avatars of Kelnov
Cult of the Rune
Seven Scions
These were received in a trade a while back. All components stored in a dominion and quarriors expansion box. When I got it, the boards and rules smelled like smoke. I have since used dryer sheets that seems to have gotten rid of the smell. Components and cards are in very good condition overall, though a couple cards from one of the small box expansions (forgot which one, has a female angel looking picture on card back) has a large crease.
Also, some components were missing, they are two hero figures (Corbin and Astarra), one lost city token from Sand of Al Kalim, 8 rumor tokens from Frozen Wastes, one survival gear token from Frozen Wastes, several frost white/death counters from frozen wastes and one undefeated challenge marker. All of these can have stand ins used. Boards, components and cards in general look like they have never been played.
Also comes with a nice plano case that organize the chits very nicely. </notes>

This game is out of print and has been for awhile. There are no announcements for it to be reprinted. There is no stock of it anywhere to my knowledge.
This set at retail when available from coolstuffinc.com would have cost you about $114. Out of print prices for this set run about $500+ off amazon.com 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling all this together for $100.00 + shipping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; insurance which I estimate will be @ $20-30 UPS.

Contents:
* Runebound: Battlemage Character Deck
* Runebound: Runemaster Character Deck
* Runebound: Wildlander Character Deck
* Runebound: Shadow Walker Character Deck
* Runebound: Spiritbound Character Deck
(Note: Runebound 2nd Edition base game not included; listing here for convenience.)
Condition:
* All boxes, cards, and menace counters included and in good shape. Some normal wear present (flaps on backs of boxes show, for example).
* Extra green adventure counters are unfortunately not included - I gave away my second copy of Runebound a while back and those extra tokens were accidentally included.
* I only have one (1) character deck expansion rulebook available, so would prefer to sell as a set.</notes>

I prefer to ship to the US, but will ship to Canada as buyer pays all fees.  It will fit in a flat-rate box, so shipping should be somewhere around 11 bucks.  Feel free to message with any and all questions!  Paypal only please. Will combine shipping.</notes>

As a bonus, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including the Runebound: Shadows of Margath (Second Edition) 30 card expansion. (which I think is a must have expansion anyway!)
I also have many more of the expansion packs for sale too.

    <notes>This is for a Card Expansion lot.
The Expansions in this lot are:
Drakes and Dragonspawn
Shadows of Margath
Traps and Terrors
Champions of Kellos
Walkers of the Wild
Rituals and Runes
The Cataclysm
The Seven Scions
The Scepter of Kyros
All cards are sleeved and in excellent unplayed condition.
The token sheet for The Cataclysm is unpunched.
All Expansions have the original boxes - some are scuffed but all are structurally sound. The Adventure Variant boxes have their hang tabs taped down (this was the way I received them new).
Also included is one rules pamphlet for each series of expansions so all of the rules necessary to play are here.

    <notes>This listing is for Runebound 2nd edition base game INCLUDING the below expansions:
1) Runebound 2nd Edition (in box)
2) Mists of Zanaga (consolidated)
3) Island of Dread (in box)
4) Sands of Al-Kalim (consolidated)
5) The Frozen Wastes (in box)
6) Relics of Legend - pack (still in packaging)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve consolidated some of these expansions so that I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have so much shelf space taken up with the game (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in 3 boxes - Mists and Sands are consolidated into the Frozen Wastes box). I also made a custom insert (in Frozen Wastes box) and have the individual sets bagged with labels so I know what is what. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also a small plano box included in the base game as well for some of the common markers. Everything is in Like New condition (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played the expansions once each).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been the only owner of these games, and they come from a smoke free / pet free home.  Buyer to pay shipping costs.  Paypal accepted (or cash if local pickup option requested).</notes>

    <notes>I have enough dice-controlled fantasy games by simply owning Talisman.
This game has been played a couple of times but shows little to no wear on the components.  The BGG categorization I gave it states that you could give this game to a friend; I recommend that you purchase it and do so.
Actually, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not THAT bad of a game.  I just haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t gotten around to playing it in years, so it goes out the door in my Great Wargame Purge of 2014.  And hey, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty (90%+) sure there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an expansion deck of cards in there, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember exactly which one.
Shipping is your choice, BUT the listed price does NOT include shipping.  This will be worked out post-sale.  Keep in mind that this is a big, fairly heavy game.</notes>

    <notes>It includes the following expansions: Frozen Waste, Island of Dread, Midnight, and Mists of Zanaga.
You will get ONLY 4 boxes: Runebound, Frozen Waste, Island of Dread, and Midnight.
It appears that it includes all small expansions. They are not in their boxes but in small plastic zip log bags. Please, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask me to find if a particular small expansion is included. There are four boxes filled up with Runebound stuff. There are no insert in the boxes, so the boxes are full of gaming material only.
This maybe a complete Runebound set (minus the boxes).
Condition: All components in great condition. Rules have handwritten clarifications on them.
Shipping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Handling: Please, send me an e-mail and I will let you know about the cost.
Payment: PayPal ONLY.</notes>

    <notes>Verkaufe hier die deutsche Version von Runebound - 2te Edition mit mehreren Erweiterungen und Extrahelden.
Das Spiel wurde 2-3 mal gespielt, ist vom Zustand her komplett fast wie neu, sowohl von der Komponenten als auch der Box.
Nichtraucherhaushalt.
- Grundspiel Runebound - 2. Edition - deutsch (beinhaltet übrigens die guten gravierten Würfel, nicht die bedruckten oder die mit Aufklebern)
- 4 Kartenerweiterungen: Finsterer Wald, Schrecken der Gruft, Legendäre Relikte, Artefakte und Verbündete. Karten sind in der Grundbox, die Verpackungen der Erweiterungen lege ich bei.
- 4 Extra Helden inkl. Figur, Heldenkarte für Runebound und Heldenkarte für Descent (Erste Edition): Jonas, Nara Reißzahn, Tobin und Kel
- Als extra gibt es noch einen Packen farbiger Glassteine, diese haben sich als äußerst praktisch zum Markieren der Abenteuer auf der Karte erwiesen (im Gegensatz zu den nicht immer leicht zu erkennenden Pappmarkern)
Versand bezahlt der Käufer je nach Gewicht und Paketgröße (~7€ für Paket innerhalb Deutschlands).
Bezahlung per Überweisung, PayPal oder Bar bei Abholung (Bremen).
Falls Fragen, immer her damit :)
Der Verkauf erfolgt unter Ausschluss jeglicher Gewähr­leistung.</notes>

    <notes>Played only once at a friend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s house and if not that it is missing 2 x one gold pieces, I should have listed it as very good or like new.
The missing 2 x one gold pieces are very non-crucial (like the money in Monopoly).
All the other components are present (I have gone through it once before listing and thus discovered the missing 2 x one gold pieces) and they are in Very Good to Like New condition.
Buyers pay actual shipping (I do round up to the nearest dollar to cover expanses).
Ships through either UPS or USPS (buyers choice or whichever is the least cost).
Contact me for any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This is a collection listing.   All components are opened, punched, sorted, bagged but in unplayed, like new condition from a smoke free home.  The base game board has some rubbing on the black back of the 4 fold board.  The collection includes the base 2nd edition plus all of the following mini-expansions:  Traps _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Terrors, Beasts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bandits, Rituals _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Runes, Weapons of Legend, Shadows of Margath (revised), Champion of Kellos, Walker of the Wild, Artifacts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies, Drakes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dragonspawn, Terrors of the Tomb, Dark Forest, Relics of Legend, Cataclysm, Crown of Elder Kings, Sceptor of Kyros, Cult of the Rune, Seven Scions, Avatars of Kelnov.  Additionally, this includes the six character decks, Blade Dancer, Runemaster, Shadow Walker, Spiritbound, Battlemage, WIldlander.  All components are included in the base game box.  For the base game, the only missing component is that this includes 53 of 54 exhaustion counters.  For the expansions, there are rules booklets that cover all of the various mini expansions but there are not booklets for each individual mini expansion.  And, for the character deck sets, this collection includes 3 copies of the character deck rules booklet.  The 2nd edition base game box has age wearing and rubbing and a little tearing  but is in very good condition.  I also have other large expansions for sale; please note those listings as well.  Buyer to pay paypal fee and priority mail shipping unless UPS or FedEx can produce a lower shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>This is a nearly complete set of Runebound 2nd Edition and many of it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expansions. Everything is complete, and in Like New condition. Most of it has hardly been played.
All of it is first print runs, as they were bought as the expansions were released. There are only two boxes, and everything fits into both.
The base game box has a custom foam core insert and all of the expansion materials are kept in the box for the Frozen Wastes expansion. There are the only two boxes I have left. The rest were discarded.
All figures are unpainted.
It contains the following:
Runebound 2nd Edition Base Game
Small Boxes:
Artifacts and Allies
Beasts and Bandits
Champions of Kellos
Crown of the Elder Kings
Drakes and Dragonspawn
Relics of Legend
Rituals and Runes
Shadows of Margath
The Dark Forest
Scepter of Kyros
Terrors of the Tomb
Traps and Terrors
Walkers of the Wild
Weapons of Legend
Big Box Expansions:
Midnight
Mists of Zanaga
Sands of Al-Kalim
Frozen Wastes
Island of Dread
I will ONLY ship to the US or Canada, as shipping will be prohibitively expensive to send anywhere else. Keep in mind that this is a HEAVY BOX and it weighs around 40 pounds. Shipping to most continental US states will be around $50. Canada shipping will be a little cheaper, but not by much.
Please keep this in mind, as the buyer will pay the actual shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Huge lot of [b]Second Edition Runebound[/b]. Includes the first two large box expansions plus all the small box expansions except any class decks. Packed in two large boxes (base game and sands) with an included Broken Towen card organizer for the cards. Tokens are sorted in bead boxes which will be included. Everything is in excellent condition: a few of the decks are still in shrink. The game was played about half a dozen times.
26 different hero miniatures are in this lot, plus 10 further hero cards which could be proxied. Lots of variety!

    <notes>Runebound lot -- Selling 2nd edition with several expansion decks.  
Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
Check my other listings and my ratings! 
I only accept PayPal (and only goods and services payments).  
Yes, I will do local pickup.  
Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  
Happy shopping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Happy Gaming!</notes>

    <notes>Included:
Runebound Second Edition Base Game
Boxed Sets (boxes are present, although inserts might be missing)
 - Island of Dread
 - Mists of Zanaga
 - Frozen Wastes
Small Expansions
 - artifacts and allies
 - the dark forest
 - terrors of the tomb
 - relics of legend
 - drakes and dragonspawn
 - shadows of margath (second edition)
 - rituals and runes
 - champions of kellos
 - walkers of the wild
 - traps and terrors
 - beasts and bandits
 - cult of the rune
 - seven scions
The adventure variants aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sleeved and are still in their boxes (but not in shrink). The rest of the cards from all expansions are sleeved. Yeah, it took a long time to sleeve them all. 
The non- _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;adventure variant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards are generally mixed in amongst each other, creating a MASSIVE Market Deck situation, for example. 
The boxes for the Base game and three major expansions are in great shape. 
Pretty much everything from the second edition is included minus Midnight, Sands, all PvP character packs, a few adventure variants, an item expansion or two, and all promo/crossover characters. But most importantly, pics are available on request. Good with phone, dumb with computers!
Shipping will be ugly, but only actual shipping costs will be charged. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m setting the price of this collection at about half of what these items sell for individually. I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find any sales info on two or three of the expansions.
I miiiiight be persuaded to go through the hassle of selling an expansion or two on their own. No guarantees though. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a pain in the arse!
PayPal for the win. 
Thanks,
Mike</notes>

    <notes>This is for a Runebound lot. It is listed in Very Good condtion because all components are complete and in outstanding shape, but please note it has been consolidated into three boxes and many of the small monster/treasure expansions are mixed into the base set cards.

    <notes>This is for my Runebound 1st and 2nd edition collection.  I believe this is everything.  As far as I know it is all un-played.  Definitely un-played by me.  Everything thing is pretty much new in shrink or like new.  Some boxes have a little bit of whitening on corners and basic wear like that.  It has all been sitting in a bin and at this point will never get played by me, so I am putting it up for sale.  Everything is sold as is, so let me know if you have any questions or want any pictures.  There is a lot here, so take that into consideration when thinking about shipping charges.
