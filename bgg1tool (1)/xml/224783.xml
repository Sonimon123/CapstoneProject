I will do my best to ship this as economically as possible and will work with you to use whichever carrier you prefer.
I will be happy to ship outside of the US, but know that the price for shipping internationally can be expensive. Again, I will do everything I can to ship this as economically as possible.
Description:
Vindication (formerly Epoch: The Awakening) is a highly strategic, fantasy-based tabletop journey for 2-5 players. Play time is 15-30 minutes per player.
Thrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins — completely alone with nothing except the breath in your lungs and an undaunted spirit.
Through your advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you’ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes — and regaining honor.
You may perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn: activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain the courage (inspired strength) which allows you to perform a bounty hunt.
There are distinctive end-game triggers that can be affected through game play, over 72 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways for potent combinations, and fresh tile placement each game for high replayability</notes>

    <notes>What is sold is equivalent of Swanky Box pre-order ($79+shipping). I bought the pre-order version ($99+shipping) with component updates after pledge manager closed, to acquire guilds miniatures and tokens. I am keeping monument and guild bling (which were offered as visual upgrades to cardboard tokens) and offering the Swanky Box.
Contents inspected: monster mini was broken but I replaced the broken mini with the good one from my own KS copy so everything in this box is 100% good. Everything else is untouched (cardboard elements come in shrink wrap outside main box, decks sealed, bits bagged). I have the original shipping box, ready to reseal and ship! My loss is your gain.
To be clear: content-wise, this is exactly the same box that you can pre-order today. I actually urge anyone buying to check their pre-order page first. I just offer it at 14% discount. On their webpage, they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the swanky box with the upgraded content anymore. They made the same tray for both editions.</notes>
