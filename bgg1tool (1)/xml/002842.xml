   <description>TransAmerica is a simple railway game. Each player has a set of five cities strung across the U.S. that need to be connected by rail. Players place either one or two rails each turn. The game ends when the first player completes a connected route between their five cities. The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games edition. Game has been played twice.  However, all game components are in good shape and accounted for.
Minimal wear and tear on top game box (around the upper left edge - box beginning to bend in a bit).
I also have the TransAmerica/TransEuropa expansion - Vexation.  It can added to the order for an additional $3.50.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 201)
America in the 19th century: railroads are booming. Pioneer spirit and vision are everywhere. Everyone wants to be the first to build a railroad network across the country. Each player has five cities and tries to connect them with a shared network of tracks. As soon as a player has done this, the round ends. The other players lose points. At the end of the game, the player who has the most points left is the winner. A very simple railway game. The player who can make the best use of the other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; networks is generally victorious. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO201)
America in the 19th century: railroads are booming! Pioneer spirit and vision are everywhere. Everyone wants to be the first to build a railroad network across the country. Each player has five cities and tries to connect them with a shared network of tra cks. As soon as a player has done this, the round ends. The other players lose points. At the end of the game, the player who has the most points left is the winner! Who will be the first to connect his cities? Is it Casey, who was the first t o build through the mountains to the west? Or Annie, who was the one who best made use of the others_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; tracks? </notes>

    <notes>The game board is in great shape. The cards are slightly used. I counted the pieces and the rules, 85 tracks, 6 trains, 5 starting markers, and 36 cards are in the box. 
There is 1 white starting marker (wooden cylinder) that is missing and could be easily replaced/substituted. It does not affect the game in any way and we never missed its absence.</notes>

    <notes>This is a new copy in factory shrink wrap.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the 2002 version of TransAmerican that includes Vexation expanded rules and tracks.
I received it with a slight tear, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d say about an inch or less, on the front of the box.  The box itself is unaffected (or I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have purchased it myself).  The only other thing I can see is a slight bit of white on two of the bottom corners, but they are both still inside of shrink.  (I am pretty picky about condition.)  Since I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not set up for returns, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like a photo of any aspect of the game, just email me.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it $6 below what I paid  (purchased it with some other games) because I already have TransEuro.
If I was choosing one, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d probably pick TransAmerican because I think it plays a little better given the layout of the cities, but TransEuro was already open....
As seller, I will pay PayPal fees and BGG fees.  I would expect shipping to be $10 to most places, and anyway probably wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge more than that -- only less if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s less.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO201)
America in the 19th century: railroads are booming! Pioneer spirit and vision are everywhere. Everyone wants to be the first to build a railroad network across the country. Each player has five cities and tries to connect them with a shared network of tracks. As soon as a player has done this, the round ends. The other players lose points. At the end of the game, the player who has the most points left is the winner! Who will be the first to connect his cities? Is it Casey, who was the first t o build through the mountains to the west? Or Annie, who was the one who best made use of the others_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; tracks?</notes>
