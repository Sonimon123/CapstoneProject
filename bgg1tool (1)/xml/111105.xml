   <description>A STORYTELLING BOARD GAME SET IN THE 1970s COLD WAR ERA._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SMERSH is a portmanteau of two Russian words that translates to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Death to Spies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;  It operated as a counter-intelligence agency by the Red Army during the 1940s. Despite having had a large number of paid employees, little was known about the agency until recently when Russia opened their archives._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies set in an alternate 1970s timeline against a newly formed and independent SMERSH. Agents of SMERSH includes custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters,  and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game.  There are plenty of James Bond gadgets, guns, cars, pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor.  The game features the artwork of George Patsouras (The Resistance _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Flash Point)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is able to accommodate play with either The Encounter Book, which contains over 1500 written encounters with a similar reaction matrix to Tales of the Arabian Nights -  or played more simply with only encounter cards with shorter encounters and no matrix. The First Edition (2012) of the game came with the Encounter Cards as standard, and the Encounter Book as an optional add-on (although many copies did actually include the book). The Second Edition (2015) includes the Encounter Book as standard, with the Encounter Cards available to purchase from the publisher._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Für den Versand in Deutschland kommen 7 Euro hinzu.

The box was opened for the author to sign the Encounter Book so is not sealed.
All parts are accounted for, tokens unpunched and the cards sealed.
Includes the extra characters and the travel die.
I will ship only to the lower 48 USA.
Shipping will be the actual cost of the USPS priority box.
I live in Los Angeles (the South Bay area) and work in Irvine if you prefer a cash face-to-face delivery.

    <notes>While this game is marked as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; I did just receive it.  However, the box did receive some box damage during shipment.  I can try to take a picture upon receipt.  None of the game components are damaged though, and the game is complete.  
This was the $70 Kickstarter level. Bought the game because it looked cool, but after looking it over decided it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t exactly what I thought it was.
Contact me with questions.

    <notes>This is actually new, but it arrived to me unsealed.  Pieces are still unpunched and cards are sealed.  Comes with all the Kickstarter bonuses.
There is some wear along the edges of the box, as the game arrived unsealed and without padding during the initial shipment.
If you purchase multiple games from me, I will be happy to combine the games together in one box to help you save on shipping costs.
Local pickup is available around Camarillo, CA.
I will ship your package by USPS. I charge the actual shipping cost plus $1 for handling.</notes>

    <notes>This entry is for:
Agents of Smersh with ALL KS promos, New, opened but unplayed. -- It came opened because the rulebook is signed.
Swagman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Hope with ALL KS promos, New in Shrink.
In short, it is the entire game.  I realize that the promos are hard to find and selling for high $$ amounts; however, I just want to get everything back that I put into backing the game.  The rulebook is signed, also.
From a non-smoking home, well cared for.  Box is large, so expect a bit on shipping, though I will go as low as I can get for you.
If you want me to get a quote for shipping to overseas, I will ask for $5 before I do so.  Sorry, but I have too many people who do this and then don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t order that it has become not worth my time.</notes>

    <notes>Includes the big adventure book *and* all KS-exclusive content from the original Kickstarter campaign (http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/147552/agents-of...).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling the expansion with more KS-exclusives. You can save on shipping by buying them both at once.
Opened and carefully played only once, everything is present and in pristine condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>Excellent, like new condition.  Contains story book and all standard 1st edition components.  Game has only been played once.  Feel free to contact me if you would like pictures or additional details.
Fast shipping guaranteed!  I will ship via FedEx Ground within one business day of purchase.  There will be a flat rate of $9.99 for shipping.  That will be significantly less expensive than most options available!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to shipping outside the US or accepting a different method of paypal, but you will need to contact me beforehand as shipping and other variables may change to fit the unique circumstances.
On a final note: I would be willing to bundle Shinobi Wat-aah! with Agents of Smersh for an extra $12!  This won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect shipping prices or anything.  Merely looking to make some space on my gaming shelf.  Let me know if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested.</notes>

    <notes>This is a KickStarter version of Agents of Smersh in great shape. 
It includes the Book of Encounters that has been signed by Jason Maxwell as thanks for backing the KickStarter campaign.
Extra secret agents and villians are included as well as special dice. All small bits are nicely organized in a plastic organizer to cut down on box clutter. The dice come in a fabulous red velvet bag. I have also printed off some color player aids from BGG and laminated one as well. These really add to the flow of the game and ease new players into the story.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in a great story game, this is the version to get as the extras really add flavor to the tale.
The box does have slight damage, but the components are perfect. Only played a few times.</notes>

    <notes>My group was not triggered by the retheme of Tales of the Arabian Nights. So this copy has just the shrink wrap of the box removed and was checked for completeness.
No shrink wrap around the box
Boards still unpunched!
Cards still in shrink!
If you would like to see any additional pictures, just send me a geekmail and I will happily provide them.
And if you have any questions, please ask!
Please note: Shipping ONLY to EU and with tracking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; insurance!
Shipping costs:
to Austria AND Germany - 6 Euro - includes tracking and insurance
to EU - 16 Euro - includes tracking and insurance
Payment method A (preferred): via transfer to my EU bank account via IBAN/BIC in advance
Payment method B: via PayPal. Please note that if you choose this option, I would ask you to split the PayPal fee evenly. In this case, 1,4 Euro/2 -_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 0,7 Euro.
So the total price will be 35,7 Euro + shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the original retail version of Agens of SMERSH, plus a copy of [thing=138559][/thing] ordered direct from 8th Summit, plus the 1st Edtion Full Upgrade pack from the 2015 Agents of SMERSH 2nd Edition KS which includes [thing=170560][/thing] and [thing=179814][/thing]. From that, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure it comes with everything released, but ask if you want me to check to make sure of something specific. All material is stored in the base game box - the expansion Swagman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Hope box contains older versions of items and duplicate items, and can be pitched rather than shipped to save on shipping cost. Base game played once or twice, expansions unplayed, everything in very good to like new condition. At this point it would be too difficult to split this up, but if it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell and you want just the expansions, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see what I can do. English first edition (2012) 8th Summit (updated to second edition).

    <notes>The second edition of the base game with the Written Encounters Deck and the Swagman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Hope expansion, all new in shrink.  The [thing=179814]All the Kickstarter Promos[/thing] package, the [thing=170560]Showdown![/thing] scenario book and the Dr. Lobo bust are also included.  There looks to be some damage to the very top of the base game box that occurred during shipping, resulting in some creasing and a slight concavity on the affected edges.</notes>
