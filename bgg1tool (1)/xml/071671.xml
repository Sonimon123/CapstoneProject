   <description>Yggdrasil is a co-operative game in which players are different gods of the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor, Tyr, Frey, Heimdall and Freyja. Monsters, the wolf Fenrir, the huge serpent Jormungand, the Fire Giant Surt, the Goddess of the Dead Hel, the traitor Loki and the cosmic dragon Nidh_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ouml;gg are moving forward in Asgard inescapably and announce the impending coming of chaos and destruction on the world-tree Yggdrasil. Together the players have to resist to the impending coming of the Evil forces in Asgard, the gods' world._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game flow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During his turn, the active player first draws an Enemy card, corresponding to one of the six Evil creatures. The corresponding counter is moved one space forward in Asgard and the associated effect applies. Then the active player performs three different actions among the nine at his disposal in order to resist to the advance:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Ask for the Elves' help_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Get (or improve) a Weapon from the Dwarves_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Send the Valkyries looking for Vikings' souls on the mankind world of Midgard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Fight the Fire Giants and try to gather the parts of a magic rune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Negotiate with the Vanir_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Get rid of the Fire Giants who invade Midgard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Get the Vikings back from Hel's world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Exchange forces with another god_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Fight against the Enemies in Asgard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player, depending on the god he plays, has a specific power that allows him to perform some actions better. All of these actions have to be used at the right moment or the victory will be unreachable. The players will need cleverness, calm, and team spirit to challenge the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7075)
Yggdrasil, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;terrible steed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, a cosmic ash tree that supports the nine worlds, is in jeopardy. As the Ragnarök approaches, you, mighty among the Æsir and Vanir Gods, have to face the relentless advance of Evil Forces. You must sacrifice everything to prevent Evil from destroying Yggdrasil. The last battle, predicted since the dawn of time, is starting now. Your only aim is to repel the Evil Forces in order for Yggdrasil to survive this universe at war.
Yggdrasil is a co-operative game for 1-6 players. Playing the role of a Norse god, you must, with the other players, stop the advancing Evil Forces in Asgard.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Yggradsil
Description: Used, complete and in great shape.
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>Never played, immaculate condition.
Buyer pays actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred. International buyers must also cover insurance (usually only $2-3 extra) to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Will accept PayPal, money orders, OLGS gift cards, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s or personal checks but buyer will need to cover any associated fees other than the 3% going to BGG. 
Feel free to peruse my trade and marketplace feedback to get a feel for how much I invest in making sure every person I deal with is absolutely thrilled with what they get.
If you have any questions, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask! 
Kind Regards,

    <notes>INCLUDES FRIGG PROMO
This game has been played just a few times and all components are complete and in great shape. The cards have no wear. For whatever reason, this game doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see the table very often, so I thought I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d let someone else try it. There is very slight cosmetic damage to the bottom of the box. The previous owner had taped the box shut, and in my removal of the tape, I peeled of a very small (~1 cm2)  area of the box art. 
This does NOT include the Asgard expansion.
Shipping will be USPS flat rate.</notes>

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - Yggdrasil - has been played 4 times at the most, after having bought it second-hand in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition myself. Box cover has a few scuff marks but is pretty much unscathed (hence the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition) and all the cards and other game components are still in either _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition. I do take good care of my games :) ...
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/gideongrim ...</notes>
