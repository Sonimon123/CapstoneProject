You (and a partner) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Basic Deck:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     8 Door cards - two each of red, blue, green and brown_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     10 Nightmare cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     58 Labyrinth cards:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         16 red chambers:     3 keys, 4 moons, 9 suns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         15 blue chambers:    3 keys, 4 moons, 8 suns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         14 green chambers:   3 keys, 4 moons, 7 suns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         13 brown chambers:   3 keys, 4 moons, 6 suns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Three mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the basic game:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Towers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    In _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4063)
You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out - or you will remain trapped forever!
You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.
Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game: you (and a partner) must work (together) against the game, and gather the 8 Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding -under specific circumstances- one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand, and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...
There are also several mini-expansions, all compatible with one another. Three of those expansions are included with the basic game:
In _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;The Book of Steps Lost and Found_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, you must find the 8 Door cards in a randomly given order, and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task. 
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;The Towers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; introduces a new type of card, which allows more searching and deck manipulation, but also requires an additional victory condition... 
Finally, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; adds evil _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;time bombs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest, and helpful but unreliable allies...</notes>

Shipping will be based on actual shipping costs, likelihood around $4.  Check my other sales to see if you would like multiple items to save on shipping.  Being such a small game I would think this would be an excellent candidate to buy with another game.</notes>
