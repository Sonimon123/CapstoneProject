    <notes>This game is BRAND NEW and SEALED. I bought it from CoolStuffInc.com and it came with a V shaped (factory?) slit on the shrink wrap. It is a perfect 1.5 inch V shaped slit, that is why I assume it is from the factory. 
I am selling this for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;so cheap_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because I bought 2 copies when it was released and realized that I was a bit over zealous with my spending. I am just trying to make my money back. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a great game that comes with a very large board and many game pieces. 
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H will probably cost between $10 and $15 depending where you live. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a heavy box. Obviously, I will determine the exact S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H for you when the time comes.
Thank you.

    <notes>The game comes complete with official replacement battle strip and the missing Japanese Tactical Bombers. The bombers are still in their original seal.
Only removed wrap and opened the box once. Never been played with, as I cannot find the right players for this fabulous war game.
Images and shipping costs on demand.
In case you pay with PayPal, I will charge you the PayPal fee (4%) as I already happily take care of the BGG fee.</notes>

    <notes>Punched but never been played, minor crunch on box bottom.  I thoroughly reviewed the contents and it is complete except the manual says 10 6-sided dice and I only had six.  I added four more, but they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the same color as the six.  Obviously you can play with any six-sided dice.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for 115oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOCA06260000)
A World War II strategy game. Its the Empire of Japan against the Allied powers of the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom. You control the Japanese forces or one of the Allied powers. You command your country_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s military forces and its war time economy. Japan will try to dominate half of the world as it builds its forces and maneuvers its fleet in the Pacific region. As one of the Allied powers you must cooperate with the other Allied powers to make a common defense to thwart Japan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dominance. Rewrite how the battle progresses and leave your mark on history. This game is compatible with Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Europe 1940. Combine the two games to create the ultimate experience of full scale global conflict! </notes>

    <notes>UPDATE: This has been claimed but not officially ordered yet. This customer now has first dibs as long as he pays within a few days (11/15/17). 
Mint condition for box, components and everything. I take extremely good care of all my games and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t let them get handled with anything that might cause damage. This was played only once. If you want closer pictures of anything than what is below, please contact me.
This is the second edition which has updated rules and set up after play balance issues were found with 1st edition that had Alpha 1, 2 and 3 rules before finally settling on revised rules and set up that were implemented in this edition.
Shipping will be cheapest way possible and estimates are available upon request. This item is too large to fit in USPS large flat rate box so it will be at least $15 plus domestic. Faster shipping or different carriers are available if customer is willing to pay of course.</notes>
