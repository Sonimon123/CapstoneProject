This new game by Carl Chudyk is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times. Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!
To win, you must score achievements, which you can attain by amassing points or by meeting certain criteria with the innovations you have built. Plan your civilization well, and outmaneuver your opponents, and with some luck you will achieve victory!

Innovation is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times. Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well! </notes>

    <notes>This edition is the English language IELLO version (the one with the really nice art on the cards that you have to import from Europe). Only played twice, all cards in excellent condition. Click to browse the 18 images on BGG at this link: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/132358/english-second-edition
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a much more beautiful and eye-pleasing version of the game, I just never play it.
Will ship however you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pay for, from zip code 95472 in Northern California. All my games are from a smoke-free and cat-free house. Feel free to combine shipping with any of the other games I have for sale:

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $9 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

Innovation is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times. Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well! </notes>

Innovation is a journey through innovations from the stone age through modern times. Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!</notes>

    <notes>Asmadi Games (ASN0150)
Innovation is a civilization-building card game by the designer of Glory to Rome, Carl Chudyk. It contains 105 cards organized into 10 progressing ages, each representing a different idea, technology, or innovation throughout history. Every card has a unique ability, leading to interesting combos, interactions, and diversified play experiences across multiple games. It is built on simple base mechanics, with the complexity deriving from the wide variety of game text on the cards. It won the 2010 Golden Geek Award for Best Card Game, awarded by BoardGameGeek. Innovation Third Edition is a new packaging for the base set of Innovation. It features all new card illustrations, graphical design, and game balance updates.</notes>

For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>English first edition, first printing.
This original edition did not come in shrink wrap, at least for the pre-orders.  I was one of the ones in the work party who helped assemble these (see my profile/gallery for pics of us doing that).
Bonus: alternative _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Engineering_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Gunpowder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards, these were not included in the released version.  Difference is instead of all top cards with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;two or more_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of that symbol, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just all top cards with that symbol.</notes>
