   <description>In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.  In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops.  Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army.  Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.  Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Many alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King?   Will you use the Merchant's Guild to gain more influence in the Council, or will you go for balanced development?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Weight: 1,285 kg
Theme: The realm of Kingsburg is under attack! Monstrous invaders are gathering at the borders, aiming to invade and plunder the realm! Your King has chosen you to take charge of a province on the border: you will manage your province and help defend the realm. To accomplish this task, you must influence the King’s advisors and the royal family to obtain gold, wood, stone, and soldiers to expand and defend your lands. But you are not the only governor seeking the aid of the advisors! The other players also seek to collect the best resources for their own territories. Can you outwit hem to get what you need? Building a new statue of the King will certainly please him, but your soldiers also need a new barracks and the master of the Merchant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guild wants you to build a new market! Can you neglect your defence long enough to expand your economy instead? Will you train more soldiers, or build stronger walls? The choice is up to you! In the end, only one governor will earn a place ampong the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s advisors. Will that governor be you?

It is being sold because no one else will play it with me... but considering I also bought dominion, can you really blame them?

This listing also includes Quixo and Ticket to Ride: The Card Game
Only listed as Very Good because it is out of shrink and punched, but never played.  
I prefer paypal, but other arrangements for payment are possible if you geekmail me prior to adding the game to your cart and checking out.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere, but the buyer assumes all responsibility for shipping or post charges.  I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge you any more than it costs me to ship it.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing a bunch of games this month and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this professionally so please bear with me and be reasonable when it comes to shipping time.  If you purchase and pay Friday evening my time, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect the package to go out until Monday at the soonest.  I should be able to go to the post office for simple domestic shipping several times a week, but I probably will consolidate all overseas shipments to one weekly trip.
Check out my other games listed.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to offer multi-game order discounts and combined shipping, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not making it a rock-solid offer because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want someone getting $5 off each additional game and then buying 10 card games or something that would only sell for $5-$10 anyways.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to be generous to stir up sales, but not take a Net Loss on everything any more than I have to.
If you have any other questions or would like to request that I put up a particular game from my collection, Geekmail me with a reasonable offer.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m kinda making decisions as I go along through my collection, so I would probably be willing to sell a game I was on the fence about if I knew there was a guaranteed sale imminent.
Thanks!</notes>

Players adopt the role of a governor, and vie for resources to build up their province, military power to defend their homes, and above all the influence of the King. Over five years (five turns) players rely on various advisors to the King for resources. From tangibles like gold, wood, and stone to soldiers and portents, each acquisition will shape the future of your community.</notes>

Players adopt the role of a governor, and vie for resources to build up their province, military power to defend their homes, and above all the influence of the King. Over five years (five turns) players rely on various advisors to the King for resources. From tangibles like gold, wood, and stone to soldiers and portents, each acquisition will shape the future of your community.</notes>

    <notes>All cards are sleeved and I cut all chits from their trees using a hobby knife to ensure no tearout, everything is in perfect condition, with no sign of wear at all. Box is perfect. More than happy to upload pictures of anything, just let me know.
The only reason I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, is because, in fairness, it has been played four times on my gaming table which has a microfibre surface. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very OCD with my game collection so keep my games in as-close-to-perfect order as possible. I store all my games vertically.
I pack games in a sturdy cardboard box with a lot of bubble wrap.
Thanks for looking, if you have any questions just let me know.
I have both Kingsburg and Kingburg: To Forge A Realm for sale, happy to bundle them together to save postage of course.</notes>

    <notes>My collection is taking up too much room in my tiny Boston apartment, unfortunately. Selling games that don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see much play.
Listed as Acceptable only because it is missing one Yellow Building Token out of seventeen.  Game is perfectly playable with sixteen tokens.  Beautiful condition otherwise.  Almost no wear; played half a dozen times.

    <notes>Selling Kingsburg and To Forge a Realm expansion all in the expansion box (yes it all fits comfortably). Both games are the original artwork from the earlier edition before the art got changed.
Shipping is from the DC metro area. Also available for local pickup.
This game components are like new but played a few times. The box has some very minor corner scuffing and a scratch on the top of the lid that is not very noticable. All components are bagged and accounted for. This game is currently out of print from what I understand.
Payment for the game is expected via Paypal within a week of the invoice being sent.
Shipping costs are done according to what is cheapest for the buyer. Typically, this will be via USPS Priority Mail flat rate box which includes a tracking #. The shipping weight of this item is ~3 lbs.</notes>
