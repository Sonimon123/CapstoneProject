   <description>Each morning, Odin sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to race over the world of Midgard and report back what they have seen. The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Magic Way_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; during the round _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The second edition of Odin's Ravens transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Odin deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire. Whoever reaches the end of the world first wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>First edition from Rio Grande, in English.
In super condition, having only been played once.  Other than the lack of shrink-wrap, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have a hard time distinguishing it from a new copy.  Adult-owned, from a smoke-free home.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include an errata sheet.  Contact me if you have additional questions.
The game weighs 12 oz.  If packed lightly, I should be able to ship it at the 1 lb. rate anywhere in the U.S. by two-day priority mail for $3.85.  So that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay for shipping if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 205)
Exciting flying races for two
Each morning, Odin, the father of the Gods, sends his two ravens: Hugin and Mugin out into the world to watch over the land. The players try to help the feathered spies along their way over the various lands of the northern hemisphere. To move the ravens, the players must play appropriate flight cards from their hands. They may also get help directly from Odin. With skillful use of the cards, a player can move his raven quickly over the land.

    <notes>Original English version by Rio Grande Games. Brand new in original shrinkwrap and in perfect condition. A real gem! Game was donated to a games library for students and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to use the funds to buy something more desired.
Game is OOP (Out of Print) and is (near) impossible to find in this condition. Publisher has indicated that there are no plans for re-issuing or reprinting this game. Suitable for collecting, gifting, and playing. 
AS OF THIS LISTING, THIS IS CURRENTLY THE CHEAPEST AVAILABLE PRICE FOR OBTAINING THIS GAME IN THIS CONDITION IN NORTH AMERICA. :)
Shipping calculated based upon where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re located. Buyer pays actual shipping cost plus $3 packing costs.
Buy with confidence! Please feel free to email me with any questions. I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sold much on BGG, but all the people I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold to have been 100% satisfied. I can gladly provide references if desired.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only asking what I paid for it a few weeks even though some places are charging quite a bit more due to the difficulty in finding this game.

    <notes>This is the Kosmos/Rio Grande version of Odin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Ravens, and it is in very good condition.  The game has been well-cared for, and only shows some minimal wear on two of the box corners.  The actual game pieces are all there, and they are in excellent condition.  This game was only played a couple times, so the cards are still like new.  
This game can be picked up at GenCon Indy 2012 to avoid shipping costs.</notes>

However, the box, board, and pieces are in spotless condition. I am very particular about caring for my games. All components are present. This is the English language edition.

Can send pictures of anything if wanted
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice. </notes>
