   <description>In ancient Rome, tribunes were highly esteemed individuals elected by the people to represent them politically and militarily.  In the board game Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family.  By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the mind of the highly acclaimed designer of Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune  is a combination of worker placement and set collection.  Each round the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives and/or attempt to take over factions.  In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group.  That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants.  Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option.  In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Very nice shape, no issues, set up but never played. Should be a 3 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.

    <notes>This is for the base game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tribune: Primus Inter Pares_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tribune Expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion all in the base game box.
The game is complete and in great condition.  It has been played twice, once without the expansion and once with.  I like it, my gaming group doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t - so off it goes.
There is no damage to any game component, and the box has some very minor shelf wear (minimal wear on the corners).
My default shipping service is USPS Parcel Post with delivery confirmation. This usually is the cheapest shipping option.  Upon request, I will ship with a different carrier or different service.

    <notes>(Expansion for this game is already in the box, you must buy the expansion as well if you purchase this item from me!)
Never played, absolutely pristine condition, no shelf wear.  Whatever insert the game came with has been removed. 
Optional Plano case (see photo) included if you want to pay $7 extra (I will ask when I send you the final price).  It fits nicely into the box and holds many of the components.  Otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll transfer those components to a baggie.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for 91oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.
High-resolution photo available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>New and in shrink.
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately.  
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost.  I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.
Thank you</notes>

FFGTR01 Tribune Board Game by Fantasy Flight Games
Welcome to the most complex metropolis of the ancient world + Rome. More than 2000 years ago, Rome was a town full of life whose inhabitants, although they could not have been more different, still had one thing in common: They were all Romans.
In Tribune, 2-5 players each control one of the large and ambitious patrician families of ancient Rome who thirst for influence and power, exerting their influence on the citys many varied factions. Send your followers out into the streets of Rome to win influential allies and use them to control the city.
Will you win over the Legions? Will you be crowned with laurel wreaths, control the Senators, and gain the favor of the Gods?
Tribune is Karl-Heinz Schmiels game of politics and power in ancient Rome for 2-5 players aged 12 and up, playable in 1-2 hours.

For shipping this is considered a very large size game, and can only ship via FedEx.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) or long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
