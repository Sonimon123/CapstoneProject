   <description>After the immediate response to Richard Breese's Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Glück contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.  Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Keydom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Microbadges:    (Buy One)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;      Aladdin's Dragons fan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is NOT in it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shrinkwrap, but is  unplayed. A handfull of tiles/markers have fallen out of the die cuts, but the majority are still in the sprues. One artifact tile was punched, and has had a bit of tearing on the back, but it is a Lamp tile, which everyone gets to start the game with, so this will in NO WAY impact play. The cards are still in their shrinkwrap.</notes>

    <notes>999 Games – Morgenland
Language: Dutch
3 to 5 players
10 year and older
Duration: about 60 min
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,440 kg
Theme: After the immediate response to Richard Breese_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Glück contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game. Aladdin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation. The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially. After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved. The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game. The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; actions. The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games edition.
The game is in very good condition. All parts present _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; in excellent condition. It has only been played a handful of times.
The box has a couple of very minor lid creases which were present when the game was first purchased from new.
I will charge the exact postage the item will cost plus £1 to cover packing costs.
I am happy to combine items from my marketplace to make the postage cheapest possible.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the process of cleaning out the game cabinet. Look back for more deals later. For open and played games, expect prices below what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay at an online discounter.
Shipping: I will ship most games USPS Priority Mail using a flat rate box plus Shipping Confirmation - Estimated Actual Cost: $12.45. I will make every attempt to get you the cheapest and most timely shipping possible.
All games come from a non-smoking, careful environment. I hope you enjoy owning and playing these games as much as I have.
I accept Paypal or Money Order or Cashiers Check.
I do not accept personal checks because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship your game quickly with that payment method.
Currently only shipping to the U.S. If you are in a foreign country and really want one of these games, contact me and I will try to accommodate you - be aware that international shipping costs may be substantially higher.</notes>

I will ship via USPS, and will charge only exact shipping (no handling fee) once I know the destination, and your preferred shipping method (Priority, Parcel-Post, Insurance, etc).
PayPal is preferred. Otherwise, prepaying with Money Order or Cashiers Check will insure fast shipping. Personal checks will require a few days for clearance.

    <notes>New but Ding-n-dent
The game is still new in shrinkwrap, but the box top is a somewhat concave.  There are bends (kinda like thick creases, but NO tears) along the left edge and the upper-right corner of the cover itself, but the sidewalls are all fully intact.  If you can deal with some cosmetic imperfections, this is a great game!
Shipping is at-cost via FedEx Ground or USPS.  For a game this heavy, FedEx is likely cheaper, specially if you have a work address I can ship to.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrinkwrap.  English edition by Rio Grande Games.
My last two copies have minor damage:
#1 has a small scrape on the bottom (less than 1 cm²) that has rubbed off the art near one edge. 
#2 has a slightly smooshed upper right corner. 
Neither appears troubling to me, but you can pick the one you prefer.  (I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even notice either of them until someone specifically asked me to inspect the boxes, so I updated the listing.)
Shipping via USPS or FedEx Ground, whichever is cheaper for you. I get negotiated rates for FedEx at my office, so it is usually cheaper, even more so if you have a business address I can ship to.</notes>

I will ship economy (and only charge accordingly) unless the buyer specifies a desire for something else. Please indicate if insurance is desired so I can get a proper rate to you. I will ship within 1-2 business days, depending on how easy it is to find an appropriate box. I always pack shipments very carefully.</notes>

Shipping:
I am happy to combine shipping on multiple items.
I can ship from both US and (if you are patient) Canada.
I will find the cheapest shipping method. Within the continental USA, this is typically Fedex. International shipping can be very expensive. 
Insurance and tracking:
I recommend paying for both of these. As a hobbyist and an individual seller, I cannot take responsibility for items that are damaged or lost in transit.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
No longer in shrink, but still unplayed.  Cards are still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.  RGG
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
