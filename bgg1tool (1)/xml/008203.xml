   <description>In Hey, That's My Fish!, players want to catch as many fish as possible with their waddle of penguins. Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns. When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands. The player who collects the most fish wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>SAVE OVER 30% ON THIS PRE-ORDER!!!  
Remember, this is a pre-order so the game(s) will not ship from our store until it has officially been released!!!  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s current due date is:  December, 2005 (note, this date may change!)
Be sure to make this purchase separate from any others if you wish to have us send all in-stock games before this release.  Otherwise, we will wait till all games requested have arrived in store!
Items are shipped within one or two business days upon reciept of payment (remember, money order, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check or cash at your own risk!) If you do not wish to send payment and would rather pay us directly, you can give us a call at 816.554.7333 (Tuesday through Saturday) using Visa, Mastercard and American Express or by contacting us in order to make a Paypal payment (a 4.5% surcharge will be added to the total payment.)
Shipping is based off of weight so it completely depends on the game(s) themselves though the average is $7 - $9.00 throughout the Continental US (and yes, we will combine on shipping!!!).  If you need a specific type of shipping - such as Overnight or with Insurance - or have any  questions, drop us an email. MO orders pay 7.35% sales tax.  </notes>

Look for hungry penguins in this fast playing and exciting boardgame by Alvydas Jakeliunas and Günter Cornett is highly suitable for families and strategy gamers. The game box contains 60 ice floe tiles, 16 wooden penguins and short instructions.
At the pole your Penguins are jumping from ice floe to ice floe hunting fish. They’re also trying to block other Penguins and secure the best fishing grounds for themselves. The Penguin colony that catches the most fish by the end of the game wins.
For 2-4 players, ages 8+, 20 minutes.</notes>

    <notes>Phalanx Games - Hey! That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s My Fish! (Deluxe Edition)
Language: Dutch
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 8+
Duration: about 20 min
Weight: 0.975 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: A short game in which players control a number of penguins. The penguins move over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player takes the hex from where the penguin started his movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which other players can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t cross. If a penguin can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t move, he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s taken from play. The player with the most fish in the end wins.

    <notes>Hey! That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s My Fish Board Game by Mayfair and Phalanx Games.
English Edition from 2005.
This is the much nicer first edition with larger tiles and wooden penguins.
All game components are in excellent condition, but the box has a piece of tape on one side. The box cardboard was not actually torn, just the paper covering on the outside of the cardboard.</notes>

    <notes>Edition with plastic penguins.
Box has a number of notable wear points from over the years:
1) whitening on small section throughout the top and bottom of box. 
2) the box top has light, scribbling indentations over most of it. One is immediately clear to see when looking head on to the box and another 8-10 can be seen at various angles of light.
3) one side of the box has a 1/8in (~3mm) punch in it that goes through the outer box and dents the inner box.    
Box itself remains structurally unaffected by these issues.
Play pieces are in like-new condition having only been played with a few times.</notes>
