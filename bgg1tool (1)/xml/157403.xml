   <description>Pirates, merchants, and even the occasional captain of a Navy ship all seek glory and fortune on the Caribbean seas!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the tactical card-driven board game Black Fleet, you're in command of three different types of ships: your merchant ship earns you doubloons by conveying goods from one port to another, your pirate ship by attacking and stealing goods from merchants and burying them on islands, and the Navy ships by sinking your opponents' pirate ships. With your (not-always-honestly-won) money, you'll improve your ships by buying advancement cards, giving you powerful additional abilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Outwit your opponents with fortune cards and combos, earn money faster than they do, and pay the ransom for the governor's daughter to win the game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Kindly note: The Geek does not provide the option of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Will ship to UK only_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  So I had to choose _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  But past experience has shown that postal rates make the purchase of a single game from overseas - even to Europe - uneconomic.</notes>

    <notes>Beautifully-produced game of pirates and merchantmen. Players use their cards to transport goods across the sea – or to steal them from other players! Not only does it look terrific, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a very clever game.
