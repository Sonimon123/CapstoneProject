ALL NEW EDITION: SOLITAIRE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; TWO-PLAYER
RAF: Lion vs Eagle
 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
-- Winston Churchill
France has fallen. England stands alone against the might of a triumphant Germany, defended only by the Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons of the Royal Air Force. Hitler orders his mighty Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in preparation for Operation Sealion - the invasion of England. German fighters and bombers fill the English skies and the RAF responds.
Now you command the RAF or the Luftwaffe in history_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest air campaign - the Battle of Britain. Improving on his award winning solitaire classic, designer John Butterfield ramps up the historical accuracy, tension and play options with three complete games.
RAF: Lion puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to German raids. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unique card system generates targets and forces, which may remain hidden until after you commit your squadrons.  Your foe is no mindless system: the Luftwaffe has priorities and a strategy. Scenarios range from one raid day, taking an hour to complete, to the full campaign, playable in 12 hours.
RAF: Eagle puts you in control of the Luftwaffe forces raiding England. You schedule raids and assign missions to your bombers and fighters, attempting to deliver the knockout blow.  Can you take out the British radar system and cripple their aircraft production? The game controls the RAF response to your strategies. How does a foe so close to defeat keep coming back?
RAF: 2-Player pits you against a live opponent, one controlling Fighter Command and the other the raiding Luftwaffe forces.  Historical features include: German high command priorities, close escort, free hunt, the Channel Patrol, Jabos, day and night bombing, radar, the Observer Corps, weather, ULTRA intercepts, squadron patrols, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;big wings,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; altitude advantage, ace squadrons and flak.

Now you command the RAF or the Luftwaffe in history_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest air campaign - the Battle of Britain. Improving on his award winning solitaire classic, designer John Butterfield ramps up the historical accuracy, tension and play options with three complete games.
RAF: Lion puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to German raids. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unique card system generates targets and forces, which may remain hidden until after you commit your squadrons. Your foe is no mindless system: the Luftwaffe has priorities and a strategy. Scenarios range from one raid day, taking an hour to complete, to the full campaign, playable in 12 hours.
RAF: Eagle puts you in control of the Luftwaffe forces raiding England. You schedule raids and assign missions to your bombers and fighters, attempting to deliver the knockout blow. Can you take out the British radar system and cripple their aircraft production? The game controls the RAF response to your strategies. How does a foe so close to defeat keep coming back?
RAF: 2-Player pits you against a live opponent, one controlling Fighter Command and the other the raiding Luftwaffe forces. Historical features include: German high command priorities, close escort, free hunt, the Channel Patrol, Jabos, day and night bombing, radar, the Observer Corps, weather, ULTRA intercepts, squadron patrols, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;big wings,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; altitude advantage, ace squadrons and flak.

    <notes>I received this in trade so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not up to my usual standard! The maps and chits are in excellent condition but The Lion rulebook has A LOT of writing in the margins, although it is very neat. There is also a small stain on the outside back page. The cards and the box are very good indeed.

    <notes>Decision Games (DCG1019)
France has fallen. England stands alone against the might of a triumphant Germany, defended only by the Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons of the Royal Air Force. Hitler orders his mighty Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in preparation for Operation Sealion - the invasion of England. German fighters and bombers fill the English skies and the RAF respond Now you command the RAF or the Luftwaffe in history_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest air campaign - the Battle of Britain. Improving on his award winning solitaire classic, designer John Butterfield ramps up the historical accuracy, tension and play options with three complete games. RAF: Lion puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to German raids. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unique card system generates targets and forces, which may remain hidden until after you commit your squadrons. Your foe is no mindless system: the Luftwaffe has priorities and a strategy. Scenarios range from one raid day, taking an hour to complete, to the full campaign, playable in 12 hours. </notes>

    <notes>Complete. Never been played, counters still unpunched, maps have never been opened. Only reason not listed LIKE NEW are listed below.
Only condition issues are on the edges of a few cards where binding with rubber bands has caused some small dents, this was before I got it. I have since removed the bands and separated the cards by type into baggies.
The box has some minimal wear.
Collection can be arranged for Central or SW london to save on postage.

    <notes>Decision Games (DCG1019)
France has fallen. England stands alone against the might of a triumphant Germany, defended only by the Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons of the Royal Air Force. Hitler orders his mighty Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in preparation for Operation Sealion - the invasion of England. German fighters and bombers fill the English skies and the RAF respond Now you command the RAF or the Luftwaffe in history_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest air campaign - the Battle of Britain. Improving on his award winning solitaire classic, designer John Butterfield ramps up the historical accuracy, tension and play options with three complete games. RAF: Lion puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to German raids. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unique card system generates targets and forces, which may remain hidden until after you commit your squadrons. Your foe is no mindless system: the Luftwaffe has priorities and a strategy. Scenarios range from one raid day, taking an hour to complete, to the full campaign, playable in 12 hours.</notes>

All counters are unclipped and have been carefully cut out from the die-cut sprue with a craft knife.  This will save you a few hours over a new copy as Decision Games die-cutting is pretty rubbish!
Comes with some extra copies of charts (this edition missed out charts in some boxes and put extras in others).</notes>

My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He loved his games and took excellent care of them!  If they were played, we no food or drink was allowed.  Smoke free environment...   He passed away in 2012 and it is time for the games to find new homes.  Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>This is an engaging solitaire game. You can either play as the Luftwaffe commander or the RAF commander. There is even a 2 player version so it is actually 3 games in one. I found the Eagle version the most challenging as Luftwaffe commander. It gives you the scope to decide on raid targets and time of day as well as the number of aircraft for each raid, all within some realistic restrictions. The RAF fighter defence is a tough nut to crack. Typically they know you are coming and can mass squadrons accordingly. They also get their fighters down and refuelled and rearmed within 2 to 4 hours. You must be clever and creative with your raid strategy. For example you might send in a small well escorted raid to an airfield to draw the enemy fighters and then follow up with a devastating much larger raid to catch them on the ground. You have to decide whether to allocate your Me 109 fighters to hunt in large groups for enemy fighters or keep them close to protect the vulnerable bombers. As the Luftwaffe you cannot afford heavy losses and yet you must engage the RAF in big aerial battles to defeat them. Time is also against you with Operation SeaLion looming in mid September. In contrast as the RAF player you have to deal with dwindling numbers of experienced pilots. You typically have plenty of replacement aircraft but green pilots are very vulnerable in battle. The game is in great condition. I have included a GMT counter tray and some extra photocopies of some of the charts for convenience.</notes>
