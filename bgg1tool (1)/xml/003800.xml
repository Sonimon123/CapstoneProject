   <description>As the Chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe; Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa, or Tamang, you lead your yak's caravan from one village to another through snowy crests and risky paths in order to collect the goods necessary to the development of your tribe._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Meanwhile, you will increase the political, religious and economical influence of your tribe. By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I accept money order and paypal. I only accept existing paypal balance or draft from checking through paypal, unless your trade rating is above 20 on the geek. Then I will also accept credit card draft.   
Shipping is exact shipping to your location via Fedex ground. This means it will not be more than 10.00 dollars (very likely less) and will be much cheaper if you have it sent to a business.
Shipping to Canada will be USPS priority or first class mail.
I do not ship to other countries.</notes>

This is the French version (rules in french, german, italian),  but I can include the english rules available here on the geek,  plus 4 laminated player aids showing the alternative scoring system (which I greatly recommend).

NOTE: I would prefer to sell the game and the expansion together. The expansion is listed and priced separately, but under the assumption that they will be bought as a pair. If you want to buy just one let me know before ordering.
Both have been punched but not played, so all the components are in excellent condition. The base game box has minor wear. Everything stores neatly in the base game box, but I can include the expansion box as well if desired (it might increase the shipping cost). It is in good shape, but if there was an insert for it, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gone.
The base game does not include English rules (it has French, German, and Italian), but they are available on the game page. The expansion does include English rules.</notes>

    <notes>The shrink has been opened but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about it. The plastic figures are still on the sprues, the screens are still their enclosure, and the cardboard tokens still unpunched (a few have come off but most are still in place).
In short a never played, pristine game. The shrink is still in place around the box cover.
Within the US, I ship via Fedex, with insurance and tracking (shipping to an office location should cost around $11). Outside the US, I will ship via USPS, probably the easiest to use. I will charge the exact amount I pay for shipping, no extras.
Check out my other games for sale. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping.

This version does not have the english rules, but I have printed them up and included them. Played a couple times. In great condition. 
Also in the box, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included the 5-6 player expansion components. 
I still may have the box, I just need to look for it. The expansion came with english rules.
