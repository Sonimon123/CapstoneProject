   <description>From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;C: Ancients, and Memoir' 44):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Middle Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill Games, Inc., Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve already done the tedious job of putting the stickers on the blocks; PLUS, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve packed the blocks into a nifty plastic organizer.

    <notes>Game is open, but new and in perfect condition.
Better than buying new in shrink.  Why?!!!  The stickers have been painstakingly applied to blocks with tweezers.  They are just about as perfect as you can get...seriously.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to see picture proof let me know (GeekMail) and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send you pictures of the lot.  All other components are in perfect condition.
Shipping in the US lower 48 is $10 via USPS Priority Mail.  If desired I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship via your courier of choice for actually cost.
All other locations are welcome to purchase, but shipping will be billed at actual cost (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m taking a bit of a hit on domestic shipping, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do that for international).
Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This includes the first two expansions: Greece _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Eastern Kingdoms and Rome _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Barbarians. 
Everything is bagged and organized by expansion and original game. EVERYTHING IS ALREADY STICKERED (It was meticulously done to near perfection). These are open and play items and one of the expansions includes the mounted board.
All components, cards, tiles, instructions and box are in near mint condition.
I will be shipping USPS. Please check my Trade and Market Rating for reliability.

    <notes>New in Shrinkwrap (but the wrap is starting to come off).
Will ship overseas with Priority Mail International or Fedex or UPS at your discretion, but once I deliver it to the shipper, I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be responsible for it.
Happy to combine shipping to save you money.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not a store and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for a living. I will get it to the Post Office as quckly as time permits and I am trying to perfect this automated shipping system to facilitate things, but overseas orders remain problematic. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m working on it ...
Make Paypal payments to Warhawkeye@aol.com, NOT Misterhawk@aol.com
Thanks for looking ...

    <notes>Punched (or rather stickered!) and played a couple of scenarios only. Both the box and all components are in excellent condition and everything is present. Not really my thing - more of a Berg than a Borg fan! This is just the base game, 2nd edition, none of the expansion packs are included. There are still some stickers and blocks that have not been used and are in the box. I live in the Stockport area of Greater Manchester and can deliver/arrange collection in person in that area. Otherwise please contact me for a postage quote - the game is heavier than most at around 2.2 kilos when packed, so I will only ship this game within the UK as postage costs for over 2 kilos are MUCH more expensive when shipping overseas.</notes>

Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients allows you to re-fight epic battles of the ancient world. Here the focus is on the two rivals for power in the Western Mediterranean – Carthage and Rome. Will you, as Hannibal, triumph over larger Roman armies; or as Scipio Africanus, will you beat Hannibal with newer tactics of your own?
Units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered. The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory.
Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients contains the battles of Akragas, Crimissos River, Ticinus River, Lake Trasimenus, Cannae, Dertosa, Castulo, Baecula, Ilipa, and Zama.

Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients allows you to re-fight epic battles of the ancient world. Here the focus is on the two rivals for power in the Western Mediterranean – Carthage and Rome. Will you, as Hannibal, triumph over larger Roman armies; or as Scipio Africanus, will you beat Hannibal with newer tactics of your own?
Units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered. The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory.
Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients contains the battles of Akragas, Crimissos River, Ticinus River, Lake Trasimenus, Cannae, Dertosa, Castulo, Baecula, Ilipa, and Zama.

    <notes>Hello, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my copy of Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it once, my wife did not enjoy it as much as Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44, but I have to admit it is a great game. Stickers were applied, but everything is like new.</notes>

Commands and Colors: Ancients allows you to re-fight epic battles of the ancient world. Here the focus is on the two rivals for power in the Western Mediterranean -- Carthage and Rome. Will you as Hannibal triumph over larger Roman armies; or as Scipio Africanus will you beat Hannibal with newer tactics of your own? Units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered. The command playing cards supply those orders providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units their weapons and the terrain will determine victory. Commands and Colors: Ancients contains the battles of Akragas Crimissos River Ticinus River Lake Trasimenus Cannae Dertosa Castulo Baecula Ilipa and Zama. The third printing has no component changes but does have updated rules. </notes>

Payment may be made by Paypal or bank transfer in advance.
For orders above €50 we grant a discount of €5 on shipping costs.
If you have any questions, feel free to send us an email (laden@gamers-hq.de), give us a call (+49 30 79706126) or visit our homepage (www.gamers-hq.de).
Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

This is an awesome set that includes the base game and 1st 3 expansions, all mint condition, all stickered, and all cards sleeved.  Believe me, you will LOVE the fact you do not have to sticker the components!  This is an incredible deal that will go quickly!  Includes mounted board.  This set has been meticulously cared for, and each army is neatly separated into large baggies and labeled. Also includes Ancients Epic map and scenarios.  All boxes and rulesets are included and in new condition.  
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. Expect $20-30 shipping with the 4 fairly large boxes.  
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of GMT war games and other classic boardgames. </notes>

    <notes>This is a big lot, it will probably cost a good bit to ship.  
Includes
Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors Ancients, Base Game
Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors Ancients, Exp 1
Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors Ancients, Exp 2
Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors Ancients, Exp 3
The base game and expansion 1 have been stickered and divided out into Plano boxes separating all the units.  The other expansion I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t believe have been stickered yet and if they have, they are just in zip locks.  
This also includes 4 sets of Valley Games Wooden Dice as well.  
Also includes an updated Second Edition Deck of Cards still in shrink.  I fixed the Original game cards with sharpie and just used those.  But you have the second edition there too brand new as well.  Technically, with all the extra dice and units, you could probably use the second deck of cards to play two games at once.
Buyer prepays plus shipping.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be actual shipping charges.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been played only once. Stickers have already been placed on cubes, but all pieces, cards, and boards are in immaculate condition. Can send additional photos prior to making any decisions.  
Shipping to Canadian addresses will cost an additional $25.00 on top of the charge of the game itself.
If you are purchasing this game and live outside of Canada, please contact me prior to purchasing the game for a shipping quote. Note, this game is heavy, so shipping can get quite pricey the further from Canada you are located. 
If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to message me and ask prior to purchasing!</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Like New condition for box and bits. The contents are complete (including extra blocks). The stickers have been placed carefully on the blocks.  Never played.
The sheets have spare stickers on them.  Before I realized it, I placed some of the designated spares on the blocks.  However, this just means that the places I should_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve taken the stickers from now contain the spares.  All of the stickers were correctly placed.</notes>

    <notes>This lot includes:
1) Base game -- stickers applied. Cards sleeved. One additional set of Valley Games wood dice.
2) Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #1 – Greece _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Eastern Kingdoms (First edition) -- stickers applied.
3) Commands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Colors: Ancients Expansions #2 and #3 – Rome vs the Barbarians; The Roman Civil Wars (First edition) (2014) -- stickers not yet applied (fun for you!)
All three boxes are clean other than minor shelf wear.  I prefer to be conservative regarding condition, so I marked the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but in my opinion, the contents are closer to Like New.
Shipping to U.S. only. Prefer USPS Priority, but can discuss other option. Local pickup possible in the vicinity of New Paltz, NY. (If you want to save a bit on shipping, and are not a stickler for boxes, we MIGHT be able to save a bit by condensing everything to two boxes rather than three.)</notes>
