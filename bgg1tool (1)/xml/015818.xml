   <description>Two to seven players, ages 8 and up try to obtain fried worms for their chickens, so that they don't go hungry. Of course, anyone who doesn't manage to grab a worm off of the grill can help himself to those of his opponents. This fast-paced game by Reiner Knizia is, like Hick Hack im Gackelwack, a gambling game in the finest chicken tradition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn players roll their dice and set aside all those matching any single value. The remaining dice are rolled and any value is set aside again until the player stops and takes a tile or busts and puts their last tile back. When a player busts and fails to take a tile they must also turn the highest tile face-down._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Interestingly, the German edition from Zoch has English rules in the box._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Dutch edition is part of the Jakkie _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Bak Collection_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The German edition is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Game Description: Roasted worms are a bird’s delight. On one hand this is due to the fact that worms are the favourite dish of all poultry. On the other hand, the preference for barbecue worms is nobody else’s doing but of Johnny Rooster Roaster. His Uncle Sam, a native from Chickentown Kentucky, had the idea to open up a worm roasting house at each corner of town. Johnny didn’t hesitate to make this idea a reality and since their first days as worm-barbecue masters their roasting joints have found no lack of eager and famished customers. And the customers keep coming. All over the place, chicken folk have started to gather worms and supply them to Johnny. Whether Curry Worm, Roast’n Worm or Frankfurter Worm: poultry of all sorts are standing in line to taste one of these specialties. For Johnny and his new found business the following stands: from worm hunter to millionaire!

The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and in great condition.
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately. 
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost. I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.
Thank you</notes>

    <notes>Never played. The tiles are still sealed. Got this from a games research convention (DiGRA) that had Knizia as a keynote speaker. He gave these out for conference attendees. The text on the box is not in English (and the game is called Heckmeck), but the English rules are included, as is a flyer with Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bio. :)</notes>

    <notes>Heckmeck is a brilliantly simple yet fiendish game. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s played with chunky tiles – not unlike Mah Jongg or Dominoes – that players collect according to what they can roll on the dice. Unless they go bust and lose a tile! I have the multi-lingual edition from the German publisher.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £8.33 (net of UK tax - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country).
I charge shipping at cost and I can offer several options (or ask me to get a quote from couriers).
To UK addresses:
myHermes (2-3 working days, tracked) £2.98
Second class post (2-3 working days) £3.36
First class post (1 working day) £6.85
To other EU countries:
Air mail (1 week or so) £8.22
Outside the EU:

    <notes>Heckmeck is a brilliantly simple yet fiendish game. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s played with chunky tiles – not unlike Mah Jongg or Dominoes – that players collect according to what they can roll on the dice. Unless they go bust and lose a tile! I have the multi-lingual edition from the German publisher.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £7.50 (net of UK tax - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country).
