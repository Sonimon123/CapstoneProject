   <description>Cthulhu Wars is a strategy boardgame in which the players take the part of alien races and gods taken from the Cthulhu mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft. The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four  figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. All factions have multiple strategies open to them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The base game supports 2-4 players (the map supports 5 players), but with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to 8 players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for a De Vermiis Mysteriis (DVM) pledge of Cthulhu Wars including a couple of extras:
- Canadian shipping ($20 during the Kickstarter campaign)*
- 11x17 signed art print.
*The above shipping option means that shipping is FREE if you are in the US or Canada.
The DVM package includes almost too much to mention (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll leave something out)!
The DVM package includes all gameplay items: 
- Full base game, 
- Asenath Waite player marker
- H.P. Lovecraft player marker
- 20 Custom dice
- 22 Upgraded miniature gates
- The Opener of the Way expansion (Yog Sothoth)
- Azathoth _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;neutral_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; faction expansion
- Windwalker faction expansion (Ithaqua)
- Sleeper faction expansion (Tsathoggua)
- The High Priest expansion
- Dreamlands Underworld Expansion Pack
- Dreamlands Surface Expansion Pack
- Primeval Map Expansion
- Yuggoth Map Expansion
- 6-8 player map
- 10 extra Great Old Ones (including Gobodeg, Sandy Petersen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Original GOO)
- 34 Collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition figures
Very important note: the game is still in the manufacturing step.  I do not have it in my possession.  No one has this game yet.  
Send me your email address and once payment is verified, I will update the Fundafull site with your email so that you can take over the pledge.  You can put in your address and request for the account to be unlocked if you want to make changes to the pledge details.</notes>

    <notes>Petersen Games (PETCTHU01)
Cthulhu Wars is a strategy board game in which the players take the part of alien races and gods taken from the Cthulhu mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft. The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm. The game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books. Driving the strategy are a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. All factions have multiple strategies open to them.</notes>

Product Description
The Old Ones have risen. Monsters walk the Earth. Humanity is finished but the struggle continues. Which Great Old One will rule the ruins of Earth? Now, you take charge!
Cthulhu Wars is a fast-moving strategy game about the end of the world. You take part of various monstrous aliens seeking to dominate the world. You can play as Great Cthulhu himself, or you can take charge of the other factions, such as the slither hordes of the Crawling Chaos, or the insane minions of the Yellow Sign.</notes>

    <notes>*** CTHULHU WARS + MANY UPGRADES ***
* Upgraded Gates
* Upgraded Dice
* Upgraded Faction Cards
* Upgraded First Player Marker
Items included in this listing are the base game and the upgrades listed above.  NONE Of the Expansions or Great Old One packs are included in this listing.
Complete Cthulhu Wars Base game with original packaging PLUS additional 3D Gates and Custom attack dice.
This is one of the originally shipped Cthulhu Wars games.  I was a backer of the game at the Cultes Des Goules level and got the base game with the following:
* Base Cthulhu Wars game with 4 factions (Great Cthulhu (green), Black Goat (red), Crawling Chaos (blue), Yellow Sign (yellow)), rules book regular dice
* Kickstarter Exclusive 1st Player Marker (grey, lower left, next to Great Cthulhu)
* 22 Upgraded plastic gates (grey, shown on board)
* 20 Custom Cthulhu Wars Dice (bottom center of the board)
* Upgraded Player Faction Cards (nice thick cardstock vs the thinner original ones, note thickness in image))
MSRP $296
NOTE:  See included picture to see ALL products.  The images has the base game and all of the expansions shown.  The one thing NOT shown in the image is the base game Maps.  They are about 6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; smaller per board than the two shown.  The image is more than is included in this listing.</notes>

    <notes>This is a very large set weighing more than 23 kgs! It will require shipping in 2 boxes.
Cthulhu Wars Base Game - This has been opened and played 2 times (possibly more depending on how long it takes to sell...). 2 (3?) minor character miniatures were broken/damaged during the initial shipping to me. They are easily repairable but you can probably get a free replacement directly from Petersen Games if you ask them for it. All other components in this set are new and not played.
Opener of the Way Expansion (opened, checked, not played)
The Sleeper Faction Expansion  (opened, checked, not played)
Windwalker Faction Expansion  (opened, checked, not played but 1 corner of box was slightly crushed in initial shipping.)
Azathoth Faction Expansion  (opened, checked, not played)
6-8 Player Map Expansion  (opened, checked, not played)
Die Cut Faction Cards  (opened, checked, not played)

    <notes>This is for the Kickstarter Edition including a big bundle of additional player factions, Great Old One expansion packs, two additional maps, molded gates and custom dice, first player marker and the High Priest expansion. 
The entire bundle costs over 580€ even without the Kickstarter extras. Please contact me if you have further questions.
Due to the size and weight, pick up in Brussels is preferred. Alternatively, shipping can be arranged at extra costs (ca. 50€).
In addition, you may add the new faction, map, Great Old Ones Pack, plastic marker upgrade and all stretch goals from the CW Onslaught 2 campaign to your game for 180€. I am basically selling my pledge that would be delivered to you directly.
Payment via Paypal or COD. Will also accept European bank transfer.</notes>
