   <description>Blokus Trigon is an abstract strategy game from the makers of Blokus. The board pieces have changed from square to triangular. Game play is similar to Blokus, as players try to get rid of all their pieces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There is a solitaire version where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hexagonal playing board with 486 triangles on the board_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;4 sets of 22 pieces in red, blue, green and yellow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     1 piece made up of one triangle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     1 piece made up of two triangles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     1 piece made up of three triangles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     3 pieces made up of four triangles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     4 pieces made up of five triangles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     12 pieces made up of six triangles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Set up:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Layout your hexagonal silver board and give each player a set of 22 pieces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Play:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player begins at one of the marked spaces on the board.

    <notes>BRAND NEW FROM PUBLISHER IN SHRINKWRAP!
$10.95 shipping in USA.
I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
Optional insurance $1.35.
Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica, MA, USA.
International orders, please ask about shipping costs before ordering.
PayPal or checks accepted.
Thanks for your order. Your game is ready to ship!

    <notes>Educational Insights (EIS 2970)
Blokus Trigon is an abstract strategy game from the makers of Blokus. The board pieces have changed from square to triagonal. Game play is similar to Blokus, as players try to get rid of all their pieces. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one of your pieces already on the board at a corner.
There is a solitaire version where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.</notes>

    <notes>Very good condition, complete copy. Does not have the original rules. They are available on the web (see below link) or I can print them out in color for the buyer.
I have access to reduced shipping rates at work, so please ask for a shipping quote (provide your ZIP code!). The rates I get are close to 50% off normal UPS Ground rates. Figure this_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll run about 4lbs shipped weight as I always take care to pack these well. Shipping is from ZIP 10589.
If you buy multiple titles from me I take $1 off your total order for every game after the first one. And I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course combine shipping.
Local pickup at ZIP 10589 or 06804 is OK too. In that case, please plan to pay in cash when picking up. Otherwise, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s PayPal.
