    <notes>Hi, this is for a copy of Battle of the Five Armies.  The game itself is unplayed and all the counters are unpunched, the cards are still sealed etc.  The box however has a slight dent on the right hand corner.  As said, everything is unused, i have literally just taken off the cellophane to check that the contents are not damaged.
Shipping Via Myhermes (about a fiver i reckon, any more and i will cover it myself), UK ONLY PLEASE.
PHOTOS CAN BE PROVIDED IF REQUESTED, THANKS FOR LOOKING!</notes>

    <notes>Ares Games (AREWOTR010)
The fierce struggle, witnessed by Bilbo Baggins at the end of his quest, is about to begin! The stalwart warriors of the Free Peoples; Elves, Dwarves and Men, formed an uneasy alliance to defend the Lonely Mountain and the treasure of Smaug. Now, they are facing the endless horde of minions of the Necromancer. The Shadow Armies, led by Bolg, son of Azog, are going to sweep the ruins of Dale and the Front Gate with an unstoppable onslaught. Will the Goblins come through the mountain soon enough to overwhelm the Free Peoples with a two-pronged attack? Can the arrival of Beorn, the skin-changer, turn the tide in favor of the Free Peoples? Will the coming of the Eagles stop the Goblins from crossing the mountain? The Battle of Five Armies is a two-players game that allows you to re-create the epic conclusion of The Hobbit, the world-renowned masterpiece by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Shadow player commands the armies of Bolg, son of Azog, the King of the Goblins of Mount Gundabad, while the Free Peoples player is in control of Men, Dwarves and Elves, led by Gandalf to fend off the goblin army. Based on the acclaimed mechanics first used in the War of the Ring board game, The Battle of Five Armies merges action dice and event cards, to make each game a unique experience. The system has been further enhanced by the addition of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fate Track_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mechanic, handling the arrival of the allies and the triggering of special events. All the key characters in the battle; Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Dain, the Elven King, Bard, Beorn, Bolg, are featured with powerful special abilities and unique sculptures.</notes>

    <notes>Ares Games (AREWOTR010)
The fierce struggle, witnessed by Bilbo Baggins at the end of his quest, is about to begin! The stalwart warriors of the Free Peoples; Elves, Dwarves and Men, formed an uneasy alliance to defend the Lonely Mountain and the treasure of Smaug. Now, they are facing the endless horde of minions of the Necromancer. The Shadow Armies, led by Bolg, son of Azog, are going to sweep the ruins of Dale and the Front Gate with an unstoppable onslaught. Will the Goblins come through the mountain soon enough to overwhelm the Free Peoples with a two-pronged attack? Can the arrival of Beorn, the skin-changer, turn the tide in favor of the Free Peoples? Will the coming of the Eagles stop the Goblins from crossing the mountain? The Battle of Five Armies is a two-players game that allows you to re-create the epic conclusion of The Hobbit, the world-renowned masterpiece by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Shadow player commands the armies of Bolg, son of Azog, the King of the Goblins of Mount Gundabad, while the Free Peoples player is in control of Men, Dwarves and Elves, led by Gandalf to fend off the goblin army. Based on the acclaimed mechanics first used in the War of the Ring board game, The Battle of Five Armies merges action dice and event cards, to make each game a unique experience. The system has been further enhanced by the addition of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fate Track_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mechanic, handling the arrival of the allies and the triggering of special events. All the key characters in the battle; Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Dain, the Elven King, Bard, Beorn, Bolg, are featured with powerful special abilities and unique sculptures.</notes>

    <notes>ARES GAMES (AREWOTR010)
The fierce struggle, witnessed by Bilbo Baggins at the end of his quest, is about to begin! The stalwart warriors of the Free Peoples; Elves, Dwarves and Men, formed an uneasy alliance to defend the Lonely Mountain and the treasure of Smaug. Now, they are facing the endless horde of minions of the Necromancer. The Shadow Armies, led by Bolg, son of Azog, are going to sweep the ruins of Dale and the Front Gate with an unstoppable onslaught. Will the Goblins come through the mountain soon enough to overwhelm the Free Peoples with a two-pronged attack? Can the arrival of Beorn, the skin-changer, turn the tide in favor of the Free Peoples? Will the coming of the Eagles stop the Goblins from crossing the mountain? The Battle of Five Armies is a two-players game that allows you to re-create the epic conclusion of The Hobbit, the world-renowned masterpiece by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Shadow player commands the armies of Bolg, son of Azog, the King of the Goblins of Mount Gundabad, while the Free Peoples player is in control of Men, Dwarves and Elves, led by Gandalf to fend off the goblin army. Based on the acclaimed mechanics first used in the War of the Ring board game, The Battle of Five Armies merges action dice and event cards, to make each game a unique experience. The system has been further enhanced by the addition of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fate Track_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mechanic, handling the arrival of the allies and the triggering of special events. All the key characters in the battle; Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Dain, the Elven King, Bard, Beorn, Bolg, are featured with powerful special abilities and unique sculptures.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game has only been played twice.  All components are in excellent condition.  The box top had some minor damage (this was a ding and dent item) along the seam.  This has been glued and is not that noticeable unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking.
ALL CARDS HAVE BEEN SLEEVED, including the larger character cards.  
This box is large and heavy, so feel free to ask for a shipping quote before purchasing.  I will ship the cheapest and safest option, usually USPS Priority, unless shipping to the west coast, in which case sometimes Fed Ex or UPS is cheaper.</notes>

    <notes>The game is punched but unplayed. The box has some damage, thus the very good rating, it is like new otherwise.
PayPal friends and family option preferred for payment to avoid PayPal fees.
I ship quickly after payment is made, usually next day. I use USPS priority mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is less expensive. I round up to the full dollar amount. International shipping from the US is very expensive so please ask for a quote or do your own research on the approximate cost before you add this to your cart. 
Ask if you have any questions. Thanks!</notes>
