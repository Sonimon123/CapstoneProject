   <description>Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.  Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the designer:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Eagle Games 2004 version.  Game is new and in shrink wrap; the shrink wrap has a small tear in one place.  
I will ship to Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.. Buyer pays actual shipping costs, based on his/her preferred method of shipping. I will confirm shipping cost once I know the address and preferred method of shipping.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple items into a single order - please see my other games for sale. Optional insurance paid by buyer, highly recommended. FREE delivery confirmation! 
Currently, I can only accept payment by cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check, money order, or NON-credit card Paypal transfer.
Thanks for looking!

Warfrog (made in Germany) edition, not Eagle (made in China). I can tell the difference, can you?
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>2005 Eagle Games version.  Played once.  Box has a couple of minor dings on the corners.  Game appears to be complete- I counted the components and there are more pieces than specified in the rules!  (So I think the component list in the rules is incorrect.)
You pay all shipping charges. For domestic shipping, this game can be shipped inside a medium Priority Mail flat rate box for $11.00. This method also does not include insurance, which can be added for $1.75. I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged shipments if you do not purchase insurance. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship by another method if you prefer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping for multiple items. Use zip code 98104 to calculate shipping costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to arrange for local pickup in the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia area.
I will ship anywhere, by your choice of carrier, however there is a $10 surcharge per international shipments above the cost of shipping to compensate me for the additional time involved in shipping internationally. Note that this is per shipment, so if you buy several games from me and have them shipped together, you just pay once. Sorry to have to do this, but international shipments are much more time consuming for me than domestic shipments.
Payment by PayPal only, except for local pickup which must be paid in cash. Sorry, no checks or money orders. I will ship within 3 days of receipt of payment.</notes>

    <notes>Bought on BGG Marketplace. I punched the game, read the rules, but never got chance to play it. I now have to make some space in the house for baby things, so the really heavy games that I want to play but never get the opportunity have to go. Will ship to the UK. Postage is extra.
P.S. This is the 2005 Eagle Games edition.</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games (EGL101015N)
Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s allied, he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.</notes>

It is punched and bagged, but in great shape, just a little shelf wear. Buyer pays actual shipping, but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry--if we calculate the shipping and it is too high, we can cancel the order.</notes>

Game comes from a smoke free / climate controlled home.
I charge actual shipping rates, from zip code 13057.
I will combine shipping from other items.</notes>

    <notes>For Paladin82Y only
Please read full description before purchasing, this is a partial copy of the game:
Bought used, was looking at playing this a while back, but when I inventoried it, I found that it was missing all player pieces for 2 of the 7 players (Black and Red) and missing all the unrest/country counters as well. Selling this _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;as is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and for parts more that anything else. Board in very good condition (dice and money are still sealed so the game itself might be unplayed), box has some dishing and shelf wear. Multilingual second edition (2005) Eagle-Gryphon Games, Warfrog Games
