Essentially a game of 'kill stealing'. Each round, any monster encountered will have a prestige value of 1 through 6.  The player that successfully jockeys for position and lands the killing blow gets the prestige value for the encounter.  Some encounters will not have a specific monster, such as a trap room for the heroes to pass through (and in this case, earning no prestige).  The surviving player with the most prestige after the 9 encounters is the winner.  If the players do not survive all 9 encounters, no one wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A unique combination of cooperative game play and opportunistic backstabbing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Smirk _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dagger Games (S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D 0040)
Genre-bending. Dice-less.
The totally immersive feel of a RPG in a simple, elegant card game.
A perfect balance of cooperative gameplay and back-stabbing goodness. 
An artifact of untold power lies in your hands. To claim it, you must escape the caverns alive. No less than nine horrific beasts stand in your way - that, and the greed of the other players.
In this game of kill-stealing, you decide whether to swing for a whopping 50 points of damage - or hold back, awaiting a more opportune time to strike. Only the final blow matters if you are to score the kill. Hold back or sabotage other’s plans too much - and the entire party will die, without a winner.
Okay, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what it says on the box... what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it really like?
Cutthroat Caverns is truly unique. While most definitely a highly interactive card game and very easy to play, it requires the strategic thinking of a board game. And, for some uncanny reason, the game will make you FEEL like you are in the middle of a classic dungeon crawl, even though table talk is about as much roleplaying as you are likely to do. That all said, it has proven to have a very broad appeal with gamers across several genres.
The real joy is the delicate balance between helping the party (and staying alive) vs working towards your own selfish goals (and risking the welfare of everyone). There are no dice. Each Turn, you will choose how much damage you are willing to do to the monster- or won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do - as you jockey for position to land the killing blow. And when characters can make that kind of decision, things get very funny _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; very deadly - very quickly.
With 25 encounters, all requiring a different group strategy and seperate individual strategy, game play is always challenging. Only 9 random encounters are used in any game, so the experience is always different. With fresh new mechanics built into each expansion and a creature pool now 75 strong - there is always a new adventure ahead. And they become deadlier as we go.

    <notes>Smirk _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dagger Games (S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D0040)
Genre-bending. Dice-less. The totally immersive feel of a RPG in a simple, elegant card game. A perfect balance of cooperative gameplay and back-stabbing goodness. An artifact of untold power lies in your hands. To claim it, you must escape the caverns alive. No less than nine horrific beasts stand in your way - that, and the greed of the other players. In this game of kill-stealing, you decide whether to swing for a whopping 50 points of damage - or hold back, awaiting a more opportune time to strike. Only the final blow matters if you are to score the kill. Hold back or sabotage other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s plans too much - and the entire party will die, without a winner. Okay, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what it says on the box... what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it really like? Cutthroat Caverns is truly unique. While most definitely a highly interactive card game and very easy to play, it requires the strategic thinking of a board game. And, for some uncanny reason, the game will make you FEEL like you are in the middle of a classic dungeon crawl, even though table talk is about as much roleplaying as you are likely to do. That all said, it has proven to have a very broad appeal with gamers across several genres. The real joy is the delicate balance between helping the party (and staying alive) vs working towards your own selfish goals (and risking the welfare of everyone). There are no dice. Each Turn, you will choose how much damage you are willing to do to the monster- or won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do - as you jockey for position to land the killing blow. And when characters can make that kind of decision, things get very funny _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; very deadly - very quickly. With 25 encounters, all requiring a different group strategy and seperate individual strategy, game play is always challenging. Only 9 random encounters are used in any game, so the experience is always different. With fresh new mechanics built into each expansion and a creature pool now 75 strong - there is always a new adventure ahead. And they become deadlier as we go. </notes>

    <notes>The complete Cutthroat Caverns collection! Everything is stored in the Fresh Meat box, but I do have a few of the expansion boxes if you want them.

Includes all of the following (I will not separate):
Cutthroat Caverns: Fresh Meat 
Cutthroat Caverns: Deeper _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Darker 
Cutthroat Caverns: Relics _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Ruin 
Cutthroat Caverns: Tombs _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Tomes 
Cutthroat Caverns Adventures: B1 – Savage Arena / B2 – Errand of Evil 
Cutthroat Caverns: Hex Room Promo Card
