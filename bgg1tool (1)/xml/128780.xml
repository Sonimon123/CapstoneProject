Each turn goes as follows:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1. Action Phase: Perform three actions, such as play new cards, get new cards from the market, speculate on cards in the market, buy land, or redeploy troops._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2. Discard Headlines: Remove any Headlines (i.e. cards with the Bull-Bear icon) that have reached the leftmost position in the Market._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3. Restore Market: Restore the Market to twelve cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;4. Income Phase: Collect one gold per Income, Extortion, and Connection Cube in play. If Depression, pay one gold for each card in play (includes Partners and Enterprises in your Row, and all of your Troops)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;scoring_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards (Toppling) are in the game and their effect depends on the current form of government. The government can change if troops are played and as a result of other cards. The form of government also influences different production values of the game, such as how much mines produce. Players win by toppling D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;iacute;az, either by coup, succession, revolution, or annexation of Mexico by the U.S. If D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;iacute;az remains firmly seated at the end of the game, then the player with the most gold wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Pax Porfiriana includes 220 cards, but only fifty cards (along with ten for each player) are used in a game, so no two games will be the same!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Sierra Madre Games (SRM32)
Pax Porfiriana is Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Porfirian Peace_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. It refers to the 33-year reign of dictator Porfirio Díaz, ruling Mexico with an iron hand until toppled by the 1910 Revolution. As a rich businessman (Hacendado) in the turbulent pre-revolutionary borderlands of the U.S. and Mexico, compete to build business empires of ranches, mines, rails, troops, and banks while subverting your opponents with bandidos, Indians, and lawsuits. Win by toppling Díaz, either by coup, succession, revolution, or annexing Mexico to the U.S. If Díaz remains firmly seated at the end of the game, then the player with the most gold is the winner. </notes>

    <notes>This is opened but sadly unplayed, and in outstanding condition. If you browse the image files for the game you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see one with a custom cigar box, custom coins, and custom card mats. That is what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling, and it comes with all that stuff plus the original box.
Sorry to see this go, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it will ever hit the table. Hope someone gets some enjoyment out of it!</notes>

Did not come with rule booklet, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d probably want to print the latest version from the web anyways!
I *can* ship in a flat-rate envelope for $6 (US only), but that will offer zero protection for the game box. Otherwise, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship at cost from 92037.

I usually get the package in the post the day after purchase. I must emphasise that I take extra care to package in a sturdy box with packing protection, however I accept no responsibility for the package once it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the hands of Auspost. If you have a wild postal contractor who likes to hurl boxes AFL style at your front door then please let me know to organise signature on delivery. (Likewise if you live in a building where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not prepared to take the risk of Auspost leaving a parcel at the front door.) No refunds for damage or loss in transit. All parcels come with a tracking number. If you require extra insurance then let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll arrange it.
Local pickup in St Ives is available.</notes>

    <notes>Initially a fan project to produce a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;bigger_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; version of the game, it was adopted by original publisher Sierra Madre as the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s second edition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still an intense struggle to end up on top in the turbulent times of the Mexican revolution. Viva Zapata!

    <notes>Played once, great condition.  Payment is preferred in gift certificate to Amazon or Coolstuffinc, or money transfer to email using a system that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t collect a fee.  Bank of America has a send to email address feature that works for this purpose for example.  Paypal does as well, but their terms and conditions prohibit me from offering it as a payment source and requiring the use send money to family and friends feature, which avoids fees.  Buyer pays shipping.  I will default to shipping via UPS but am able to ship via Fed Ex if preferred.  This is a small box, so shopping is probably fairly low.</notes>

    <notes>The original, compact box format.  Tremendous gaming richness in a small package.  Ideal for gaming on the go, when storage is tight and for those who appreciate the aesthetics of optimal packaging delivering unexpected depth, replay value and sheer fun.
The shrink is removed, but otherwise the contents are in original packaging.  This is a second copy I bought after I found how much I liked the game and hoped to gift it to a family member who would also like it.  They aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t gamers, though, so time to sell.  Everything is in brand new condition, with just the shrink wrap removed.
Will ship via USPS, FedEd or UPS, you choose.  Shipping charges will be for actual cost of shipping.  I am located in the Dallas, Texas area.</notes>
