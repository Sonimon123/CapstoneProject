   <description>Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football.  The basic game features a match between a human team and an orc team.  Ostensibly the teams are playing football.  In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field.  The game comes with plastic miniatures._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the 3rd edition. The box-top has a tear in two corners along with other wear and tear (Games Workshop didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make their boxes too well, did they:). The rules are missing (I have print out versions of the living rulebooks in-box). The scatter template is missing, but easily replaced by choosing a square to represent 1 on the scatter directions. One human lineman has been broken at the feet. Both pieces of the lineman are still in-box and could be repaired. The original retailer list and painting guide from when the game was printed (late 1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s or early _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;90s?) are inside.
All miniatures are unpainted and unprimed. I will charge only actual shipping costs (Box, Materials, USPS priority mail w/delivery confirmation). The price is fairly negotiable, or I am willing to trade.</notes>

    <notes>Blood Bowl (3rd Ed.) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Death Zone expansion w/ extras
(Note: I will list this under both Blood Bowl and Death Zone.  When I get an offer, I will cancel one of the two sales.  Apologies if you are the second to respond and do not get the games.)
This is a used copy of both items.  Box condition is therefore “acceptable” at best, but components are in better condition than “acceptable” describes.  I did not keep the Death Zone box: the board, books, cards, and such are in the Blood Bowl box, and the minis are in one homemade, foam-lined storage box and one plastic, foam-lined pistol case.
Complete components from both games are present, with the exception of the decal sheets for the Orc and Human teams.
Extras:
* The Citadel Journal Blood Bowl Compendium (1998)
* 4th Ed. Rules (unofficial print-outs – these may still be available elsewhere on the web, so if you don’t want to pay shipping for them, I’ll leave them out)
* Above-average paint jobs (not ‘Eavy Metal, but neat, with some advanced techniques used) on the plastic minis and two of the four balls included in the Blood Bowl game.  Bases flocked, number decals applied.  (Humans in Altdorf blue, red, and yellow, Orcs in Black with Gold trim.)
* 1 extra plastic Human Blitzer mini, painted, flocked and decaled to the same standard.
* 2 metal Orc Blitzer minis, painted, flocked and decaled to the same standard.
* 2 metal Orc Black Orc minis, painted, flocked and decaled to the same standard.
* 1 metal Mighty Zug Human Star Player mini, primed and partially painted.
* 3 metal Goblin minis, primed and partially painted.
* 2 extra plastic Human Lineman minis and 1 extra Human Catcher mini, primed and partially painted.
* 1 metal Cheerleader mini (either Human or Elf, suitable for Human team), primed but not painted.
Optional extras at additional cost:
* Human sideline team: 2 Imperial gun crew minis (primed but not painted) suitable for use as coach and assistant coach, a very nicely painted Imperial Celestial Wizard mini suitable for use as – you guessed it – a wizard and an Imperial Light Wizard suitable for use as an Apothecary.  +$20 (based on the hours that went into making the Celestial Wizard so beautiful)
* Dwarf Grudgebearers Team in box: 2 Troll Slayers, 2 Blitzers, 2 Runners, and 8 (2 extra) Long Beards.  All but three of the Long Beards are badly painted (by someone else, I hasten to add), which IMO is worse than unpainted.  Decals not present.  Numbers marked on primed bases w/ pencil.  +$25
* Wood Elf Athelorn Avengers Team in box: 2 Wardancers, 3 (1 extra) Catchers, 2 Throwers, 8 (2 extra) Linemen.  Primed but unpainted, decal sheet present. +$30
* Skaven Skavenblight Scramblers Team in box: 3 (1 extra) Gutter Runners, 2 Throwers, 2 Storm Vermin, 8 (2 extra) Linemen, 1 (extra) Rat Ogre, 3 (extra) Mutants (Big Hand, Extra Arm, Claw).  All primed but unpainted, decal sheet present. +$40
OR, take all the optional extras as a package for +$90.  Please note that I will NOT try to shaft BGG out of their 3% on the payment for the optional extras.  This just seemed like the best way to post a single-topic, multi-part lot.</notes>

    <notes>- Box shows a little minor wear, but overall looks really nice.
- Components are in near perfect condition, this game has never been played.
- MISSING: star player cards, painting guide, entire Orc football team miniatures
- Human team miniatures have been primed and some partially painted.
Essentially this was bought by someone who started painting the miniatures, got tired, but kept the Orc team because he was pleased with them.  Everything else hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been used and is great shape.</notes>

Box may have some shelf-wear and couple of bumps due to storage (you know about those GW soft-boxes... it is kind of flimsy), but nothing major. Please see pictures.
Buyers pay actual shipping, I round up to the nearest dollar (to cover gas money etc).

    <notes>*Reserved for Tom*
   A long time ago, I purchased this game which was opened but unplayed and had a lot of extras added. I then purchased 4 professionally painted player groups from RAL Collectables. In 2006, I printed out the Blood Bowl Handbook (61 pages) and bound it. The only thing missing was an opponent. Even with 3 sons, 1 daughter and a game-playing husband, I could never find anybody who would play the game with me. I have finally given up and am selling the entire lot. I will describe it as clearly as possible. If you have questions, please email. It has been so long since I purchased everything that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember the exact teams that I had RAL Collectables paint.
   In the game box (which has shelf wear, it was taped shut when it was shipped to me, but all corners are intact):
- original handbook, mail order catalogue, unused team 
  roster tablet, 4 footballs, 9 dice, 2 cardboard copies of
  the agility tables, how to paint your models, Blood Bowl
  magazine issues 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2 with 4th Edition rules, Orc Team 
  card, Human Team card, introduction on how to play, 
  unpunched counters #1 thru #16, Griff Oberwald card, 
  Nobbla Blackwart card, Scrappa Sorehead card, Morg _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;
  Thorg card, Death Zone cardboard chart (shows wear and has
  a 1/2 inch tear), unpunched sheet of markers, 2 tables 
  with First Half - Second Half - Rerolls, etc, plastic 
  football square with 1-8, plastic measurement for length 
  of passes), unused stickers for Gouged Eye _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Reikland
  Reavers, unused game board, square plastic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;sideline_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
- laminated team charts for Amazon, Chaos, Chaos Dwarf, 
  High Elf, Halfling, Lizardman, Khemri, Dark Elf, Skaven,
  Orc, Human, Dwarf, Necromantic, Norse, Elf, Nurgle, Ogre,
  Vampire, Undead, Wood Elf, Goblin
- 25 characters were in the box, some painted
- 4 unpainted metal scantily clad women (not sure what they
  are)
3 of the 4 teams (or possibly partial teams, some have more miniatures than others) that I purchased and had painted were put in a hard plastic travel box with foam. You can see what the boxes look like if you look up RAL Collectables on youtube. He was out of boxes so one of the teams was put in a styrofoam-type container that he hollowed out to fit the pieces.
    In a black travel box, there are 17 undead miniatures. 16 are plastic - some look like skeletons and some look like zombie skeletons. One is a metal Frankenstein. This is my personal favorite team.
    In a blue travel box, 16 pieces are metal and 1 is 
plastic - the team has minotaurs and what look like golems?
    In a red travel box, there are 16 plastic pieces that I 
think are armoured humans.
    In the hollowed out styrofoam-like container are 12 painted plastic miniatures that I think are goblins - they have pointy helmets.
    The 3 hard plastic cases with foam inserts have room for more miniatures.
    I apologize for my general descriptions - I am no longer
familiar with the game. But I will answer any questions and 
if somebody wants pictures just email me. My husband took pictures that I will eventually post on BGG. If you want the pictures and they are not posted yet, just send me your email address and I will send them to you.</notes>
