   <description>In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Schmidt Spiel version of Acquire.  The game components include the wonderful plastic towers that you play to the board with the plug-in chain markers.  Instead of tiles you have cards with the coordinates of the squares on them.  It includes the special powers variant cards in the game (in German, of course).  It has been played twice, and the game components are in excellent condition.  The box was damaged a bit on the trip to me from Germany, it has one split corner and some edge wear.  
I accept Pay Pal payments from Bank Accounts only, no credit cards.  I charge actual priority mail shipping plus .50 handling fee.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Schmidt Spiele version (1993), which I think was the first to introduce special power cards.  It has a huge board, a plastic grid overlay and over 170 beautiful plastic 3D _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hotels_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Box and all contents in superb condition - the game has only been played once (because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the special powers).  English translation included.

    <notes>The old Grey Box edition, one tile came up missing and we replaced it with a supplemental tile printed to match the rest of the game.  This tile is indistinguishable from other tiles.  A couple of the tiles were printed crookedly and are a little hard to read.  Has been played numerous times, but we moved on to the updated version.  Cheap!

    <notes>AH Edition. Has a few _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;issues_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Box has shelf scuff and has one split corner.
Tiles are all there, though for some reason, one letter group has been covered up with green _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;dot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stickers, (maybe two letters looked too similar for their tastes), and while I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure these could be removed without a problem, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll leave that to the buyer.
Some of the stock cards (around 7 or so), appear to have some damage to the edges, although this is very slight and of course, has no bearing on play.
Pictures abvailable upon request. </notes>

Domestic shipping will be $10.50.  International shipping will probably be around $25.00 but you should contact me for a quote if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Latest Hasbro/Avalon Hill edition. German edition, but components are pretty much language independent (except the rules of course :).
Box shows just a little shelfwear. Inside everything there in great condition. Looking at the cards and the play money I doubt the game has ever been played.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>AH edition (all plastic) as per these images of my game:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/252344
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/252339
Not sure how to classify the condition of this game.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played maybe three times, has a tiny bit of shelf scuffing around the edges on the box, the bits are all fine, but brand new it arrived with the box improperly covered.
eg:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/252341
I *think* it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be about $11 shipping interstate within Australia. Might be hand delivered within Sydney.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d prefer EFT within Australia, or Paypal. (Buyer to pay any Paypal charges.)
I would actually also ship overseas, pending checking the (rather high) shipping costs, on an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;all due care no responsibility_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; basis.</notes>

Box shows shelf wear but is intact except for one split corner. And thats the reason for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rating.
The game material is all there, and in perfect (like new) condition).

    <notes>1968 3M version (yellow plastic board and black tiles). 100% complete and unplayed! On the inside, this game is like new! Money and stock certificates have not been separated from their original pads! The six information cards are still on one sheet; they have not been separated along the perforations yet! Tiles have not been removed from their original plastic bagging! Even includes the original slip inserted by _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Inspector #12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; way back in 1968! Board is perfect and like new. Inner box is in perfect condition. Outer box slipcase cover is a little beat up after 40 years -- shelf wear, a few minor abrasions, and one edge is split. So while the outside of the box doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look great, the contents seem to have come through a time warp from 1968 -- Like New!

The original plastic bag that the pieces came in is still there but it was torn open. The 3M catalog is still in the box. There is no manual as it is printed on the top of the box cover. The box shows some shelfwear. all 175 stock certificates are in perfect condition save one that has a small stain on it.

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by 3M, date on cover 1968 - date on rules, 1971 - Acquire - COMPLETE.  Outer Box is in very good condition especially considering it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age.  There is the usual wear along the edges (particularly at the corners) and a small tear on the middle right on the cover (see photos).  Also, their is some sticker residue on the top right on the cover as well.  Note: There are (4) small drops of dried paint (white) on the back of the box (largest about the size of a pencil eraser).  Interior contents are in excellent condition, pieces are plastic.  Board is in very solid shape with no noticable cracks or fatigue.  Cards and money are all very solid and crisp.  Inner box (lid) has one taped corner - inner box (bottom) also has one taped corner.  See actual item photos below for further detail.  This game will weigh around 3.25 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping.  I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address.  Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above.  
Communication: (please read before buying)
I will email you once an item has been bought providing you with shipping options prior to the confirmation (payment) email.  If I do not hear back from you within three (3) days by email (either through bgg-mail or personal email (to my hotmail account) I will cancel the purchase.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through paypal but will also accept moneyorders if need be.  For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal.  I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation).  
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $0.85 (for delivery confirmation).  Insurance is optional but recommended.  I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay.  Although I no longer sell on Ebay, you can look up my user id:  junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks.
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above.  Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway.  I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility.  All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Thanks,
Jon

There are 2 tiny dings on the box cover on the crease that were probably there when I bought it but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember. All pieces are accounted for. The cards look untouched (and I know we played it so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get that!)

    <notes>This is a 3M Bookshelf Game version of Acquire, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing from the 1970s. 
The box is the kind with a slipcover over another box. One corner of the cover is coming a little unglued, but is _not_ split. There is the expected scuffing on the slipcover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s edges, but the box honestly looks great. There are no price markings anywhere on the cover.
This copy has plastic tiles and is complete, with rules on the underside of the lid. The game board is yellow plastic.
This copy is a little unusual, as the cover image goes all the way to the edge, rather than the bordered one you see on most similar versions on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Geek. It is the same size as other 3M copies I have seen.</notes>

    <notes>[Avalon Hill mid 70s version]
Box is in acceptable condition, with obvious wear, a moderately concave box top, and a small (1/2 inch) L-shaped dent on one side.
Stock certificates and money are in good condition.  Pieces are in very good condition.  Board is clean and unmarred, but has a very slight upward bow.  (The pieces still fit on the board just fine.) 
Shipping for this game is $10.20 within the US (for fixed rate priority mail). Note that I do reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount. (I charge an estimate of the actual shipping cost.)</notes>

    <notes>This is the 3M Bookshelf version.  All the pieces are there (plastic tiles) and the box is in good condition.  My guess is that it was never played (I have a second copy that I play) based on how it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s packaged -- little slips of paper separating the company stock certificates.
Shipping is USPS from 20906.  Probably around $6.</notes>

    <notes>1999 Avalon Hill/Hasbro edition.
Game was never played and all plastic pieces are still in plastic.  Reference cards are unpunched - but two have already come loose and the others are following suit.  One deck of stock cards is still in plastic, the other has been opened.  Graded _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for two specific reasons.  One, the box shows obvious wear with a price written in black marker on bottom.  No split corners, but obvious scuffing, a faint 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; coffee stain on top, and some rippling in the front artwork surface. Two, ten of the stock cards have minor faint creases.  Rest of the open cards are practically like new.  This is a completely functional game with almost all the wear to the box.
Shipping within US only. 
I do online selling full time so if the buyer has any concerns after purchase they should contact me and I will do my best to correct any problems.</notes>

All of the stock certificates have the old style blue lines on the back. The money is the 3M4FUN4U2 version. Some of the stock certificates have some slight discoloration but otherwise the certificates, money and player aides all look unplayed. The inner box is complete and in excellent shape with no split corners and very little wear. The outer box has some moderate shelf wear but is unbroken with no split corners and is generally in very good shape. The components are exactly as seen in this photo:

I ship via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation were possible.

    <notes>This is a 1976 Bookshelf game edition in the blue box but doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the outer sleeve. I would swear this game has never been played. It is opened but all of the stock certificates are still kind of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;compressed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the corners for them are all VERY sharp as though they were fresh from the punch. The money itself is still beautiful and clean as are the reference cards. All of the plastic tiles have little bits sticking off the edges as though they were just removed from the plastic sprues. The board itself is beautifully bright and clean with no scratches at all.
The outside box has minimal shelf wear and the upper right corner is slightly banged as though it were dropped and landed then. No corners are torn though. 
If you are looking for a complete, excellent condition of this version of the game then this is your copy.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship this anywhere in the world but you pay the actual postage. </notes>

    <notes>1999 Hasbro AH edition.
Everything inside still in sealed plastic!  Buildings, cards, stocks, plastic pieces.
Two flaws:  Missing the English directions. Includes only the German directions.  Everything else is in English, including an original Avalon Hill catalog.  Second, there are faint 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; diagonal creases in one corner of the box top.  Very light edge wear to box as well.
Shipping will be within 50 cents of actual cost.  Local pickup/delivery is a possibility for the southern NH/ME and eastern MA region.</notes>

The box and componenets are excellent except as noted below.  The gameboard is yellow.  
The Blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; hotel tile is missing.  I replaced it with a round blue token with the letter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; on it.
The 1-F tile was missing.  I had a spare 4-B tile that I used to replace the 1-F tile by using a black permanent marker to color in some of the white lines.</notes>

    <notes>Old and battered!  The box is a mess but still holds the game.  This is the 1968 version and it has been played MANY times. Think major thrift store condition (and price) here.
But here is the thing--this is a great game and this copy is complete (in fact there are about 75 extra tiles thrown in just for the heck of it).  There is one tile that has been converted from 12-C to 12-G with White Out!  SO what you are getting is a VERY old and used but complete and VERY playable version of a classic game.</notes>

    <notes>1999 Avalon Hill/Hasbro English large box edition. Very little shelf wear (corners) and slight dishing on lid that you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really notice unless you look from the side. There is also a wrinkle along the edge of the top that seems to be typical of AH game boxes. Otherwise, box only shows slight wear in the corners. Components are complete and look like new. Very good to like new condition overall. Shipping is free. I do NOT accept Paypal for payment. If you want to pay online, you must use Amazon Payments. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s easy and free to sign up and they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge fees. I also accept cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check or money order. S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is $14. Payment is expected to be submitted or mailed within 48 hours of the sale.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Acquire
Description: Acquire from 3M (plastic tiles/board). Box is appropriate worn/aged given the game is 40+ years old. Components are in great shape.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>1962 3M version with WOODEN pieces.  I only rated this as good because the box has some scuff marks and wears along the edges but the pieces, stocks, board, and money are all counted and present and in very good condition with no creases, tears, or stains.  Inside slip cover has one split corner.
I have tried to describe the game as best as possible, but if you want pictures of the game please ask and I will take them for you.</notes>

Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the 1999 version with all of the plastic goodness.  Additionally there is an expansion from another version included, the one that gives you special power chits to use once per game.  The components are in like new condition.  The box, however has seen better days, some shelf wear and bubbling, not too bad and the box is still completely functional.

    <notes>1968 version with the ivory plastic board with Black pieces. All in good condition and seems like it has been played very little. Box has a blemish in the upper left hand corner of the cover (tape mark?) and on the lower right some one has written 1.00 in grease pencil. Otherwise average box shelf wear for a 1968 game. </notes>

Shipping:
I am happy to combine shipping on multiple items.
I can ship from both US and (if you are patient) Canada.
I will find the cheapest shipping method. Within the continental USA, this is typically Fedex. International shipping can be very expensive. 
Insurance and tracking:
I recommend paying for both of these. As a hobbyist and an individual seller, I cannot take responsibility for items that are damaged or lost in transit.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill (Hasbro) English large box edition from 1999.
The game is no longer in shrinkwrap but it has not been played.  All game components have been accounted for.  Both deck of stock certificates have opened to check for missing cards.  This copy of the game also has half a set of replacement stock certificates.  One of the original sealed decks had ink splots on some of the cards.  Hasbro sent an entire replacement deck (which contains 1/2 half of stock certificates).  Unfortunately, the backs of the replacement cards are a bit brighter than the original printing and you can tell visually.  Luckily, there are no gameplay issues.
As the box has been sitting around for 10+ years, there is a bit of shelf wear on the outside game box.  On the game box top, the ink is starting to wear off in about four spots on the various edges of the box.  So far just small spots here and there.  The box bottom has a few more spots of fading ink again at the edges and box corners.  One corner of the game box (upper right from the box bottom point of view) appears to have a minor crunch with a small tear in the cover of the box bottom.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>This is the wooden tile 3M Edition.  There is no outer box or sleeve, only the inner box.  There is one tile missing - the turquoise tile for the Continental chain.  A plastic betting chip that approximates the color of the tile is included so the game is playable.  Please note the condition of the box in the image provided.
This price is for Anton only.</notes>

    <notes>Edition:  Avalon Hill (Hasbro) 1999!  (the best one)
Language:  English
Condition:  Very Good Condition.  Single owner.  Played only once, at home.  Box is in very good condition.  Some wear on box.  The paper is peeling off from one of the box corners and the box has some scratches that do not go through the paper but are visible in the right light.  Some whitening of box, especially the bottom edges.  Components are all in very good condition and inventoried complete.  See pictures of the actual item for sale:  https://goo.gl/photos/74QWS6t7WPEVjcqL8.
Shipping and handling:  This is a large box -- oversized, will not fit in a flat rate box.  I will package it carefully and ship it insured.  Buyer will pay for packaging and shipping costs.  Depending on where it needs to be shipped the packaging and shipping costs are usually between $25 and $30.
Local Delivery:  Local pickup is available in Mount Vernon or Bellingham, WA.  I am also occasionally available for local pickup in Seattle, WA (please check first).
Payment:  Paypal or Google Wallet.</notes>

    <notes>Prettiest version of Acquire, as far as my eyes see :)
Little bit of damage around the box corners. Game itself is complete and in very nice condition, can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see a lot of use. 
German edition, but the game itself looks rather language independent. You probably just need rules in another language.
Shipping: Germany €6,99 - Europe € 18,00 DHL including insurance where available.</notes>

Reserved for zastrygon for pickup at Gen Con
Please submit payment via PayPal, Google Wallet or Venmo to gramaw@gmail.com.  Alternatively, you may pay, via one of these methods or COD, directly at the convention.  
Since I am selling so many games I plan to meet as many buyers as possible on Saturday morning at 9AM outside of hall A on level 1 of the convention center, near room 128 (this was the former location of multiple Gen Con Math trade meetups, in case you are familiar.)  You can find a link to a map of the denoted area here:    https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4236187/gramaw
If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>
