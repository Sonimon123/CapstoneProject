   <description>Risk 2210 A.D. is yet another entry in the long series of Risk variants.  Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODs, for short.  Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities.  These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game.  Now the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk.  One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours.  Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy.  This energy is used to purchase command cards, bid for turn order, and hire new commanders.  There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Risk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Box top has a slight crease on the upper left corner and one of the box corners has been repaired with clear tape.

    <notes>Original Large box addition.  Great condition some minor shelf wear. Never actually played it. I purchased it when I came to Anchorage from my small town thinking it would be the game being played.  I was wrong.
From my understanding it is a great game and fun to play.  My wife recently purchased a classic series Risk game for me so letting this one go. Especially since I have not played it so no real reason to keep it.
Shipping is expensive.  I like to use Priority Mail shipping so it in the mail less time.
If you want a cheaper method let me know and I can get you a quote.
International bidders ask for shipping quote first.</notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill - Risk 2210 
Language: English
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 10+
Duration: about 120 min
Weight: 1.600 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Risk 2210 A.D. is set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODS, for short. Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities. These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game. Now, the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds. Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk. One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours. Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy. This energy is used to purchase Command cards, bid for Turn Order, and hire new commanders. There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.

    <notes>Shelf wear, but unpunched, cards still sealed: i.e. never been played. Big-box edition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 106oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order, typically $15 in the US). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition, has been handled with TLC
My late husband was an avid board gamer and game collector.  Sadly the time has come for me to find new homes for all his games. (Except my favorites :) )  He took excellent care of all his games, no eating or drinking allowed while playing a game.  He had a huge collection, and most of his games had never even been played.  Feel free to message me with any questions or concerns.   Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>This is the big box version.  The box cover looks like it got some water on it and there is some wrinkling on the lower half (see photo).  Game contents are in very good condition.  The cards and rules are flat, unmarked and crisp.  The brown army has never been used and is in original plastic.
This is a heavy box, packaged it will weigh over 5 lbs, so it will be expensive to ship internationally and must ship USPS Priority.</notes>
