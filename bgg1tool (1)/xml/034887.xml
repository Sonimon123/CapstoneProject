Blackmail the printer. Threaten the innkeeper. Bribe the priest. Welcome to Revolution!
Secretly bid against your opponents to win the support of the people, control territory . . . and gather more gold, blackmail, and force for the next round of bidding! The revolutionary with the most support wins the game, but each location grants bonus points. The tavern or the fortress? The harbor or the plantation? Knowing which areas to hold -- and which to let your opponents fight over -- is the key to victory. But are your opponents bidding on the same location, or are they bluffing? Are you bluffing?
Bidding tokens have different shapes (and colors) for easy identification, even across the table. Colorful cardstock shields keep your bids private, and provide a handy rules reference while you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re deliberating during the auction. Traditional wooden blocks allow players to see, at a glance, who controls what.
The rules can be taught in minutes, and plays with three or four players. A complete game takes less than an hour, even for the first time. Each new game lets players discover new strategies and tactics.

Blackmail the printer. Threaten the innkeeper. Bribe the priest. Welcome to Revolution! Secretly bid against your opponents to win the support of the people, control territory . . . and gather more gold, blackmail, and force for the next round of bidding! The revolutionary with the most support wins the game, but each location grants bonus points. The tavern or the fortress? The harbor or the plantation? Knowing which areas to hold -- and which to let your opponents fight over -- is the key to victory. But are your opponents bidding on the same location, or are they bluffing? Are you bluffing?

    <notes>Excellent condition, except that it is missing one of the original yellow cubes that came with the game-- I have substituted a yellow cube from a different game.  The substitute cube is a slightly different color and size, but that will not affect game play since cubes are never blindly drawn from a bag, or anything like that.  One of the photos shows the substitute cube, along with three of the actual cubes-- sorry it is blurry, I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get it to focus any better.
Other than the substitute cube, the game is in excellent condition. The box is in very good condition with no split corners, and just slight dishing and wear along the edges.</notes>
