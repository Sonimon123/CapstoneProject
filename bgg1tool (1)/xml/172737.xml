   <description>High Frontier (3rd edition) is a space exploration game by Phil Eklund. The players take control of different space enterprises trying to establish factories on planets and asteroids. Each player begins with three water tanks (fuel). In turns each player uses two action points to do some of the eight actions available, e.g. move space ship or buy new technologies. When the predetermined number of bases is built the game ends. The winner is the player with the most victory points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;High Frontier (3rd edition) is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;deluxe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; edition including both the High Frontier base game and the Colonization expansion, as well as 31 new card designs and redesigned charts. The rules are in four volumes: Basic, Colonization, Interstellar, and Super-Advanced Variants._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I went a little Kickstarter crazy, need to stem what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s coming in! This is for the Deluxe 3rd Ed of High Frontier, including shipping to you in the US. Order soon, not sure when it will ship!
Buyer chooses online patient method and is responsible for payment fees if incurred - if using PayPal, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is without fee (no buyer protection) while _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;merchant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; has $3 in fees. Amazon.com gift cards are also okay!</notes>

    <notes>I am a Kickstarter backer for the new 3rd edition. I backed at the $69 level which includes the game, stretch goals, and free shipping. 
The survey collecting mailing addresses for this game is scheduled to be sent by the end of April. If you purchase this item, I will input your mailing address into the survey and keep you posted on Kickstarter updates. Shipping is supposed to start in May.</notes>

    <notes>Reserved for jkantor.
Important: You would be buying my Kickstarter pledge, the game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t out yet.
Astronaut level pledge for one copy of the game and all stretch goals.
I will forward you all Kickstarter updates from the creators, and once I get the game I will ship it off to you via USPS Priority at no additional cost to you. If another survey comes out or I am able to get the creators to change my shipping address, I will just use whatever mailing address you give me.
Full disclosure: This Kickstarter has been controversial (a trainwreck as far as I am concerned), so be forewarned. Check the discussions on the Kickstarter page and the BGG page before you commit to this. At this point, I think the creators will deliver a game, but I am skeptical about the quality. Regardless, I am tired of being jerked around, but judging from KS and BGG discussions, there seem to be plenty of people more favorably disposed towards the project. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re one of them, this is your chance to get yourself a pledge.</notes>

    <notes>IMPORTANT!!! This is a yet unfulfilled Kickstarter project.
The purchase is for my pledge. I am no longer interested in the game and wish to sell it.
I am in Denmark, and we might be able to change the pledge to another EU country with no additional shipping. Or we maybe have to ship it from Denmark after it arrives (expensive). I will be happy to try and change my shipping name/address for a potential buyer.
Please note, the project is currently delayed. I estimate shipping in Q2 2017.</notes>

Price includes courier (and this thing is heavy) to the UK - check with me for postage to the rest of Europe.</notes>

    <notes>This is the brand new Kickstarter edition.  I opened the box to check to make sure the contents were complete.   The cards were removed from their wrapping to examine and have been put in baggies.  The rules have been read through, but like all other contents are in like new condition.  This package is HEAVY.  I will ship through FedEX or UPS (they will packaged the game) and give price quotes upon request.  I will not ship to Russia or Brazil.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new Kickstarter. Out of wrap and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve gazed admiringly at the map once, in the full knowledge that I would probably never get this beguiling game to the table.  Hence, and with some sadness, I offer it up for sale.  Otherwise untouched.  Apparently there are two cards that need replacing, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll obviously throw those in as well once they arrive. Shipping to the UK and EU--I imagine other destinations would be prohibitive, cost-wise, as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big and heavy box.  Also happy to hand over in person if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in or around London.</notes>

    <notes>Played twice.  Box and components are in great condition, showing little to no wear.  One board has a small crease on one corner from shipping (see picture).
This is being listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; according to the BGG guidelines only because one yellow Bernal cylinder is missing.  It came to me this way and pursuing a replacement from the publisher became difficult.

Shrink taken off but never played. I opened it up once to look at the pretty maps.
If you want to avoid shipping costs, I live in Manhattan, NYC, and would be happy to do a cash deal there.
If you want to send a personal check, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to wait until it clears to send the game.</notes>

3rd edition notes: the rulebook has been GREATLY improved and simplified (which is not to say it is a simple game at all! Phil Eklund doesn’t make wimpy games. Ha!). Also, 3rd edition includes and integrates  the expansion content from previous editions right out of the box.</notes>
