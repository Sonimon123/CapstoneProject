   <description>The shadows of the Sixth World have every kind of danger you can imagine: ultra-violent gangers, flesh-eating ghouls, mages that summon spirits from toxic waste, backstabbing corporate raiders, hard-nosed police officers, and even dragons. You don't have much _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst the mean streets can throw at you? You're about to find out._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Shadowrun: Crossfire is a cooperative deck-building card game for two to four players set in the gritty, cyberpunk fantasy world of Shadowrun. Play a shadowrunner team and take on tough jobs such as protecting a client who's marked for death, shooting your way out of downtown when a run goes sour, or facing down a dragon. In each game you'll improve your deck with a mix of strategies, while earning Karma to give your character cyber upgrades, physical augmentations, magical initiations, weapons training and Edge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Shadowrun: Crossfire includes two obstacle decks, a black market deck, a crossfire event deck, mission sheets, role cards, runner cards, and upgrade stickers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Crossing cyberpunk with fantasy and plunging  players into a world dominated by ruthless megacorporations, Crossfire gives players  the chance to dive into the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shadows to see if they can survive. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have weapons, spells, contacts, and gear to help them out, and they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re going to need those resources. If they play their cards right, though, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do more than survive-they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll become legends. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The cards in Shadowrun: Crossfire are terrific, filled with combos and potential for cooperation among the players. On the other side the challenges and events are terrifying and combine in unexpected ways. The game swings back and forth between _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;We are doomed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;We are omnipotent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; in a fashion that makes me want to play again._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; -Richard Garfield</notes>

BEAT THE STREET! The shadows of the Sixth World have every kind of danger you can imagine. Ultra-violent gangers, flesh-eating ghouls, mages that summon spirits from toxic waste, backstabbing corporate raiders, hard-nosed police officers, and even dragons. You don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much - mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends. But maybe that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s  enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the  Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork  from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst  the mean streets can throw at you? You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re about to find out. Shadowrun: Crossfire is a deck-building game in one of the most  popular game settings of all time.

    <notes>Game has been played a handful of times.  Most of the sticker sheets have been used but applied to Chipboard to allow for easy reuse without stickering the player cards ( I did this to also allow for drawing random powers for each runner, which in my opinion should have been done during the design of the game anyways).  
Game also comes with the first character pack.
Ships from 03087 via USPS.  Paypal only.

Insert has a small portion that is broken because it is very flimsy. Still fully functional.
Buyer pays for shipping. The box fits in flush in a medium USPS box, so padding will be very thin. You can also choose large USPS flat rate box, this will allow me to pad it better. Either way I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to make sure it is as well protected as possible.</notes>

    <notes>all cards have been sleeved right from the unboxing, no stickers have been used, nor have the character cards been written on or the likes. Rulebook has been folded in half to temporarily fit in a smaller box (the original box is enormous, so shipping will also not be cheap), hence why I put _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;VG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-Condition.
I sell the High-Caliber Ops expansion separately. Shipping of course can be combined.</notes>

All cards are sleeved, no stickers have been used. 
Self printed (black _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; white) laminated sticker copies are included. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not perfect or particulary pretty, but can be used to clip onto the character mats instead of commiting to a sticker.

On some cards a very tiny bit of information on those cards can be cut off at the corners (see pics), but all the necessary information is there and the print job is good.

Has only been played with sleeves and everything is therefore in excellent condition. A few (5-10) of the stickers have been used but were peeled off of the character sheet and placed on their sticker sheets again. The character cards are untouched by this but I suppose that those few stickers may need some extra glue if you were to reuse them.</notes>

    <notes>Played once, and sleeved with UltraPro MATTE sleeves prior to play (sleeves included) this copy is in EXCELLENT condition. The Promo Character Cards have been laminated. I was going to do them all but after doing the first two I realized they really did not need lamination. However it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s nice that the rare promos are laminated because that menas no matter what you can get rid of Wet-Erase marks _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; stickers off if you should so choose to.
Included:
Shadowrun: Crossfire – Character Expansion Pack 2: Street Legends [NEW IN SHRINK!]
Shadowrun: Crossfire – High Caliber Ops
Shadowrun: Crossfire – Oni Promo Card
Shadowrun: Crossfire – Harlequin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shadow Promo Card
Photos available upon request.
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 5 pounds so figure an extra pound or so of packing material.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:

    <notes>Includes High Caliber Ops expansion, which adds tons of gameplay. All cards are sleeved. Everything is in one box. Shipping might be close to $20 given the size and weight of the box, but you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t easily find both the game and expansion for this price. Please Geekmail me with any questions before buying!</notes>
