   <description>Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;board_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;capture the flag_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;playing with the rules_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Big Sell Out_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Richard Garfield himself considered Netrunner as his best boardgame design instead of CCG design game, and he loves games that include bluffing mechanics; with Netrunner, bluffing is an integral part of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When it was released in 1996, many gaming magazines gave Netrunner critical acclaim as the best CCG ever designed.   Even today, most of them still consider this to be true._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I have slightly less than 60 cards each for the Corporation and the Runner. Cards are all in like new condition, have been opened and played with once but no defects or wear. All cards are from the original edition (no expansions). It is likely that these are from a starter set missing a couple of cards from each deck. Frankly, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been so long that I have forgotten exactly what happened.</notes>

    <notes>Netrunner.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not entirely positive, but am reasonable sure all of these cards are from the 1.1 edition. Great condition. 
340+ cards, roughly half runner and half corporate. I know there are some rares, uncommons and commons in there - but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know exactly what.
I welcome international buyers!</notes>

    <notes>Netrunner 2 Player Starter Deck.  Includes complete 60 card deck for each player (total 120 cards) plus rulebook.
These cards are brand new, never opened.  I bought a case on eBay and I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need all of these.  Noticed no one was carrying them here so I thought I would do all of us a favor!
Netrunner plays incredibly well out of the starters (some say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;it is the only way to play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).  No need to be obsessed about collecting this game - one starter is enough (imo).

I am out of starters, the posted price is for a complete set of 1.0 commons, but let me know what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d specifically like and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll put together a custome listing for you.

Complete set of limited commons (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got four sets), $12 each set
Complete set of limited vitals (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got two sets, possibly more once I get all my cards sorted), $8 each set
Complete set of limited uncommons, $30
Bundle of 50 uncommons (no duplicates), $12
Inquire about rares, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only got a few extras outside the near complete base set listed below.

    <notes>This sale is for a bulk lot of 457 Netrunner cards.  The lot includes 445 cards from the Unlimited Edition (1.0) and 12 cards from the Proteus Edition (2.1).  In total the lot includes 123 uncommon cards and 23 rares.  See the card list presented below for a full list of cards included in the lot.
I am willing to ship via any method the buyer prefers, however, I recommend flat rate Priority Mail because it is economical and fast.

    <notes>Unopened Netrunner 1.0 booster box. The original shrinkwrap is still intact, but the box itself has fallen apart a little. The packs inside are fine, though.
Buyer pays actual shipping cost for USPS Priority Mail. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to save a few dollars on shipping, I can take the packs out of the box - that should let them fit in a smaller package. I will ship to Canada and Europe, but it could take me more time to sort out shipping costs and get to the PO - be patient.</notes>

    <notes>This is the last of what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve collected and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling as either a single lot for $275 or I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll break it into three equal lots and sell each third for $110.
The collection is comprised of 2008 total cards from version 1.0 (the base set of Netrunner), nearly all of which are in like new, unplayed condition.  There are 299 vitals (between 3 and 11 of all 44 vitals in the limited edition); 950 commons (between 6 and 15 of each of the 88 commons); 638 uncommons (with at least 1 of 131 of the 132 uncommons; generally have 2 or more of each uncommon); and 120 rares (74 unique rares of the 110).
I can provide a complete listing of the entire collection as an excel spreadhseet upon request.  If you want a third of the collection, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll split the collection evenly, trying to maximize the diversity of cards.  I can provide a listing for each lot and let you pick the lot you want.
Shipping will be $10 to the US regardless of whether you want the entire collection or just a third.  Other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>Two 1st Edition  Netrunner Deckmaster Starter Double Deck Boxes (total of four decks of cards, 240 cards total).  Cards have been opened and were looked at when I first bought them, but have never been played.  Not sure what the breakdown was, but I’m guessing 2-3 rares, 5-8 uncommons and the remaining 50+/- commons in each deck.  I do not know enough about the cards or how they were marked for rarity to tell you what is what, but if you’re interested and can guide me, we’ll figure it out.  There is also an additional 60 cards from boosters.  Not sure if these came 12 or 15 to a booster, but these have also never been played.
Finally, this lot includes one copy of the Mastering NetRunner book by Ben Matthews and Charles Schwope.  Book is bagged and boarded, and has been since it was bought.  </notes>

I can fit them in to a smaller flate rate envelope for the 5.35 shipping.  it is tight and i have no idea how it will hold up for shipping.  I havent had any problems before.  If you decide you want the larger medium flat rate box let me know.  just pay the 11.35 instead.

    <notes>Moving house, found this in one of the old boxes. Loved the game back then!
I have no more clue about the rarity of the cards and have no intention of listing each and every card, but bought a lot of boosters and starters back then. Most of it from the first set, some cards from the first expansion.
Not shown on the three pictures, but there are also two (possibly up to 4) decks.
I could make some more pictures if needed. Please contact me for an accurate shipping quote.</notes>

    <notes>A large lot of cards, around 1100 or so by my rough eyeballing, sorted in a long BCW card storage box and in an original starter box with two sets of rules.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not the original owner, but the previous owner took very good care of this.  Checking a few example cards against rarity lists shows that this is a pretty expected selection, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not like all the rares have been picked out or anything.  This looks like somebody bought a box and/or a bunch of boosters and just sorted and kept great care of their cards and played them sparingly, if at all.  Two cards have been written on, and look like they were used as proxies, but everything else is in pristine condition.</notes>
