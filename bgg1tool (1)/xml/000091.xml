In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     316 full-color die-cut counters:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         176 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; die cut counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         140 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; die cut counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     One 22x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     110 Strategy Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Two Player Reference Cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Second edition.  Played several times, but still in great condition.  
This also includes the Paths of Glory Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide.  This includes all of the cards that came with it, plus the extra counters (counters have been punched and bagged).  Cards and counters are in great condition.  The player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s guide has some minor wear on the spine (from being read), but beyond that is in excellent condition.
I will sell the two seprately as well, but I can only have one listing under a game.  The game is 42.99 and the players guide is 52.99 w/ cards and counters.

They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War. 
Paths of Glory, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts Award winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918.

I am always fair with the shipping cost, read my feed back.

    <notes>Game is Like New condition with one very important exception see below.
Game has a complete set of unused counter/playing pieces and includes the mounted board from GMT.  It also has the Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide cards and additional pieces (though not the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s guide itself).  Box has some extremely minor scuffs and the map, pieces, dice, etc... are all in great shape.
I played this game once and only once--at the World Boardgaming Championships a few years back.  The WBC uses a variant in which some additional Victory Point spaces are assigned and others are removed.  To indicate this on the board I attached small adhesive stars (silver and gold) to the board.  I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be sure if these could be removed, but honestly I much prefer the WBC version of the game anyhow (and use it when playing PoG online).  </notes>

This is the 2004 GotY printing and includes the thicker deluxe map as well. Cards were taken out of shrink, counters were punched, but everything is flawless and stored in baggies.

Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.95 (small), $13.10 (medium), or $17.90 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>This is the GMT edition with the mounted board.  Included is a complete set of unpunched counters.  I tried clipping the corners of the game piece and thought they turned out OK, but not perfect, so I ordered an original set of unpunched counters from GMT as well--in other words, this game comes with both clipped and unclipped counters, which would be useful in case one a piece goes missing.  Stored in a smoke free home.  Buyer pays shipping via USPS priority mail.</notes>

    <notes>1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. If you want the game to be shipped outside of the USA, please geekmail me first. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.</notes>

    <notes>Comes with player guide.
Main game is unpunched, cards are sleeved.
Player guide has all cards, but I got it with a weird/wrong counter mix. Should be easy enough to proxy.
If not mentioned otherwise, barely played, if at all (I have a tendency to sleeve everything and never play...)
Smoke-free, no pets, no kids home.
Let me know if you need some pics.
Shipping:
Will only ship insured, but will try to find the best shipping option.
