   <description>Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Survive is very similar to Escape from Atlantis with some key differences._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Survive was reprinted as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Survive: Escape from Atlantis!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; by publisher Stronghold Games and hit store shelves in February, 2011.

    <notes>Parker Brothers 1982, Canadian bilingual edition
This copy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s box is somewhat worse for the wear (four split corners, a tear on one side, a fair amount of tape residue around the corners) but the contents are in fine shape.  The cardboard insert isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t even concave, the board shows hints of wear along its hinge, the pieces are barely worn at all.  The rules sheet has been _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;textured_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in an odd way (the last page is all lightly dimpled).  Still, a fine playing copy!</notes>

    <notes>This is the Parker Brothers U. S. edition. Game is missing 1 yellow #3 piece and one beach hexagon. Game is still totally playable. The beach piece could be homemade or just ignored. The yellow pieces can be used in the game just fine by leaving out a #3 of each of the other colors. The box is in good shape with no split corners, medium shelf wear, and minor scuffing.</notes>

This game is complete with the components bagged by type.  The board and all cardboard pieces are in excellent condition with no signs of wear.  Original instructions are included.  The box is in very good condition with very minor scuffing and great vivid color, but two corners are ripped (can be easily repaired by owner).
The game comes from a smoke/pet free environment.  I can provide pictures if needed, but besides the torn corners, this game is in excellent condition.  Hate to see this game go, but this classic hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seen the playtime it deserves.

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Parker Brothers, 1982 - Survive! - COMPLETE. Outer box is in acceptable condition with the usual shelfwear (particularly in the corners). Cover has (3) taped corners and a crease in the top right corner (about 2.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length).  Interior contents are in very solid condition (see upclose picture for more detail). Board still very vibrant with solid colors.  Bottom box has similar shelfwear with a crease in the bottom right corner (about 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length) a crease in the top center (about 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length) and a small bit of price tag residue (about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 0.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 4 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon

Box is pretty beat up. Missing one sea serpent, and I have an extra shark. Or maybe it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the other way around.
No matter. The game is well-loved, and in a very playable condition. </notes>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG2 002)
Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.
An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.

    <notes>Hi,
Game is in great condition. The glossy board as a few marks only visible when held at the right angle from moving game pieces about, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only to be expected.
All pieces and rule book in good condition.
The box has a slight tear on the side. Please see photograph for detail.
Hoping to find the little guy a good home.

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG2002A)
An underwater volcano has erupted and the island of Atlantis is sinking into the sea! Unless the Explorers escape in time all will be doomed! In Survive, you try to lead your Explorers from the sinking central island of Atlantis to the safety of one of four islands nearby. Your Explorers can get there quickly by boat (if they find one) or more slowly by swimming. But it will be a perilous journey as they must avoid Sea Serpents, Whales, and Sharks! When the volcano on Atlantis explodes, the game is over. The player with the most Explorer points wins. Survive has sold about 1.5 million copies world-wide in its previous versions, but was out of print for over 10 years. Now in this 30th Anniversary Edition, all of the components have been upgraded to the highest-quality levels, including slotted wood boats to carry the Explorer tokens, as well as Land Tiles of 3 different thicknesses to give Atlantis a 3-D look! </notes>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG2002A)
 An underwater volcano has erupted and the island of Atlantis is sinking into the sea! Unless the Explorers escape in time all will be doomed! In Survive, you try to lead your Explorers from the sinking central island of Atlantis to the safety of one of four islands nearby. Your Explorers can get there quickly by boat (if they find one) or more slowly by swimming. But it will be a perilous journey as they must avoid Sea Serpents, Whales, and Sharks! When the volcano on Atlantis explodes, the game is over. The player with the most Explorer points wins. Survive has sold about 1.5 million copies world-wide in its previous versions, but was out of print for over 10 years. Now in this 30th Anniversary Edition, all of the components have been upgraded to the highest-quality levels, including slotted wood boats to carry the Explorer tokens, as well as Land Tiles of 3 different thicknesses to give Atlantis a 3-D look! </notes>

Condition listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; because it has some damage on the box lid near the side/corner/top.  I consider it to be minor, as the box is sturdy and the picture is unaffected, if you would like a picture - PM me.  All of the components are complete and in like new condition.

An underwater volcano has erupted and the island of Atlantis is sinking into the sea! Unless the Explorers escape in time all will be doomed! In Survive, you try to lead your Explorers from the sinking central island of Atlantis to the safety of one of four islands nearby. Your Explorers can get there quickly by boat (if they find one) or more slowly by swimming. But it will be a perilous journey as they must avoid Sea Serpents, Whales, and Sharks! When the volcano on Atlantis explodes, the game is over. The player with the most Explorer points wins. Survive has sold about 1.5 million copies world-wide in its previous versions, but was out of print for over 10 years. Now in this 30th Anniversary Edition, all of the components have been upgraded to the highest-quality levels, including slotted wood boats to carry the Explorer tokens, as well as Land Tiles of 3 different thicknesses to give Atlantis a 3-D look! </notes>

Two of the yellow meeples in the base set are slightly marked, and one of the yellow meeples in the 5-6 player expansion is missing.  (I use the blue, red, white, and green sets, as I only play 4-player.)  Otherwise all components are present and correct and in excellent  condition.
There is no insert (to accommodate the expansions), but I have made foamboard compartments to store everything.
Shipping will be £3 within the UK.  (I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship this one overseas as it is quite heavy.)
