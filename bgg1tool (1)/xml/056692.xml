If the number of the card you just played is less than the line length, you may receive the excess cards (counting from last played to the first of the line).

Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, players choose two cards to add to his or her point piles.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4065)
The parade has started in Wonderland. Everybody is dressed up, the streets are decorated, excitement is in the air. Let’s find more people to join the parade. You are one of the organizers of the parade and are constantly trying your best to encourage people to join. If only the people already taking part didn’t leave so early... After a short while they just lose any interest in the parade. And if somebody shows up with the same dress or of higher rank, all they do is to leave the parade immediately and complain to you. You just want everybody to have fun, but why is that so difficult?

    <notes>Zman Games - Parade
Language: English
Players: 2-6
Age: 10+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.120 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The characters of Alice in Wonderland are having a Parade! All players are producers of this parade. Characters from Lewis Carroll_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s books such as Alice, The White Rabbit, and The Mad Hatter are steadily invited to join this weird procession. On your turn, you play a card (from your hand of five) to the end of the parade. Unfortunately, that card might cause other cards to walk off the parade. These cards will count as negative points in the end. The length of parade line is important. If the number of the card you just played is greater than the line length, you may receive the excess cards (counting from last played to the first of the line). But you do not take all cards, only the cards that meet one of these requirements: color is same as just played, or number is same or lower than just played. The game ends when all cards are played or when one player has collected all six colors in their point piles. Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, they choose two cards to add to their point piles. The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner. Scoring: Normally, negative points are same the number on the card. But if you have the most cards in a certain color, each of your cards of that color counts only 1 negative point!Thus, play your cards well!

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4065)
 
The parade has started in Wonderland. Everybody is dressed up, the streets are decorated, excitement is in the air. Let’s find more people to join the parade. You are one of the organizers of the parade and are constantly trying your best to encourage people to join. If only the people already taking part didn’t leave so early... After a short while they just lose any interest in the parade. And if somebody shows up with the same dress or of higher rank, all they do is to leave the parade immediately and complain to you. You just want everybody to have fun, but why is that so difficult?

    <notes>I am having clear out of games that my wife isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keen on (my main game playing is with her).
All components are present and in the original game box. 
There is hardly any wear, as we have only played a couple of times.
The price for second class postage in the UK is £2.50, if you buy any of my other items at the same time I will reduce the postage.
I do not want to post the game abroad and I only accept payment by Paypal.
Thanks
Martin

For Drunkenping
*PLEASE READ*
I am sending a Marketplace order for each item. If you have won multiple games, you will get multiple orders. You can purchase each one individually or wait to purchase them all at once. This will not change shipping cost. All combined shipping orders will be exact cost. If you won only one item you will pay the listed shipping cost as described in that item.

    <notes>This game has been played a dozen times.
This game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards have been sleeved.
The games box has some shelf wear. The insert is gone as it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit sleeved cards.
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>
