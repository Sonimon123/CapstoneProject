   <description>In the northwest corner of Nunavut, Canada, a formerly inaccessible bay off of the Arctic Ocean has become reachable through a secret inlet. Untouched by the hands of time and fed by both the ocean and warm fresh water springs, Ridback Bay is teeming with sea life. A remote, timeless bayside village is now being inundated by entrepreneurs awaiting the influx of the world's greatest fisherman to harvest this plentiful bounty. The docks and warehouses are being revitalized, and now it is time to begin the real adventure. Go build your Fleet and become master of the high seas!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fleet is an exciting, strategic card game with in-depth decisions and thrilling game play that new and experienced gamers can enjoy! In Fleet, you'll acquire licenses, launch boats, and fish the great briny blue. The player who best manages his resources and acquires the most VP via fish, licenses, and boats will build the strongest fleet and lead his crew to victory!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Played only once, perfect condition.  In addition to the cubes that the game comes with, I have the custom wooden fish meeples through the Kickstarter.  I also have every promo card: Inuit Fisherman, Salvage Yard, Salty Captain, and Nunavut Weather Authority.  So with this one purchase you get everything you can have for this game!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $6.50 with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition; just opened and played gently thrice in smoke- and pet-free home.  Includes Kickstarter promos: the promotional cards Salty Captain x 8, Inuit Fisherman x 8, Nunavut Weather Authority x 3, Wharfside Casino x 3, Salvage Yard License x 4, and a big wooden _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fleet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; die, and an additional booklet about the promotional cards.
SHIPPING:
   USA: $9.50 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101380N)
In the northwest corner of Nunavut, Canada, a formerly inaccessible bay off of the Arctic Ocean has become reachable through a secret inlet. Untouched by the hands of time and fed by both the ocean and warm fresh water springs, Ridback Bay is teeming with sea life. A remote, timeless bayside village is now being inundated by entrepreneurs awaiting the influx of the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest fisherman to harvest this plentiful bounty. The docks and warehouses are being revitalized, and now it is time to begin the real adventure. Go build your Fleet and become master of the high seas! Fleet is an exciting, strategic card game with in-depth decisions and thrilling game play that new and experienced gamers can enjoy! In Fleet, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll acquire licenses, launch boats, and fish the great briny blue. The player who best manages his resources and acquires the most VP via fish, licenses, and boats will build the strongest fleet and lead his crew to victory! </notes>

A remote, timeless bayside village is now being inundated by entrepreneurs awaiting the influx of the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greatest fisherman to harvest this plentiful bounty. The docks and warehouses are being revitalized, and now it is time to begin the real adventure. Go build your Fleet and become master of the high seas! Fleet is an exciting, strategic card game with in-depth decisions and thrilling game play that new and experienced gamers can enjoy! In Fleet, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll acquire licenses, launch boats, and fish the great briny blue. The player who best manages his resources and acquires the most VP via fish, licenses, and boats will build the strongest fleet and lead his crew to victory!</notes>

    <notes>I really wanted to play this game, but with only 2-players most of the time I just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this would work because of the auction.  I think this is the 2nd edition - the box says 2014 and it is the kickstarter box that fits everything.  I removed the outer shrinkwrap to include all of my extras (since I am not familiar with the game, I am not even sure of all of the extras that I have), but most of the cards are still shrinkwrapped (the only cards not shrinkwrapped are the Wharfside cards and what I think is a deck from the original game) and the game has never been played.  I have the blue fish meeples and the crab meeples.  This also includes the Arctic Bounty expansion, the Arctic Bounty promo cards, the promo cards of Salty Captains, Inuit Fisherman, Nunavut Weather Authority, Wharfside  Casino (I think there is actually 2 copies of this expansion - I bought one and I think one copy is in the kickstarter that I got) and the Salvage Yard expansion.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.

    <notes>This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play. All of the game components (cards, counters, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game twice but always with care, on a green baize cloth. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.
Note: I also have Fleet Arctic Bounty (unplayed) for sale at £12. I will sell them both together for £22 instead of £24 with one P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P obviously.
Packing and Delivery:-
