			<description>It's your lifelong dream &amp;ndash; to join the Star Patrol and be part of the crew of an interstellar Starship. You've worked hard, graduated from the academy, and received your first assignment as part of a team of young recruits, confident in your training and ready to be put to the test. Nothing can possibly go wrong as you are prepared for anything...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are the Space Cadets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space Cadets is a fun and frantic cooperative game for 3-6 players who take on the roles of Bridge Officers of a Starship. Each officer must accomplish his specific task in order for the team to successfully complete the mission. You might be the...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Helmsman, plotting the ship's course through asteroid fields and nebulae.  &lt;br/&gt;    Engineer, using dominoes to get enough power to each system.  &lt;br/&gt;    Weapons Officer, completing puzzles to load the torpedoes and flicking a disc down a track to launch them.&lt;br/&gt;    Shield Officer, using tiles to form poker hands to get the strongest shields.  &lt;br/&gt;    Sensor Officer, using your sense of touch to scan and lock on enemy targets.  &lt;br/&gt;    Captain, setting the plan and making sure that everyone stays focused and does their job.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your crew can work together to accomplish the mission goals, you just might make it home in one piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

				<notes>Never got this one to the table! I am attempting to reduce my game collection size and this game didn&#039;t make the cut.

This game, the rules, and box are in excellent condition.
