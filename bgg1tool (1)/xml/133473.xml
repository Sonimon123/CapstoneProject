   <description>In the super-fast sushi card game Sushi Go!, you are eating at a sushi restaurant and trying to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;draft and pass_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Never played. Might have the soy sauce promo available as well, though it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not compatible with this edition of the base game.
I will be in the US at the end of October and November (2018), so could ship from within the US or local pickup in Orlando/WDW area. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also be at Spiel on Thursday and possibly Friday (2018).
I ship worldwide, but PLEASE contact me before purchasing if you want to know the shipping costs.
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use Paypal, after being scammed a couple of times. Will only accept bank transfer or cash with local pick-up.
Afhalen is mogelijk in Dordrecht/Rotterdam op afspraak.
If you have any other questions, please contact me.</notes>

    <notes>Metal box is dented on front, but cards are just fine.
Cards are held together using Pastibands, which are made from a thin polyurethane plastic. They stretch like a rubber band, but won’t contract or degrade over time, and are archive safe.
Buyer pays shipping, which depends on distance from Massachusetts. Will ship by Priority Mail or Flat Rate box, whichever is cheaper. Combine purchase with some of my other games to save money on shipping.
Let me know if you have any questions. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to send more photos if requested.</notes>
