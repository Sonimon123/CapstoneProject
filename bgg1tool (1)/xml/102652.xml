   <description>A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;play themselves_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse! Sentinels of the Multiverse is the award-winning game in which players join forces as heroes to combat a dastardly villain in a dynamic environment! The Enhanced Edition features thicker card stock, a larger box, divider cards, tokens, and villain scaling mechanics, but the same great gameplay and mechanics that Sentinels fans know and love! </notes>

    <notes>Enhanced Edition with just about everything ever published for this game, all for one great price.  Everything is in perfect (like-new) condition -- most of the cards have never been used.  The only wear is some on the divider cards inside the box.  Includes enhanced edition box that fits all of the cards and then the Shattered Timelines box that holds the tokens and oversized villain cards.
Includes:
1) Enhanced Edition
2) Infernal Relics Expansion
3) Rook City Expansion
4) Shattered Timelines Expansion
5) Unity Hero mini-expansion
6) Ambuscade Villain mini-expansion
7) Miss Information Villain mini-expansion
8) The Scholar Hero mini-expansion
9) The Final Wasteland Environment mini-expansion
10) Silver Gulch Environment mini-expansion
11) Over-sized villain cards (for every villain)
If you buy this today from CSI, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay $67.40 not counting the base game which is currently out of stock (MSRP is $40 on that).  
In addition, you receive the following promo cards that are not readily available for purchase:
1) Eternal Haka Promo Card
2) Dark Visionary Promo Card
3) Vengeful Baron Blade Promo Card
4) Cosmic Omnitron Promo Card
5) Redeemer Fanatic Promo Card
6) Ra - Horus of Two Horizons Promo Card
7) Freedom Six Promo Pack (6 cards)
Finally, this includes an extra un-punched set of damage tokens.
In other words, you get everything ever published for Sentinels (the Vengeance expansion is not published yet) *except* the following: Young Legacy Promo Card, Rook City the Wraith Promo Card, and America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Greatest Legacy Promo Card.  That means you get everything other than these three hard-to-find promo cards (which give you alternate versions of the same heroes you do receive).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure of the value of the promo cards since none of them are currently for sale on the BGG Marketplace.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $15 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.  Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).</notes>

    <notes>Greater Than Games (GTG0001E)
A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse! Sentinels of the Multiverse is the award-winning game in which players join forces as heroes to combat a dastardly villain in a dynamic environment! The Enhanced Edition features thicker card stock, a larger box, divider cards, tokens, and villain scaling mechanics, but the same great gameplay and mechanics that Sentinels fans know and love! </notes>

    <notes>Greater Than Games (GTG0001E)
A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse! Sentinels of the Multiverse is the award-winning game in which players join forces as heroes to combat a dastardly villain in a dynamic environment! The Enhanced Edition features thicker card stock, a larger box, divider cards, tokens, and villain scaling mechanics, but the same great game play and mechanics that Sentinels fans know and love!</notes>

    <notes>Base game (enhanced edition) plus Rook City, Shattered Timelines, and Infernal Relics expansions. Everything is in the main box, no expansion boxes
Like new. I got these as part of a lot to get the two newest expansions and some promos... most of these cards look like they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never been used. Haka, Ra, Baron Blade and Megalopolis appear to be the only decks that have even been shuffled. The box is also pristine.
The box is packed full of cards, and it is heavy. Heavier then my 5 lb. scale can handle. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll call it 8 lbs for shipping estimates. I use USPS Priority, shipping from 04011. Medium flat rate will likely be cheapest unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the Northeast. Speaking of, local pickup is great if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re near Brunswick/Freeport Maine.</notes>

Bought a set through BGG to get some of the older promos; now, selling the excess. Good starter set to get you set up for the final expansions!
Includes the majority of Sentinels of the Multiverse. All cards are in near-mint/excellent condition, most decks appearing to never have been played, in penny sleeves. Two dividers (Scholar, Miss Information) are also missing. Contents Include:
- Base Game (Enhanced Edition)
- Rook City _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Infernal Relics
- Shattered Timelines 
- Vengeance
- Wrath of the Cosmos
- Hero Mini-Expansions (Unity, The Scholar, Guise)
- Villain Mini-Expansions (Ambuscade, Miss Information, Wager Master)
- Environment Mini-Expansions (Silver Gulch, Final Wasteland, Omnitron IV)
- Extra token pack
- Custom mat to track hero/villain health
Contents are stored in the Sentinels/Vengeance boxes. Shattered Timelines box not included
(Please note: Factor in a $30-$40 for shipping costs due to weight)</notes>

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - Sentinels of the Multiverse - has been unwrapped, opened, and only played once. Basically, this means that the condition of the game is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/chidentity ...</notes>

    <notes>**PLEASE READ FOR CLARIFICATION**
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling Sentinels of the Multiverse AND its four expansions together. 
The base game is $15 and the four expansions is $30 all together which brings the total to $45 before shipping.
Shipping within the United States should be $20 flat for the two game boxes and all the content.
Total: $65 for shipping within the U.S. 
INCLUDES:
Sentinels of the Multiverse: Base Game, 2nd Edition
Sentinels of the Multiverse: Rook City (Expansion)
Sentinels of the Multiverse: Infernal Relics (Expansion)
Sentinels of the Multiverse: Shattered Timelines (Expansion)
Sentintels of the Mulitverse: Vengeance (Expansion)
Sentinels of the Multiverse: Unity Hero Character (Single Hero Promo)
Bonus stuff I made which are included: 
6 health dials I made (See Pictures) that are very useful for keeping track of HP. I never play without them. 
2 Villain alternate character villain sheets (Baron Blade, Omnitron) (See Pictures)
About 20 promo cards I printed out and slipped into sleeves for the base character cards. 
The sleeves work well since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just the powers that you need to see. Such as: 
Knyfe 
Bunker x 2
Tachyon x2
Absolute Zero
Tempest
Legacy x 2
Visionary
Expatriate
Setback
Nightmist
Wraith x 2
Unity x 2
Haka
Ra
Fanatic
Lightly played. Smoke free home. 
I only have the boxes for the original Sentinels 2E box and Sentinels: Vengeance box as seen in the pictures. All the content fits into the two boxes. 
Feel free to message me with any questions.</notes>
