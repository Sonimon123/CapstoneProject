   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Waterdeep, the City of Splendors _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings. In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; or help _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed.  At the end of 8 rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Waterdeep, the City of Splendors – the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings. In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force!
In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder – or help – the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans.

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC388510000)
Waterdeep, the City of Splendors - the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings. In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force! In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder - or help - the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans. </notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC388510000)
Waterdeep, the City of Splendors - the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings. In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force! In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder - or help - the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans. </notes>

In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder - or help - the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans. </notes>

The game has been played twice by two very careful adults. It is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;as new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
I will send this game to the eventual buyer using a courier delivery service.
 To most mainland UK destinations the p _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; p cost will be £6.50. Some more remote areas will cost a little more.
I will not send this item to destinations outside of the UK. Postage charges otherwise are far too expensive.

    <notes>Lords of Waterdeep includes the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion and the Rapid Expansion Promo Card.  Everything is in the main box and I no longer have the expansion box.  The cubes have been replaced by DnDeeples and the game has the Broken Token insert.  It also includes extra dividers for the insert.
The game is in excellent condition.  The green player is missing a building-ownership token but that shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really be a problem.  It is the very, very rare occasion that all of them are needed.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never seen it happen.  
Buyer will pay shipping.  Shipping in the US will go through USPS and we can figure out the cheapest method.  I will ship anywhere in the world, but that can get rather pricy, and I will require insurance and tracking.</notes>

    <notes>***PLEASE NOTE: This entry is only valid for BGG user atticusfinch1960. Orders placed by any other user will be rejected.***
This order includes both the Lords of Waterdeep base game and the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion. Rulebook and components are in great condition. Please note, the box insert is not included for the base game (I threw it away so that I could fit all the components from the base game and from the expansion in one box). The insert for the expansion box is included.
Buyer is expected to prepay via PayPal and payment is expected within 72 hours of the purchase date. Will ship via USPS and will provide tracking.

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC388510000)
Waterdeep, the City of Splendors - the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings. In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city. Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force! In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city. Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder - or help - the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans.</notes>

    <notes>This copy includes the Scoundrels of Skullport expansion, however everything is in the expansion box (sturdier build, the base game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box was nice looking, but thin cardboard and sagged quite a bit).
This game is like new, everything is in plastic bags (and resources are in cotton bags) and cards are sleeved.

I will ship via USPS, Fed Ex, or UPS at my discretion. Based on the box size, shipping will be $16.</notes>

    <notes>INCLUDES Scoundrels of Skullport expansion.  Main game box only.  No insert.  Cards sleeved.  Complete and in excellent shape.  Played about 4-6 times.
Buyer pays for actual insured shipping costs.  Fees and supply costs are built into my price.  No idea if it will fit flat rate, but I think it might.
I will take bitcoin, Walmart gift certs, Amazon gift certs, cash in person, and Paypal.
International buyers may purchase my game, but you must pay me in bitcoin or gift certificates.  I will ship any way you desire but I take no responsibility for the package once it leaves my hands.</notes>

    <notes>This is in excellent condition and includes the expansion as well as the D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D-eeples, replacement skulls, and some unbelievably sweet metal coins that look like the real thing. The flimsy box has the dishing that is so common with this game, but the contents are excellent and cards are sleeved.  Domestic shipping is $18. Shipping to Canada is $60. All other international locations is $75 . I ALWAYS combine shipping on multiple purchases at +$1 per item.</notes>
