   <description>Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ziggurat expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Some versions of Tigris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Euphrates is part of what is considered Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I am selling this game because I realized I just wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t into the level of abstraction involved. The game is in absolutely like new condition - the only difference between this copy and one you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d buy in shrink is that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been opened, punched, and bagged according to what each player needs. I think there may be a player-aid printout in there as well. I have not played the game at all. The box is in excellent shape, as are all the other components. 
When I ship it, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pack the inside well with paper and stuff to minimize shipping movement. </notes>

Tigris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Euphrates: Double Scenario Edition
Culture, Conflict, Civilization
This revised edition contains a new 2-sided game board, 4 new civilization buildings, and a new advanced scenario!
Step back to the dawn of recorded time. Take command of a young dynasty in fertile Mesopotamia. Here, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, lies the cradle of civilization. Here, as the Bible tells, rose man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s first cities: Ur, Nineveh, and fair Babylon.
Play a part in the epic saga of the rise of these great urban centers. Guide your dynasty to develop and control the most vibrant culture in the rich land between the two rivers. Create the best balance between markets, temples, settlements, and farms. Forge your own new civilization and dominate the rich valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates.

    <notes>Tigre _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Euphrate (version Française de 2004)
Il y a des milliers d_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;années, en Mésopotamie, région fertile entre 2 rivières, le Tigre et l_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Euphrate, une nouvelle civilisation naissait. Les dirigeants de la plupart de ces petits royaumes indépendants se considéraient comme les représentants de Dieu sur terre et créérent les premières civilisations. Les marchands sumériens développèrent les principes de base de l_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;écriture cunéiforme avant même les Egyptiens. Les payasans de ces régions inventèrent vraissemblablement la roue afin d_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;amener leurs récoltes en ville.
Essayez de développer votre civilisation de manière constante et égale (Si besoin au détriment des autres joueurs). Pour y parvenir vous disposez de 4 dirigeants, le Roi, le Prêtre, le Fermier et le Marchand. Grâce à eux transformez vos petites villes en vastes royaumes. Mais n_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;oubliez pas que le bassin fertile n_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;est pas assez grand pour tout le monde. Les démonstrations de forces et les révoltes sont à l_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ordre du jour. La seule manière de survivre est de se développer de manière équilibrée. Utilisez vos dirigeants pour faire croître simultanément tous les aspects de votre société. Une bonne planification est indispensable afin de laisser une trace de votre dynastie dans l_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;histoire.
Jeu de Reiner Knizia pour 2 à 4 joueurs à partir de 12 ans. Durée 90 minutes.

    <notes>Top Licence Games - Eufraat _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Tigris (Tigre _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Euphrate)
Language: Dutch _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; French
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 12+
Duration: about 90 min
Weight: 1.830 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s masterpiece, the game is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.

    <notes>Per BGG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s rating system, I rated this game as Very Good since it has been punched. The game is complete and has only been played once. (I have seen other people list games in this condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.)
The pieces are punched, and the temples have been assembled. 
Only two of the screens have been used, so two of them are still completely flat. 
The box is in the same condition it was in when we got it at the game store, except for the lack of shrink wrap (it has very minor shelf wear). There is a crease in the quick start rules (more accurately, the sheet is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; at the top) but it was that way when we opened the shrink wrap.
As is standard with BGG Marketplace, shipping is extra. Shipping is currently running around $14 in the U.S. but over $30 to Europe. (The game is heavy.)</notes>

    <notes>Comments:
I have two copies of the much-sought-after HiG edition with the artwork that most people prefer. English rules from Mayfair but the box is the original German from HiG..  This offer is for the one that is open.  LMK if you are interested in the one that is unopened.
Condition Notes:
Still in shrinkwrap.
No longer in shrink, but still unpunched or unused.
Played once and in good shape.
Cover/backcover has some discoloration and/or shelfwear. Cover has some stress marks at the staples. Looks unread and unused. The map insert or title page has a small name/address stamped in a corner. Pages are clean. Map(s) are unmarked. Spine shows signs of wear. Staples show some signs of rusting.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

    <notes>This is the Hans im Glueck first edition from Germany. Rules are in German, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including an English translation of the rules. Other than the rules and box, the game is language independent. Game components are in almost new condition. I applied a neat thin coat of varathane to the surface of the circular leader pieces to prevent the paint from chipping or wearing, a common problem with the first edition. Box has some slight wear around the corners, consistent with storage and there is slight wrinkling on the top. The box has no split or dented corners.</notes>

    <notes>Pristine condition, only played once, virtually no shelf wear. English Mayfair edition, copyright dates go up to 2003, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure exactly which printing it is. The board is single-sided.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>This is the Mayfair 1999 edition of the game. The game is complete and in near new condition (opened, tiles punched out but never played). This is a game I purchased after playing at a convention but have never got around to playing and now need a bit more space hence the sale. I package well to handle the postal services and only charge actual cost to send. Please ask if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This is the most recent Mayfair edition with the double-sided board and advanced scenarios.
The game is practically new--I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve removed the shrinkwrap, and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it. All pieces are pristine and unpunched. The screens have not been folded (they haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been touched). The box is new save for very light whitening on a few edges on the bottom. The only thing that this game has seen is life on the shelf, which is a shame. You can give it meaning! You can give it life!
Local pickup available in the D.C. area, shipping from 20815. Will be happy to provide an exact shipping quote for USPS Priority mail beforehand.

    <notes>Box is very good (top dished ever so slightly). A few of the wooden temples cracked or broke when we put them together.

    <notes>Opened from shrink in May 2015.  Played 2 times as a 2 player game.  Now I am selling.  Includes ziggurat expansion.
One issue, which the game came with out of the shrink is with a few of the wood pieces (monuments) that had to be assembled.  A few fit together fine but 2 were tight and cracked the wood pieces a bit (the green monuments, as pictured).  Not cracked through, nothing wrong or that affects play.  If they were to ever come apart a little wood glue would fix them.  One was so tight that I sanded two barely noticable surfaces to get them to fit together (red and black monument).  Most people probably would not notice these issues, but I want to make sure you know about any little issue so we can have a good transaction.
Trades also considered.</notes>

    <notes>I am offering a vinyl reproduction of the Nile 2 player board.  It measures 18.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the spaces for the tiles are an ideal size.  It will be shipped in a tubular container.  The board flattens out nicely after it has been placed on a flat surface.  Placing books on the boards helps to speed up the process.

    <notes>I am trying to make space on my shelves for more RPGs. The only way I am going to be able to do that is to sell some board games.
I will be charging roughly 50% of the Amazon price as the starting price.
I will ship but the buyer will pay the cost. I actually prefer UPS but I can go with another company if it is cheaper.
Most games are from Kickstarters and have expansions that you cannot buy anymore. In these cases I will add a comment to the entry.
I never played it but bought it at a board game flea market.  Excellent condition.  Appears to be complete.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete. In fact, it is still unpunched with exception to a few tokens that have fallen out of the sprew from being picked up. The game board is double-sided. There is almost no wear on the edges or corners of the box nor any of the instruction manuals. There is some crushing on the left box front. This would make a great addition to any collection! Offers welcome!</notes>
