_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tis’ the dawn of the 19th century; an age of science, superstition, and witchcraft. Howling fills the night as a full moon rises over the small, secluded village of Shadowbrook. Gruesome murders have become a daily occurrence and terror haunts the streets at night. An evil creature has taken up residence here and the countryside is engulfed by a tide of darkness. But all is not lost…not yet. A small group of heroic individuals, with the courage and strength to fight, have arrived in town. Some just passing through while others have come with a purpose; but all will be put to the test as they race to save this cursed town from falling into darkness. It will take a cunning mind and strength of spirit to determine who is friend and who is foe… to solve the mysteries and hunt the beast to its lair. But the secrets of Shadowbrook run deep.

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF 0201)
Tis_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; the dawn of the 19th century; an age of science, superstition, and witchcraft. Howling fills the night as a full moon rises over the small, secluded village of Shadowbrook. Gruesome murders have become a daily occurrence and terror haunts the streets at night. An evil creature has taken up residence here and the countryside is engulfed by a tide of darkness. But all is not lost... not yet.
A small group of heroic individuals, with the courage and strength to fight, have arrived in town. Some just passing through while others have come with a purpose; but all will be put to the test as they race to save this cursed town from falling into darkness. It will take a cunning mind and strength of spirit to determine who is friend and who is foe... to solve the mysteries and hunt the beast to its lair. 
But the secrets of Shadowbrook run deep. Gossip and rumors run rampant and these few Heroes may soon discover that they are outsiders here and this town is already so rotten from within there is little left to save.
A Touch of Evil, The Supernatural Game is a fast-paced game of fiendish creatures, dashing Heroes, and high-adventure. Each player takes on the role of a unique monster-hunting Hero, racing against time to stop the forces of darkness from claiming another foothold in the world of man. Only by investigating the town and building your Hero’s strength can you hope to hunt down the Supernatural Villain to his Lair and defeat him in an epic Showdown. Players can race Competitively to be the first to defeat the Villain and save the town, or they can work together Cooperatively to defeat a much stronger Villain.
Featuring a gameboard map of Shadowbrook and its surrounding countryside, eight Heroes to choose from, and four different Supernatural Villains to hunt; each with its own host of unique Minions and powers to drastically change the game. A Touch of Evil is designed to create an adventurous cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds.
So grab up your Wooden Stake, stuff some shot in that Musket, and hold onto your Tri-corn Hat; no one is safe from the creatures of the night and no one can be trusted - for inside everyone lies A Touch of Evil.</notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF0201)
Tis the dawn of the 19th century; an age of science, superstition, and witchcraft. Howling fills the night as a full moon rises over the small, secluded village of Shadowbrook. Gruesome murders have become a daily occurrence and terror haunts the streets at night. An evil creature has taken up residence here and the countryside is engulfed by a tide of darkness. But all is not lost...not yet. A small group of heroic individuals, with the courage and strength to fight, have arrived in town. Some just passing through while others have come with a purpose; but all will be put to the test as they race to save this cursed town from falling into darkness. It will take a cunning mind and strength of spirit to determine who is friend and who is foe...to solve the mysteries and hunt the beast to its lair. But the secrets of Shadowbrook run deep. Gossip and rumors run rampant and these few Heroes may soon discover that they are outsiders here and this town is already so rotten from within there is little left to save. </notes>

    <notes>Description:
A Touch of Evil, The Supernatural Game is a fast-paced game of fiendish creatures, dashing Heroes, and high-adventure. Each player takes on the role of a unique monster-hunting Hero, racing against time to stop the forces of darkness from claiming another foothold in the world of man. Only by investigating the town and building your Hero’s strength can you hope to hunt down the Supernatural Villain to his Lair and defeat him in an epic Showdown. Players can race Competitively to be the first to defeat the Villain and save the town, or they can work together Cooperatively to defeat a much stronger Villain. 
 
Featuring a gameboard map of Shadowbrook and its surrounding countryside, eight Heroes to choose from, and four different Supernatural Villains to hunt; each with its own host of unique Minions and powers to drastically change the game. A Touch of Evil is designed to create an adventurous cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds. So grab up your Wooden Stake, stuff some shot in that Musket, and hold onto your Tri-corn Hat; no one is safe from the creatures of the night and no one can be trusted…for inside everyone lies A Touch of Evil.

    <notes>Cards are still sealed in plastic. Tokens punched, sorted in a Plano box (insert discarded). Unplayed, obviously.
Worse case shipping is $11.30. Cheaper if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the midwest or close-ish. I know how to get the best out of USPS rates (regional rate boxes, parcel select, etc.).
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I accept USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments, but your grand total will suffice to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after Paypal takes their fees out, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the transferred amount. So about $2 extra here.
I also accept ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price plus exact postage.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, then choose the option of send money to friends and family, NOT to purchase goods. Make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees.)</notes>

    <notes>Private listing for edrift101. Do not bid unless that is you.
This LOT of games is almost everything you can get for A Touch of Evil, and then some.
First off, the base game heroes are painted. Pictures upon request. I think they look nice, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m biased, because I painted them.
Second through Fifth - this includes the expansions:
Something Wicked
The Coast
Hero Pack 1
Hero Pack 2
All are virtually unplayed, except the base game. The cards are in good condition, and still have the sticky tackiness to them. 
This is a really fun game that I never got around to playing all the expansion material - so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m unloading it here. Hopefully it finds a good home.
Please figure an additional $25 for US shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship worldwide, but you pay the cost.</notes>

    <notes>This is a bundle including the following:
- A Touch of Evil core game (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35815)
- Something Wicked expansion (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/42047)
- Hero Pack 1 expansion (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/42902)
- Hero Pack 2 expansion (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/122241)
(Unfortunately, i do not have an extra copy of The Coast expansion to sell.)
These have been opened and unpacked but were never used. The cards, maps, tokens, and miniatures are all in like-new condition but the boxes have some minor scuffing along the corners, thus this sale is listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
i will reduce the price by 5 Euros if the buyer picks it up themselves (from Geltendorf, Germany), rather than having it shipped.
The package will be shipped from Germany via DHL and the weight is approximately 4.5kg. Shipping prices...
Within Germany: 7 Euros:
https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/preise/preise-national.html
The rest of the EU: 18 Euros

(use the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;up to 5kg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; column)
Full disclosure: i am not the original owner. i bought this second-hand (as a backup set) but have never used it. The original owner informed me that one card is missing (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Book of Riddles_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Manor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; deck) and one is duplicated (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Curse of Stone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;). It might be possible to get a replacement card from the publisher - i have never tried.</notes>

    <notes>Hi there and thanks for looking!
My listing for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;A Touch of Evil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; includes ALL boxed expansions as well as the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Madness_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Allies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card-based expansions! In addition This listing also includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Special Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Soundtrack (with cards) as well as the Delion Dryad(PNP), the Volgovian Nutcracker(PNP) and the Shadow Witch(PNP)!
If you are a fan of Flying Frog, than this is right up your alley! Jump in with both feet!!! This is a great game, but I have no more room of the shelf.
If you are new to their stuff then you should know that It`s an excellent game to play with friends and does a great job of introducing new people to the world of board games. This game can also be played solo and is a lot of fun!
All components are here and are in very good condition, and all cards are sleeved!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included images of all boxes, but can combine contents into fewer boxes (to save a bit on shipping) if so desired.
Please let me know if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to view any additional images.
Will ship pretty much anywhere. I can quote you shipping charges once I get your address. This will be heavy!!!
Again thanks for looking and feel free to ask me anything!
p.s If you live in Ontario, Canada... I can look into meeting you someplace (to save on delivery) if possible/practical.</notes>
