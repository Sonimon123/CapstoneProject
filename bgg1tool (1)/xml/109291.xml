   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sails of Glory is a series of games that recreates naval combat in the Age of Sails (1650-1815). Based on the game system used in Wings of Glory (formerly Wings of War), Sails of Glory uses miniatures, cards and board game mechanisms, with a special deck of maneuver cards representing the different movement capabilities of each vessel. The game will be supported by a range of painted and assembled 1/1000 miniatures._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players will choose their maneuver cards in secret, then reveal them all at the same moment. The card features arrows to be put in front of the miniature, then the latter is moved on top of the arrowhead. Several options on the same card are available depending on the wind and, with advanced rules, the sails used. After all ships moved, guns are fired from the sides of the miniature to targets in range._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Wings of Glory game system has been modified and expanded to accurately represent battles at sea between the large sailing ships of the past centuries. The first series of Sails of Glory will be set in the Napoleonic Age. If the game is successful, in the future Sails of Glory will be extended to cover other historical periods, such as the Age of Discovery, the Middle Ages and ancient times._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for a Lieutenant Level Pledge from the Kickstarter. (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1402889231/sails-of-glory-miniatures-ship-combat).
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Lieutenant - you will receive one copy of the Sails of Glory Starter Set, plus the four Kickstarter-Exclusive Ship Packs._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Lieutenant level pledges: free Game Mat, Attitude Indicator, Combat Ruler, Captain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Crew Ability Deck, Terrain Pack #1, Terrain Pack #2, two free sets of Smoke Clouds ($ 58 worth of rewards)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
It was shipped to me in two boxes: one with the game mat and one with everything else. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably have to ship it the same way because the game mat box is so long. So shipping will be for two packages from 78254. You can use http://postcalc.usps.com/ to estimate postage. Boxes are 3lbs and 8lbs.</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;England expects that every man will do his duty..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; -Admiral Nelson addressing his men at Trafalgar. In Sails of Glory you will sail and fight with massive ships-of-the-line or swift frigates, in an age where the armies and fleets of the French Emperor Napoleon I battled across the seas, as well as on the fields of Europe, and the powerful Royal Navy of the British Empire clashed against the French from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea, in dramatic naval battles, such as Trafalgar and the Battle of the Nile. This Starter Set is a complete game for 2-4 players, and also the entry point to a game system that allows players to recreate the epic naval battles of the of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Age of Sail_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Fast playing and easy-to-learn, Sails of Glory uses pre-painted and assembled ship miniatures and an innovative movement mechanic, inspired by the acclaimed system used in our Wings of Glory game. Four ships, two French and two British, are included, each ship complemented by a specific maneuver deck and ship log. Also included is a full color rulebook, counters, and accessories, to start playing out of the box in mere minutes.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game is from the original Kickstarter from 2013.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played it once and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in excellent condition, with some pieces still unpunched.  Box has minimal wear.  Instruction manual has minor signs of having been read.  
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know which of these were included in later editions of the game, if any, but it in any event includes these stretch goals from the original KS campaign (see photo):
- Laser-cut wooden attitude indicator
- Laser-cut wooden combat ruler
- 2-sided ship cards and ship logs
- Smoke cloud markers
- Captain and crew ability cards (sealed)
This game is too big for a Priority Mail flat rate box, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship Priority Mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is cheaper (or whatever you prefer).  Contact me for a quote.</notes>
