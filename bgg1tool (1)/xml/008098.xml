   <description>In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Jungle Jam, Медвед, and Prawo Dżungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee - Jungle Speed
Language: Dutch _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; French 
Players: 2
Age: 7+
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 0,290 kg
Theme: In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game. Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary. To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.

**
Jungle Speed was invented approximately 3000 years ago by the Aboulou Tribe in Eastern Trisopotamia to determine the shares of food each member received after a successful hunt. The Aboulous originally used eucalyptus leaves as cards for the game. These early games usually ended in bloody fights because, unfortunately, all of the cards were identical. This simple error nearly drove the tribe to extinction. This is why Jungle Speed remained unknown by the outside world until the 20th century, when 2 clever gamethropologists, Tom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Yako, replaced the leaves with the playing cards we now use today.
In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand - which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.
Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.
To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake - a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a Jungle Speed Free-for-all... Do you have the catlike reflexes and the eye of the hawk to win?

    <notes>Jungle Speed with heat-stamped emblazoned WOODEN TOTEM (for those gaming purists who are disgusted, disgruntled, and otherwise disenchanted with the newly included - but certainly not improved - yellow plastic Totem that resembles a dog_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s inexpensive chew toy and/or the cheap light wood version with the Jungle Speed ink-stamp).
 
Need I say more?
Okay I will...
-- Take a gander at these pics: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/888677/jungle-speed?size=medium AND http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/271234/jungle-speed
-- Wooden Totem is the very original totem (aka _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bois_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - means _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wood_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in French) that comes with the older European edition of the game and is emblazoned a.k.a. heat-branded with the Jungle Speed logo. NOT the plastic yellow totem, and NOT the cheap ink-stamped wooden version. This is the very classic dark wood logo-emblazoned version.
-- Safety helmets not included.
-- Game cards are still in shrink wrap
-- Original Packaging not available, BUT it does come with the original Carrying case.
-- Original French rules not available, BUT English rules downloaded and printed.
Other things that might interest you:
-- Aside from not having the original packaging, the game is in excellent condition. 
-- All pieces present and accounted for and meticulously stored and organized. 
-- Game was donated to a games library for students and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to use funds for other desired games. 
-- Game with Wooden Totem is very difficult to find in North America.
Shipping calculated based upon where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re located. Buyer pays actual shipping cost plus $3 packing costs. Tracking information will be provided for your peace of mind.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASM JS01US)
In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand - which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! 
Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary. 
To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a player into grabbing the Totem by mistake - a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a Jungle Speed Free-for-all... </notes>

    <notes>This game was acquired through the 2013 Dice Tower Kickstarter. The game is out of the box (currently stored in the cloth bag) and unplayed in a smoke-free home. The rule book may be slightly bent from being in the bag, but all the components are still top-notch condition. I will gladly pay shipping, which is why I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only shipping to the US.</notes>
