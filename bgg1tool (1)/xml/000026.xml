   <description>A game that is often described as a semi-sequel to Civilization._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players attempt to build up their cultures during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. The game features a card deck that holds events, payout cards, and famous leaders of the particular eras. Although all cards will turn up somewhere during the game, the timing and position in which they will be played is crucial and will ensure a different game every time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The main goal of each city-state is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once. An ingenious and very smooth working _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;combat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; system is implemented to determine province _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and thus resource - control._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I traded for this game on Boardgamegeek, dealing away my $100+ Battlefleet Gothic stuff.  However, my gaming friends are scared of this game, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;ll ever get to play it.  That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s the reason for selling.
All maps, gaming pieces have been counted and accounted for.  The only thing that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s bad about the game is the box cover with 3 split corners that has been taped.
Shipping to US is at LEAST $10 US depending on where you live.  I live in Vancouver.
Sorry, I can only accept Cheques.  You send the money, I wait for it to clear, and then I send you the product.</notes>

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE.
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address.
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price).
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 30 cents higher.</notes>

    <notes>I have marked this as Very Good as the lid is slightly sun-faded, and there are a few small marks and creases on the box.
However - this game is entirely unplayed. The counters are all bagged, the notepad has never been used, nor the deck of currency, and the mounted board is spotless. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never actually hit the game table for even one play session - and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s likely it never will. So I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather see it go to a new home where it will be appreciated.
If you have any questions, do please get in touch.

    <notes>I would rate this VG except Paris is missing one of the small square counters (there are 11 of 12 present). All other components here. Some of the player pad has been used but there are still plenty unused. Components are in nice shape with little wear. Box has moderate wear to the edges and corners, and two of the corners of the bottom have been repaired with tape.
$10 shipping inside the US. International shipping available but likely expensive ($50 or so). I accept Paypal, check, and MO. Let me know if you have questions.</notes>

    <notes>Box has a good amount of edgewear and dishing in the box bottom.  Many record keeping sheets remain.  Game materials are in good condition.
Game is complete, except this copy is missing 23 of the cards (I can send a list, but they are the 23 cards that have consistently been miscollated in many copies of this game).  I have color copied images of each of the missing cards and I also have corresponding image scans of the 23 cards as well, so it is quite possible to construct a sleeved deck of the proper deck.  Please ask if you have additional questions about this condition.
Shipping is $11 to Eastern and Central time zone and $13 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations, please inquire.</notes>

Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for 96oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>The box shows moderate shelf wear but the components are UNUSED. Cards still in shrink, money still wrapped, and counters unpunched. The log sheets are unused and even the player aid sheets are still attached together. The board is in perfect condition. 
As far as the box goes, the bottom is in pretty good shape. The top has whitening of the corners and some nicks here and there, but is sound and has no dishing. There is a sticky portion in the lower left corner of the box top that probably had a sticker at one point. There is also a Wizards of the Coast price sticker on the side next to the bar code. 
So the box is merely good or decent for something this old, but the components are in perfect unused condition.  
I will ship to the US using either priority or parcel post at your option. Local pickup in ZIP 06804 or 10589 through 4/8/15 or in ZIP 33716 after 4/13/15.</notes>

    <notes>Condition: This game is complete and undamaged. The box is in good condition, some aging and slight dishing on the top but otherwise fine. The contents are in excellent condition. All pieces and cards carefully bagged and banded. 
As an added extra, included are a set of Firmous_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fantastic advances cards printed on card stock using a high quality colour printer (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/2901/advances-english-ahpdf). If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never seen these I highly recommend them, they make keeping track of advances a lot simpler.</notes>

    <notes>There is moderate wear on the box with some dishing but structurally intact.  It is missing one red commodity token however, this does not affect play as there are more than enough in the game. All other parts are inventoried, meticulously bagged and in great shape.</notes>

    <notes>Game is UNPUNCHED. 
The cards and notes are opened, not in the original shrink (I did this to verify completness of the cards...the notes came without it IIRC. I put them in plastic to preserve them).
The box lid is OK although some edges deformation of having some games atop.
The bottom has little ding/crease.
The maps are perfect. They only have been opened twice. When I bought the game 20 years ago and today...they still resist to be opened.</notes>
