   <description>The Birth of America series continues with The American Revolution._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 1775: Rebellion, players take the roles of the American Continental Army and Patriots against the British Army and the Loyalists. Each side tries to control the colonies, provinces and territories. They call on the aid of Native Americans, as well as the German Hessians and French Army in order to successfully birth a revolution or quell the rebellion. The four factions each use their own deck of cards to move their units into positions. Battles are resolved quickly with custom dice. If you can control an entire colony, province or territory you raise a flag. When the game ends with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the side with the most flag markers is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1775: Rebellion uses the same basic mechanisms as 1812: The Invasion of Canada, but to a different end result. The game is quicker (being 2-4 player) and the intermingling of units at the beginning of the game allows the action to start immediately. There are a few core rules that changed in order to better portray the goals of the war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game also comes with an advanced scenario, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Siege of Quebec_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. We recommend this for players comfortable with the basic rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Winner of BGG _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Golden Geek 2013_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Award for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Best Wargame._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The year is 1775. The American colonies are outraged over new taxes imposed upon them by Great Britain. They begin to stockpile arms and organize militia. On April 18th, militia members ambush a column of 700 British Redcoats ordered to seize stockpiled arms. 273 British soldiers are killed or wounded before they reach safety in Boston. The American Revolution has begun! Now you and your friends command the armies of the British Redcoats, English Loyalist, German Hessians, American Regulars, Patriots, French Regulars and Native Americans to decide the fate of the Americas. Players from each faction cooperate to gain control of key towns and forts. Share the fun in this light and fast paced multi-player game! </notes>

The year is 1775. The American colonies are outraged over new taxes imposed upon them by Great Britain. They begin to stockpile arms and organize militia. On April 18th, militia members ambush a column of 700 British Redcoats ordered to seize stockpiled arms. 273 British soldiers are killed or wounded before they reach safety in Boston. The American Revolution has begun! Now you and your friends command the armies of the British Redcoats, English Loyalist, German Hessians, American Regulars, Patriots, French Regulars and Native Americans to decide the fate of the Americas. Players from each faction cooperate to gain control of key towns and forts. Share the fun in this light and fast paced multi-player game! </notes>

    <notes>Academy Games (AYG5375)
The year is 1775. The American colonies are outraged over new taxes imposed upon them by Great Britain. They begin to stockpile arms and organize militia. On April 18th, militia members ambush a column of 700 British Redcoats ordered to seize stockpiled arms. 273 British soldiers are killed or wounded before they reach safety in Boston. The American Revolution has begun! Now you and your friends command the armies of the British Redcoats, English Loyalist, German Hessians, American Regulars, Patriots, French Regulars and Native Americans to decide the fate of the Americas. Players from each faction cooperate to gain control of key towns and forts. Share the fun in this light and fast paced multi-player game!</notes>

    <notes>* This is a Like New copy. Some of the pieces have been punched and bagged, but remain look like they are unused (if they have been used, they have been treated well by the players. Other pieces  still remain unpunched  (see the photo for more details). 
* I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a longtime BGG member who must seriously cull my collection. 
* If you live in the US, this item fits into a USPS Priority Mail 2-Day™ Medium Box and ships for $13.65.  
* If you live outside the US, I will ship worldwide, but all shipping related expenses will need to be paid by you, including tracking, if it is not already provided by that service. The price depends on your location and the service you choose. USPS is the default service I use, unless you select something different. This item weights approximately 4.5 pounds (boxed for delivery) and ships from Zip Code 20852 
* I usually ship twice a week--on Wednesdays and Saturdays. If needed faster, arrangements can be made by contacting me.
