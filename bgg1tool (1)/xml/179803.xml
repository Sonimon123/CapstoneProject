   <description>Inferno is a standalone expansion to Arcadia Quest. It is 100% compatible with the original base game and introduces four new Guilds: Sharks, Tigers, Crows, and Serpents.  It features new types of heroes, such as Alchemists and Gladiators._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There is a new branching campaign system, and the storyline revolves around the guilds descending into a fiery abyss.  There are Brimstone cards that make the terrain risky to navigate, which operate similarly to the Tombstone cards from Arcadia Quest: Beyond the Grave._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A new mechanism called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Damnation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; will tempt the heroes with powerful weapons that can corrupt the characters over time or change the behavior of nearby monsters.  There are also Angels, which are allied characters for the heroes to rescue, escort or assist.  Working with the Angels can affect the branching campaign path system and even allow the player to recruit them for use in later missions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This bundle is a preorder for the KS version of Arcadia Quest Inferno. This includes the following items. I will ship it as soon as I have it in my hands. I received my tracking info already so it should be here soon. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll even throw in the classic guild bag and classic guild tokens. Depending on where you live shipping can be high, the boxes are coming in at 12 and 14 lbs! Just wanted to give a heads up, this is coming from Forest Hill Maryland. I will keep this up here for a few more days before going the way of Ebay, would rather it go to a gamer which is why the price is low. Message me for a quote on shipping.

    <notes>New and unplayed Kickstarter edition (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hell of a Pledge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) that includes the Poison Dragon and Whole Lotta Lava as well as any other stretch goals (that are not add-ons).  Buyer to pay shipping from 94590.  Note that these items will NOT fit into a priority mail flat rate box and that shipping is likely to exceed $35.  I may be able to fit the items into 2 medium flat rate boxes, though.  If you have questions about this, let me know.</notes>
