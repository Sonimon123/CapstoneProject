   <description>Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used.

    <notes>I love this game but my friends won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play it with me.  This is a complete set of Summoner Wars.  In addition to the Master Set components it also contains the Phoenix Elves, Tundra Orcs, Cave Goblins, Dwarves, Vanguard, and the Fallen Kingdom plus all their army expansions.  I have 2 copies of each bonus Mercenary Hero and 2 additional chipboard play mats for a total of three game boards.  The original paper mats, rule books, wound counters and 15 dice are included.  All cards are sleeved.</notes>

Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.
The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:
 - Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!
 - Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!
 - Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!
 - Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!
 - Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!
 - Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!
Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.
Victory can come only from the death of your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Summoner...

Summoner Wars is the exciting card game of fantastic battlefield combat that puts you in the grandiose role of a Summoner. Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you. The Summoner Wars Deluxe Set contains 6 different complete factions to choose from. Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness! Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him! Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens! Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery! Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy! Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! </notes>

Summoner Wars is the exciting card game of fantastic battlefield combat that puts you in the grandiose role of a Summoner. Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you. The Summoner Wars Deluxe Set contains 6 different complete factions to choose from. Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness! Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him! Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens! Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery! Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy! Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! </notes>

    <notes>Plaid Hat Games (PLDSWMS)
Summoner Wars is the exciting card game of fantastic battlefield combat that puts you in the grandiose role of a Summoner. Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you. The Summoner Wars Deluxe Set contains 6 different complete factions to choose from. Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness! Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him! Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens! Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery! Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy! Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! </notes>

    <notes>This is a huge Summoner Wars lot for sale:
 Original Master Set (with the larger box and nice plastic insert and 2-part glossy board)
 All 16 Wave 1 factions (first Summoners). The 2 starter sets are the reprints, not the original 2009 editions
 All Reinforcement packs up to (but not including) Saella_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Precision: Goodwin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Blade, Hawk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Strike, Piclo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Magic, Taliya_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Spirit, Grungor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Charge, Rukar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Power, Bellor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Retribution
 2nd Summoners for Guild Dwarves, Vanguards, and Fallen Kingdom
 Promo cards: the 4 champion promos (Bogdan, Khexu, Khan Queso, Sairook).
 2 paper boards from the 2nd edition starter sets
Everything is in the original Master Set box. I do not have any boxes for the individual factions, reinforcement packs, or starter set reprints. No cards are sleeved but all are in excellent or unplayed condition (though all are opened and sorted in the great insert that came with the original Master Set). Of course I have all the dice and wound markers as well.
I have access to reduced-rate shipping at work, but this is a heavy box of stuff so shipping will be a little pricey (though still likely under $20 for anywhere in the US).
Local pickup always an option from ZIP 06804 or 10589.</notes>

    <notes>Plaid Hat Games (PLDSWMS)
Summoner Wars is the exciting card game of fantastic battlefield combat that puts you in the grandiose role of a Summoner. Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you. The Summoner Wars Deluxe Set contains 6 different complete factions to choose from. Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness! Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him! Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens! Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery! Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy! Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!</notes>

    <notes>This listing is not for the game but for the PERFECT FIT sleeves to protect your factions!
Each pack contains 100 Premium Swan Panasia Sleeves (I have up to 25 packs to sell...just adjust the quantity wanted at checkout): 
The sleeves are the high quality premium thick Swan Panasia sleeves. At 60mm x 90mm, they are arguably the only sleeves on the market to perfectly fit this game and will protect this collection for years to come!
Here is the link to the sleeves you will be receiving: http://swanpanasiasleeves.com/swan-prem-card-sleeves-60x90-mm-chimera-100-per-pack.html
Note- There are roughly 1500 cards in everything that has been printed by PHG to date (15 packs of these sleeves will cover them). 
There will be roughly an additional 500 cards in the remaining 2nd Summoners to be printed in the near future. So if you want to plan ahead, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need 5 packs of these sleeves to cover them and will most likely have some extras in case you need/want them.
All packs are brand new and unopened!  Get them here for 50% off the retail price!!!
Comes from a smoke-free environment!
International buyers are welcome!</notes>

-Dice, Life, Markers, Setup Cards, Instruction manual
-2 playmats (the one that came with the master set and another)
I also think there are some reinforcement packs, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t guarantee that, as I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember if I bought them or not.
It is a sizable box, shipping will probably be somewhere between $12-15, but geekmail me your zip and I can give you a better estimate.
Cards are not sleeved, but are in excellent shape.  I will put stuffing in the box to make sure things don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t shift around too much.</notes>

    <notes>This game has never been played.  I removed the insert so that I could sleeve all of the cards with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Summoner Wars_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card sleeves.  All of the factions are individually bagged - the cards did not fit in the insert if they were sleeved.  There are also some extra sleeves that I have included in the box.  Unfortunately, after watching videos on how to play the game my husband thought it reminded him of Heroscape and he hated Heroscape.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

The game has never been played because I thought it would be something my wife would enjoy and discovered I was wrong. Hope you will enjoy this game!</notes>

    <notes>Opened but un-played. Cards all in shrink-wrap. Includes two extra factions (Elves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Grognark) in baggies) Item is in very good condition. Super minor dent alone box cover, barely noticeable. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags.  I ship via USPS, which is most cost effective. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. Shipping from 98012.
Here’s some shipping ESTIMATES to help you get an idea of what it will cost. Your distance from my Zip Code (98012) and box weight are the biggest factors in price. Please ask ahead of time if you want to know your shipping! If you place an order and cancel it after I provide you with shipping, you will get negative feedback. 
Small Card Game (i.e. 6 nimmt or Hanabi) $3-$6  / USPS First Class or Priority Bubble Mailer 
Thin Medium Sized  (i.e. Concept, Las Vegas) $8-$10 / Priority Mail
Thick Medium Sized (i.e. Istanbul, King of Tokyo, Russian Railroads) $10-$13 / Priority Mail
Big Box Games (i.e. Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders) $16-$18 / Priority Mail or Parcel Post
Oversized or Odd Shaped Boxes ($22-$25) / Parcel Post</notes>

    <notes>I have played the basic set, but list this as new because it contains other decks which remain un-opened. I will be glad to list these decks upon your inquiry.
Shipping will be roughly $10-15 dollars depending on weight and distance in the U.S. I use USPS. If you want it sent by other means please let me know.
I will send it world wide but it may cost more. 
Please be patient when I getting your shipping estimate. I work and so need some leeway about getting to the Post Office. If it expires I will re-list the game and let you know that you can buy it again with the known shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete. There is almost no wear wear on the edges or corners of the box or the instruction manual. There is no crushing on the box, though. There is a SKU sticker on the barcode of the box. 
The date on the box is 2011, but I cannot discern the difference between this and the 2012 version. If the difference matters to you, please contact me prior to purchase to help me determine which version I actually have for sale.
This would make a great addition to any collection! Offers welcome!</notes>

    <notes>Box has slight dishing on top and a few small scratches and other slight imperfections.  Although the manual says that the game comes with 225 cards, there are more than 350 cards or so in there, two packs are still in shrink wrap, along with 6 dice, manual, board and wound markers.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know anything about this game but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing that this is the master set plus at least a few additional packs.
The box is a little larger than typical so it will cost a bit more to ship.</notes>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not a regular size box, so no flat shipping will be available. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing the cost will be around 20 bucks to ship in the U.S. If you know a cheaper way than my quote, please let me know.</notes>

    <notes>This is all complete and a couple of decks have been played a maximum of twice. Most of the decks are opened but never played. Game components are in excellent condition. There is some slight compression in the middle of the lid from having had other games stacked on top of it, but it is hardly noticeable.</notes>
