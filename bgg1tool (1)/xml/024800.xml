   <description>Conflict of Heroes is a fast-paced tactical board game series that follows the development of modern day squad and platoon level tactics, starting with World War II and continuing all the way through modern day Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition and has only been played twice.  Cards were in sleeves.  This includes the swamp expansion board.
I prefer paypal payments but will also accept money orders.
This game will ship either USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion.
This game is an odd shape and is pretty heavy so shipping will be $15.00 with the increase in shipping costs this month.</notes>

Academy Games presents Conflict of Heroes, a new fast-paced tactical board game series designed by Uwe Eickert. The series follows the development of modern day squad and platoon level tactics starting with World War II through modern day Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! – Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s modern armies.
Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.
Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.
The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in 10 minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.
The game also features 3 to 4 multi-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.
Orders ship out within 1-3 business days with email notifcation and shipping/tracking information.

    <notes>Academy Games first printing of Awakening the Bear from 2008.
The game is not in shrinkwrap, but it is unplayed. All of the unit and support counters have been punched but are all accounted for (that took a while!).  They are currently located in the four cardboard holders that come with this version of the game.
The card deck has been opened. All of the cards have been accounted for.
Rules, firefights, player aid sheets and tracking charts are all present.  All five boards are present and in excellent shape.
The game box is in pretty good condition. There is the usual beginning signs of wear and tear around the corners of the box top and box bottom.  The game box top corners are scrunched in just a bit with the long sides starting to show signs of flaring out.</notes>

Also comes with a new Reference Rulebook and Summary sheet that was printed last year.
Price of Honour and The Marsh are still in shrink. The first two are out of shrink because I wanted to make sure they are still in great shape (they were sitting vertically on my shelf). They are all in excellent condition.

    <notes>Very gently played copy.  Nothing missing or damaged.  All counters have been neatly sorted and stored in ziploc baggies.  Box has no splits, dents, or dings.  Just to clarify: This is FIRST EDITION.  A second edition is already available so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering this one at a reduced rate.  If you want to try out the Conflict of Heroes system without spending a lot, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your chance.
P.S. I would recommend downloading the latest copy of the living rules for Academy Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s website.  </notes>

    <notes>I have a near-mint copy of Conflict of Heroes, Awakening the Bear! First Edition. It includes the Marsh Expansion. I will give it to whoever(in the US) wants it. You will just need to pay the USPS Priority Mail cost for me to mail it to you. This is NOT the current edition ... this one is the 2008 edition, but it works just fine when you print the current rules off the Academy Games website and use the replacement counters that come in the CoH Price of Honour Expansion.</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;job lot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  Three  boxed games and one expansion. Basically I am selling the Conflict of Heroes games together as one sale.
Awakening the Bear (1st ed)
Storms of Steel 
Price of Honour
Swamp map expansion.
I have had these games for several years and many of the units are punched and bagged and stored across the boxes (the Poland _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Price of honour_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; expansion is mostly unpunched. Everything is here, but mixed up, and it is too time consuming for me to sort through everything. This is an opportunity for Australian buyers to purchase %95 of the Conflict of Heroes system for very cheap.
The games are complete and in very good condition. The box for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Awakening the bear_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; is dished but intact, and as I stated everything - cards, counters maps, booklets - is in very good condition.
I am *not* going to sort through these and sell off individual games…as I said it is too time consuming and I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be bothered….I just want to off load the games. Please do not contact me if you wish to buy individual games. I am selling these as one.
direct deposit (preferred) or Paypal.

    <notes>Overall: G to VG
Box: G (top has flaring; bottom back has some minor wrinkles)
Bits: LN to N (cards have been removed from shrink; counters are unpunched and in shrink)
The box is out of shape but there is no actual damage to it.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care about that, then you should be happy with the overall condition of the game.
Note that the box states that there are 56 cards but there are actually 55 for this print run (55 is the correct number of cards).  See the wiki.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and punched but unplayed and unread. Verified complete.
Buyer pays shipping and insurance.
As payment method, I would prefer bank transfer. 
However, Paypal is possible if you add 5% to the total amount (to cover the fees).
Please ask for shipping costs, which is not included in the price.
If you want to be absolutely certain that a game will arrive safely, please ask me to send it registered since that is not included by default.
I usually create the shipping labels online, which generally need your e-mail and phone number.</notes>
