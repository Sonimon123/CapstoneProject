   <description>Carcassonne: The City is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series. Players build up the old town together by placing tiles. While the town area grows, the town walls grow around it, starting from a wooden gate. The wall is comprised of delicately carved wooden parts, that create a beautiful rendition of the medieval town at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Next to the slightly modified tile-laying rules, players have the possibility to place their followers as guards on the walls, offering them a wide view of the town. This brings the players extra points. Each player also receives between three and six cylindrical wooden towers (depending on the number of players), giving the town walls an added aesthetic effect._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game has never been played, only opened it and looked inside. All tiles still unpunched.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.30€ worldwide and 8.20€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Played a few times. Components are in excellent condition. Wooden box was water damaged, noticeable on back side. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look terrible in my opinion, just makes it look older. Also, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the slip cover that came with the game (seemed superfluous).
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If you order several games from me, I will combine shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Rio Grande Games second edition of Carcassonne: the City (the one in the normal cardboard box).
The game is still in shrinkwrap.  However, there is slight damage to the game box due to shipping.  The shrinkwrap is intact, but there are scrapes on the shrinkwrap along the box edges.  Along the right hand side of the box, there is a 1/16 to 1/8 inch bulge in the box.  And there is a small indent on the box bottom near the spot of the side bulge.
The box is intact.  No other damage to the box.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>I am having clear out of games that my wife isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keen on (my main game playing is with her).
This is the edition in the lovely wooden box and nice thick tiles.
All components are present and in the original game box. 
There is hardly any wear, as we have only played a couple of times.
The price for second class postage in the UK is £6 (The game is very heavy, about 1.3kg), if you buy any of my other items at the same time I will reduce the postage.
I do not want to post the game abroad and I only accept payment by Paypal.
Thanks
Martin

    <notes>*Wooden Box Edition*
Played once or twice and in great shape.
I generally don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like box inserts (unless they are REALLY good) so I ditched this one - but have everything in itemized zip-top baggies or similar.</notes>

    <notes>Carcassonne: Die Stadt ‐ German edition (2004) 
Note 1: I was counting the content.
The rule book says there are 70 walls  AND 2 short walls.
But the 2 short walls are included in the 70 walls. Ergo 70 walls total
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/623465/carcassonne-city-2nd-edition-component-review
Note2: The rules are in german and the rule paper / sheets are a little bit to big for the wooden box. So they are a little bit wavy.
Note3: The wooden box has a irregularity imprint, wooden grains.
But i think thats the normal case.

    <notes>All products are as described. If you have questions, please let me know.
Please take a look at all the games I have for sale. If you purchase multiple games, I am willing to ship them out together to save on shipping costs.
For international orders, I will only ship via Priority International Mail via US Postal Service. While more expensive, it allows for quicker, more reliable delivery and also includes insurance. Other shipping methods are cheaper, but unreliable in many parts of the world, after it leaves the US Postal Service.
Thanks for your consideration.

    <notes>[b]Condition:[/b] Very Good to Like New. Fully inventoried, components show no signs of wear, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this was ever played. The insert has a small dent in it, does not impact structural integrity. The box shows minor shelf wear (some whitening at corners/edges).
