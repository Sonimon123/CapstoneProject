   <description>Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak takes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand his game experience. In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Prison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re precious assets to any Zombicide team._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s even an alternate ending._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

A cooperative game of zombie hunters in a gloomy prison, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The world is at WAR against a hungry horde of ZOMBIES born from our own hubris. While most people chose to flee and became prey, WE chose to STAND and become PREDATORS. We are survivors, and we FIGHT against death itself with every weapon available. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to engage in... ZOMBICIDE!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, ages 13 and up. A game can last for 30mn (beginner board) to 4 hours (expert board). Each player controls between one (for 6 players) and six (solo game) survivors of different backgrounds and origins, all battling zombies in a prison and its surrounding areas. Through the missions featured in the game, your team tries to clean out the prison and make it into a safe haven. Good luck - you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re going to need it. Survivors must accomplish specific goals while constantly battling zombies and gaining new skills in the process. Be careful, however: the Danger Level rises with your experience, and the more zombies you kill, the more zombies come for you. In the end, swarms of zombies block your path to victory. Luckily, you have the will and the weapons to kill them all! Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak is designed both as a stand-alone game for new players and an expansion for Season 1 owners. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a fast-paced, fun, and easy-to-learn game with action movie characters and themes. Your team must develop innovative tactics to find the balance between survival against all odds and furious zombie hunting. Cooperation and friendship are your best tools to achieve victory. Engage in a Zombicide with your family and friends (ages 13 and up)! </notes>

Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £5.99 for this item.

    <notes>This is a lot of Zombicide stuff, which I no longer play with. Condition marked as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; because there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some minor box damage and some mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are painted - no components are damaged in any way. No components are missing (Unless a wizard has interfered since I last played).
Some bits are painted, which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll mention in comments (No promo survivors are painted)
Core Stuff:
Zombicide: Season 1 (Retail) (All base-game zombies are primed, I think about half are painted)
Zombicide: Season 2 (Kickstarter) (Mostly un-touched, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a painted toxic fatty and 3 painted berserker walkers).
Zombicide: Toxic City Mall (Kickstarter)
Zombie Dogs (Primed, Unpainted)
Companion Dogs (Primed, I think 2 are painted)
Survivors:
Brad, Will, Wanda, Don, Fred, Chuck, Rose, Rick, Raoul, Shannon, Achille, Gary, Mack, Smith, Frank, Rob, Watts, Kim, Thaissa, Joshua (Painted), Ned (Painted), Grindlock, Kirk, Derek, Ralph, Belle, Phil, Doug (Painted), Elsa, Josh, Amy, Neema _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mike.
All is contained in the Prison Outbreak and Toxic City Mall boxes with a foam-core insert I made.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to provide further images if you ask for it, just throw me a mail.
Shipping - First £15 free, if its_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; much more than that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ask you to pay the difference.</notes>

    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNGUG0016)
A cooperative game of zombie hunters in a gloomy prison, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The world is at WAR against a hungry horde of ZOMBIES born from our own hubris. While most people chose to flee and became prey, WE chose to STAND and become PREDATORS. We are survivors, and we FIGHT against death itself with every weapon available. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to engage in... ZOMBICIDE!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players, ages 13 and up. A game can last for 30mn (beginner board) to 4 hours (expert board). Each player controls between one (for 6 players) and six (solo game) survivors of different backgrounds and origins, all battling zombies in a prison and its surrounding areas. Through the missions featured in the game, your team tries to clean out the prison and make it into a safe haven. Good luck - you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re going to need it. Survivors must accomplish specific goals while constantly battling zombies and gaining new skills in the process. Be careful, however: the Danger Level rises with your experience, and the more zombies you kill, the more zombies come for you. In the end, swarms of zombies block your path to victory. Luckily, you have the will and the weapons to kill them all! Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak is designed both as a stand-alone game for new players and an expansion for Season 1 owners. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a fast-paced, fun, and easy-to-learn game with action movie characters and themes. Your team must develop innovative tactics to find the balance between survival against all odds and furious zombie hunting. Cooperation and friendship are your best tools to achieve victory. Engage in a Zombicide with your family and friends (ages 13 and up)! </notes>

This listing includes the following: Zombicide(2012), Zombicide: Toxic City Mall, and Zombicide: Prison Outbreak. 
This copy of the game has hit the table frequently but all components are in very nice condition with little to minor wear. All game components are neatly stored within two of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original boxes(Toxic City Mall and Prison Outbreak boxes). Unfortunately, I no longer have the original Zombicide(2012) box, it will not be included. 
Also, I am including several add-on/promo survivors in this bundle:
x1 Lea
x1 Thaissa
x1 Ivy
x1 Angry Mary
x1 Red Cap Ben
Please be sure to check out all of the pictures I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included of this listing!

    <notes>This includes the following items:
Toxic City Mall
Zombie Dogs
Companion Dogs
31 Extra Zombies (Kickstarter Bonus)
Extra spawn cards
Set of 6 Red dice
Set of 6 Orange dice
Everything is in the Base game box and Toxic City mall box. If you want to save on shipping, I can fit everything into the base game box.
Everything has been played, but is still in excellent shape. I had started to paint some of the toxic zombies. I have since cleaned them with simply green. Please see the pic above.
I will ship with whatever method you prefer. If you have any questions or would like some pics, please ask.</notes>
