   <description>What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mage Wars _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;zones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Extra copies of spells available with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Arcane Wonders (AWG1010)
What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard? Mage Wars pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts - all of this and more awaits you in the arena of Mage Wars! Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;zones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy. </notes>

    <notes>Arcane Wonders (AWG1010)
 
What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard? Mage Wars pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts - all of this and more awaits you in the arena of Mage Wars! Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;zones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy. </notes>

    <notes>Arcane Wonders (AWG1010)
What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard? Mage Wars pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts - all of this and more awaits you in the arena of Mage Wars! Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;zones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy. </notes>

    <notes>Thanks for clicking. A long story short, I received an extra, non-returnable copy of the Mage Wars base game as a gift--although it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a fabulous game, I have no need of a second full set! As such, picking it up from me will not only help you snag a great game at a bargain price but also help a fellow CAG clear some much needed shelf space.
As noted, this copy is completely brand new, has never been opened, and comes from a non-smoking, no pet home. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover the shipping via USPS parcel post (with tracking information) as long as you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the continental US.
Thanks so much for your interest!</notes>

    <notes>Thanks for your interest in this listing! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m clearing out space in our new apartment and the next game on the list to go is my Mage Wars collection. Specifically, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m hoping to sell in a single bundle:
 
*One (1) copy of the Mage Wars base game
 *One (1) copy of the Core Spell Tome expansion
 *One (1) copy of the Core Spell Tome 2 expansion
 *One (1) copy of the Forcemaster v. Warlord expansion
 
Everything has been opened, is complete and has been gently used by an adult in a non-smoking, no pet home. I plan to ship everything other than the boxes for the two core spell tomes (which are small, flimsy, not necessary for storing your components and have been crushed).
 
In terms of pricing, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $65 for the total bundle, shipping included! I should be able to ship the bundle out within 48 hours of payment.
 
Thanks again for your interest!</notes>

    <notes>You may be thinking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;$149 for Mage Wars? Steve_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s outta his mind._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; When you see what all is in this auction, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll realize it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s actually quite a deal!
So, what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in it?
- Mage Wars Core Set. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played a couple times, but everything is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; The cards that were used were sleeved for play.
-- It also includes two extra spell books (brown and red.) The ones I originally received were _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;bubbly,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; so Arcane Wonders sent me replacements and allowed me to keep the originals.
-- There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also two copies of the revised rule book, in addition to one copy of the original printing rulebook.
- Core Spell Tome 1. Opened and incorporated into the Core Set cards.
- Core Spell Tome 2. New in Shrink.
- Forcemaster vs. Warlord. Opened but unpunched/unplayed.
- Druid vs. Necromancer. New in Shrink.
-- also includes two preorder promo cards: Altar of the Iron Guard and Plagued.
Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this purchase apart: one of each of the three Organized Play Kits, in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition! Each comes with an Event Guide, Story Guide, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;How to Teach Mage Wars_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; booklet, poster, folder, and most importantly, FOIL-STAMPED PROMO CARDS! All of the cards from these kits are still New in Shrink!
- Kit 1: Dark Prophets. Includes 24 cards, 8 copies each of Minor Heal, Dispel, and Galador
- Kit 2: Allegiance in Blood. Includes 36 cards, 8 copies each of Asyran Defender, Wand of Healing, Stumble, and Sersiryx, Imp Familiar
- Kit 3: Unholy Tides. Includes 36 cards, 8 copies each of Altar of Peace, Clear Mind, Mordok_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Tome, and Oscuda.
Now, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the craziest part: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling all this for what I paid for it! If you price out all the retail products at an online retailer, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see they total over $120 (and seeing that the base game has been played, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m valuing my set $20 below online prices. The Play Kits cost me about $16 each.
If I were so inclined to sell individual cards, I could probably make over $100 selling the promo cards alone. But that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not me. I hope that this set goes to a game group that loves the game (my town is just too small for it to catch on.) If 8 people were to split this set, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay just over $18 each to get 11 promo cards each, as well as have a whole game set for a new player! Or seven people could pay $10 each and get one of each promo card, and the eighth could pay $79 for a great deal on the retail stuff, and get a set of promo cards, too! Anyway, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s for the buyer(s) to figure out. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just trying to make it clear that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just hoping to recoup some of my cost rather than profit on promos.
All that said, this box is heavy and shipping will likely be $25+. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know exact shipping after you confirm your purchase--available options will include USPS, FedEx, UPS, or even local pickup. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also require it to be insured.
Check out the other items in my Marketplace!
I combine shipping! 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll entertain reasonable offers for purchasing multiple items.</notes>

    <notes>This is the base game with no expansions. It has been opened and sorted but never played. Excellent condition. Please note that even though my asking price is only $20, this is a fairly heavy game box due to all the cards, so ground shipping is likely to cost somewhere between $15-$25 depending on where you are. Thanks for your interest.</notes>

    <notes>Arcane Wonders (AWGMWCS2015)
Mage Wars is the customizable strategy game of dueling mages. Players take on the role of powerful mages, stepping into the arena to battle for supremacy. Mage Wars is a unique genre-breaking concept, combining the best elements of customizable card games and tactical miniature games. Players can play as a Wizard, Warlock, Beastmaster or Priestess; each with their own unique strategies and style of play. The game is fast-paced and exciting, with tough tactical decisions every turn. Players build their own custom spell book, with over 300 spells to choose from! The game is not collectible - players have equal access to the same spells. There is no random card drawing - players choose exactly which spells to cast, when they want to cast them! This allows for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Summon powerful creatures into the battle, hurl lightning bolts and fireballs, adorn yourself with mighty weapons and armor, or lay a network of hidden enchantments to take your foe by surprise. All of this and more awaits you in the arena of Mage Wars! With subtle strategies and diabolical surprises, the balance of power can shift each round, keeping the game exciting and victory unpredictable.</notes>

One box corner is slightly bumped which is how it was originally shipped to me but I would consider that cosmetic.
All cards are sleeved. Has been played only once. Both spellbooks are still in wrap.  
Shipping to UK addresses will be £5.95 (with MyHermes standard).

    <notes>In order to reduce the size of my collection, this item is for sale.
Game has been played a couple of times and the condition of all components including the box is very good.
The price seems a bit steep, but i do not sell only the base game here. If you buy the game you will get:
Mage Wars english 1st editon base game
Forcemaster vs. Warlord Expansion
Druid vs. Necromancer Expansion
6 extra spellbooks
All cards are somewhat shuffled together over the various spellbooks and you would need to separate them by yourself.
The package would be really heavy so please expect slightly higher shipping costs.
Non-smoking

All expansion cards are housed in card boxes -or- in their respective spell books
This full set also includes (i think around ) 8 bonus spell books, b/c I bought so many extra to make new decks with :)
You get all the instruction books, pieces, boards, but not all the boxes, sorry, I threw some boxes out.
Also little bonus many of the cards are covering in plastic sleeves.

Enjoy Mage Wars!
ps: I would expect shipping on this to be 20 euros or more, this is some heavy stuff!
pps: if you live in Amsterdam, you can pick it up from me in person, no shipping charge obviously.</notes>
