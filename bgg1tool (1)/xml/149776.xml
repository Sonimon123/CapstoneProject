   <description>In 1942, four soldiers vanished from the training program of the newly formed First Ranger Battalion, their names stricken from the roster. Chosen for their unique skills, they would fight in secret against terrifying supernatural enemies and overwhelming odds. This is their story._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fireteam Zero is a cooperative game for up to four players who must cut a path through an endless swarm of deadly monsters in order to discover and defeat the ultimate evil behind them. Each player possesses a set of brutal combat skills that are represented by a deck of cards unique to that character. Play cards to devastate the creatures in your way, help your teammates survive the onslaught, or even reshape the tactical landscape with the proper application of explosive ordinance. The battle is fought across three maps of increasing difficulty, each one bringing more and tougher enemies than the last. Players must search for and complete mission objectives in order to progress and bring them one step closer to the final showdown._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Aiding them are two NPC Specialists, one with an uncanny ability to sense the location and nature of the supernatural energy in the area and another with an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcane. Use the Specialists wisely or risk failure no matter how many monsters you defeat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Race against time as the creatures on the board become stronger and more cunning. The longer you take to complete your objectives, the more Monster Twist cards are revealed, each granting a new and terrible aspect to your enemy. In each set of missions you will face a different family of horrifying creatures, each with their own special abilities and twist cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players must not only fight for their lives, but at the same time they must make smart tactical choices with their teammates in order to make the best use of a limited resource, the cards in their hands. Each card not only represents an action that they can take, but also their health. Spending too many cards can leave you vulnerable, while spending too few can result in being overwhelmed. Clever players will rely on each other to succeed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fireteam Zero is a story-rich board game of squad tactics and horror. Each map can be played separately in about 45 minutes or together to complete an entire Operation in about three hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expansions:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1) The Africa Cycle:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Go head to head against the Thornspawn in this expansion!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;New Miniatures!

    <notes>I got the $145 Heavy Assault with all KS exclusives, plus all of the add-on monster models shown in the brown add-on sections, plus the team challenge pack and the mission generator pack.  Add that up and it comes to $255, my pledge.
Here is the link:

The base game has been lightly played; the rest is yet to be released but should be on its way this summmer, according to the last update.
The base game has been lightly played, but kept in a smoke-free home.  The expansions are yet to be released and will be shipped unopened.  The base game will be shipped immediately for FREE, and the expansions will be delivered directly to you when released, because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll change the shipping info on my Kickstarter pledge manager once payment is received, and you will be copied on the transaction.
Let me know if you have any other questions.</notes>

It was opened once to check to contents, otherwise it is as new.
Included are all miniatures of the kickstarter (183 minis in 55 sculpts). There is one more tray of monsters not shown in the pictures
Im shipping worldwide from Germany. Ask for prices
Please let me know what it is worth to you. There are not many of these on the market and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to make a fair deal considerably cheaper than whats on ebay.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for the first Kickstarter Rectruit+ pledge level. Used.
Includes the core game PLUS:
x4 Marrow Fetches
x4 Malignant Vermin
x4 Maggot Hounds
x2 Corrupted Soldiers
x2 Lungers
x1 Exhumed Fetch
x1 The Mangled
x1 Folklorist Minsk
x1 Herc
x4 Thorn Skulls
x1 Splinter Fiend
x1 Start Player Marker
x2 Escalation Packs (one opened and used, the other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards are still in wrapper)
BONUS: x1 Mission generator pack ($18 add-on in the KS)
Game components are in very good condition. Condition reduced due to some packaging materials: the box has a quarter sized hole in the back from a prior shipment, not noticeable from the interior due to the insert and game components are still protected. The mission generator pack deck box was packed tight with cards, and I tore the top of the deck box a small amount when I was trying to open it. The escalation pack cards are still in the plastic wrapping. I discarded the (ridiculously oversized) stretch goal box and some of the garbage plastic inserts which were taking up space. All items are packed in the core box.
Buyer pays $30 shipping or the actual cost, whichever is cheaper.</notes>

    <notes>This is for everything in the Heavy Assault pledge:
Core box (opened, played once)
Stretch goals box
The Africa Cycle NIS
The Europe Cycle NIS
The asking price is less than what I paid for the game!
This is a big and heavy box: 19 lbs, 14 oz. 17_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x17_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x21_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, shipping from zip 32934.
Yeah, shipping on this is going to be expensive, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll split it with the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>This is not for the actual game - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sorry if this is misleading but there is no category for my offer.
I have some additional Kickstarter bonus miniatures for this that are surplus to requirements. Rather than stuff them in the attic forever I wondered whether anyone could use them.
I have complete sets of the following monster families, still in their boxes and inlays:
Children of Typhon, Infected, Fetch and Spawn point set (all in one box)
Bloodless (one box)
Thornspawn (one box)
!! Please note that this offer is ONLY THE MINIATURES - the associated cards and rules are not included !!
I will part sell, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to calculate postage as we go. Payment is also negotiable for similar reasons.</notes>
