   <description>Have you ever had the desire to walk the streets of Victorian London with Sherlock Holmes in search of Professor Moriarty? To search the docks for the giant rat of Sumatra? To walk up Baker Street as the fog is rolling in and hear Holmes cry out, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Come, Watson, come! The game is afoot!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;? Now you can! You can enter the opium den beneath the Bar of Gold, but beware, that may be Colonel Sebastian Moran lurking around the corner. You can capture the mystery and excitement of Holmes' London in this challenging and informative game. You, the player, will match your deductive abilities against your opponents and the master sleuth himself, Sherlock Holmes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, you are presented with a mystery to solve, and it is then up to you to trace the threads of evidence through the byways and mansions of nineteenth century London. You will interview suspects, search the newspapers for clues, and put together the facts to reach a solution._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Why were two lions murdered in Hyde Park? Who is responsible for the missing paintings from the National Gallery? Who murdered Oswald Mason and why? These are just a few of the cases that will challenge your ingenuity and deductive abilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is not a board game: No dice, no luck, but a challenge to your mental ability. The game has been thoroughly researched for Holmesian and Victorian accuracy so as to capture a feeling of that bygone era._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The back of the box appears to have had something glued to it and then ripped off. </notes>

    <notes>Okay, condition on the box is good: minor damage at all four corners, upper left more so than the other three, three little magic marker marks about an inch long each, and a bit of tape on the back where someone had taped it closed without tearing the cover. The box contents are absolutely minty fresh. I must not have even pawed through the game. The registration card is still there and it looks like nothing is even out of packing order as it was originally placed into the box. Very very clean.</notes>

All of the content comes in a binder, which has some light shelf-wear and is in excellent+ condition!
The game is complete and all of the booklets are in new condition. The last 5 pages of the clue book are a little bent from the way they were sitting in the binder. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure with a little ironing they can be returned to their previous condition. As is, they are perfectly fine and usable. The rest of the pages are like new!
Shipping will be via USPS Priority Mail and based on a weight of 4 lbs. International buyers are very welcome!
I will gladly combine shipping if you purchase multiple items.</notes>

    <notes>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective (1982 light blue box edition) by Sleuth Publications
Box: Light shelfwear with several issues.  Box top has one split corner, a 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; split along the upper edge of the box front, a couple of small areas (1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or less) where the paper was pulled off during tape removal, two 1 x 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; areas of old masking tape residue, a couple of small edge dings, and a couple of corner creases from box stacking.  Box bottom has some writing and a 4 x 6 area where the paper was pulled off during tape removal.  Although all this makes the box sound like a complete disaster, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s actually in very good condition overall.
Components: Complete and in excellent or better condition!  Map has a couple of very small (2 mm) tears along one side, and the case book has a light thumb crease in the cover.  All other components are like new!

Box top is in good structural condition, but has some shelf wear around edges and moderate dishing of the box top.  Box cover also has two small scuffs, and there is a 3-4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; peice of packing tape on each box side (has not been removed to preserve box appearance).

    <notes>The box is in decent condition, with normal corner and edge wear, except that two corners are torn.  The contents are all present and in excellent condition.  My wife and I played the base game, but the gaming group I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m now with is not interested in this kind of game - and I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have enough room.
For shipping, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge the shipping cost plus $2 to ship to the continental U.S., and the shipping cost plus $4 elsewhere.
Also, I have quite a few games for sale, including two supplements (The Queens Park Affair and The Mansion Murders).  If you purchase more than one item, it will reduce the per game shipping cost.
I look forward to working with you.</notes>

Fairly certain this is complete, but if someone that is interested can point me to a component list - i will verify.

    <notes>This game is in good condition.  I picked it up at a thrift store so the box has some normal shelf wear.  The contents, however, are in excellent condition.  The game is complete in it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original 1981 production! :)  Unfortunately, the price of $2.99 was written on the outside of the box.  If you just interested in the game on the contents you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be disappointed.  If, however, the box concerns you, you may want to look elsewhere.

Box: F
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t actually have a box or a binder for this game. Instead, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been storing it in a [thing=1275][/thing] box (it fits along with the actual 221B game). Yes, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how I get my jollies. I can send it as-is, or I can pitch 221B and ship in a padded envelope instead.</notes>

Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective + Mansion Murders
Sleuth Publications binder edition (1982)
Components in decent condition for its age. Some marks on a few pages but doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t impede play in any way.  
It is the edition that comes in a large binder folder and it also contains the first expansion The Mansion Murders as volume II. 
The base game is complete but the Mansion Murders were lacking a couple of components (namely an updated directoty and the Question/Quizz sheet) which I have printed out and included. 
The two sets are obviously sold together but I listed them individually so please add each item to your order before finalizing...
Postage to UK: £5 (should be £5.60 with Royal Mail so might as well)

    <notes>I am having clear out of games that my wife isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keen on (my main game playing is with her).
All components are present and in the original game box. The edition is the Shamus Publications one from 1982 (It is the boxed, rather than the binder edition). 
There is hardly any wear, as we have only played a couple of times.  The map, rules, newspaper archive, case book, directory, case book and clue book are in excellent condition.  However, the box lid is indented in one corner and has a few minor marks on it.  
The price for second class postage in the UK is £5, if you buy any of my other items at the same time I will reduce the postage.
I do not want to post the game abroad and I only accept payment by Paypal.
Thanks

I printed out an added case from BGG, and printed out the amended case 3 text, all included in the game.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Buyer to pay shipping -
-EDIT-  Got the game out last night to take a look and noticed about a 1-inch ding on the box lid,   Price has been lowered to account for non-perfect box.</notes>

    <notes>Ystari Games edition. The game is complete with little signs of wear on the books. 
The first 5 newspapers had been misfolded out of the box and I refolded them myself so they have 2 creases, one at the half way point (where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s supposed to be) and one between a half and an inch off from center. I was able to straighten out the crease considerably on most so this appears noticeable on about two. Didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find these to have any impact on gameplay, but they are a slight blemish.
Also includes home printed version of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Mystery of the Hanging Man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (6-A), a free official case which was translated and uploaded to BGG. This is on regular printer paper for the newspaper and 110lb cardstock for the casebook. 
Ship from 85710 (Arizona). Estimated shipping: $10</notes>

    <notes>This is a truly fantastic game. I was gifted this copy from someone who did not realize I already had the game; hence selling it. It is one of my favorite games, full of devilish mysteries with a great narrative. An excellent game for couples or a small group of friends! 
This is the 2015 reprint; in English. 
The box says 1-8 players but I would say it is best for 2-5 or so people. 
N.b. the seal on this copy was removed when I was given it due to the box lid being damaged, but I have replaced the box so the copy you will received is undamaged and the contents have never ever been used.</notes>

    <notes>The game was carried around in a backpack a couple of times but, unfortunately, 
never actually played.
As a consequence, the box has some scuff marks (see photographs) but is other-
wise in prime condition; most of the game materials have never been touched. 
The game was stored in a non-smoking environment.
Shipping within German: 5,- €.
Shipping within the EU: 15,- €.
Payment via bank transfer only.

Das Spiel wurde einige Male per Rucksack transportiert ist aber leider nie auf den

Photos), der Rest des Spiels ist dafür aber in hervorragendem Zustand; die meisten
Spielmaterialien wurden nie angefasst. Das Spiel wurde in einem Nichtraucher-
haushalt aufbewahrt.
