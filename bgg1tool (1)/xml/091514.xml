   <description>Super Rhino! presents players with an incredibly heroic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and regrettably heavy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Similar to Turmbau zu Babel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>100% complete, and everything is in excellent condition, including the box.  Note that the box cover is in Italian, but the components are language-independent, and the rulebook is in 6 languages-- English, German, Italian, Spanish, and Dutch.
The wall cards fold up well to allow stacking.</notes>
