   <description>Normandy, June 6th, 1944 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; as you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies. You must do something!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed...or die trying._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. Although built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit. Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: This listing is for the commercial version of D-Day Dice.

    <notes>The Kickstarter reward was for the General level. That was almost the top level, so I got just about every extra they made. One copy I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m keeping, the other is yours for $120 plus shipping, or best offer. As it says below this reward level was worth $220 if you bought these things separate.
At this level you will receive TWO copies of D-Day Dice + TWO sets of D-Day Dice Pouches + TWO Distinguished Service Packs + TWO of each of the expansions Atlantikwall, Gott Mit Uns, Normandy and Operation Neptune (a 220$ value)! Your games will include an exclusive card SIGNED by the designer, and you will be listed in the rulebook as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;GENERAL_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; donator.</notes>

    <notes>This is for everything from Kickstarter at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;noncom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; level.  This includes:

I have graded this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; only because I opened the base game box.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still unpunched and the cards are still in shrink. Everything else is as it was sent to me.
Please contact me for shipping quote.  All of this stuff actually goes in a fairly large box, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship the most affordable way possible.</notes>

    <notes>This is for everything that came in the OFFICER edition Kickstarter package: the base game, the expansions, the Kickstarter-only expansions, the swag, everything. It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;signature card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because that didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come with the OFFICER level.
Everything has been opened (except for the bonus extra Kickstarter cards) and bagged, and much of it has been played a few times. Everything is still in excellent condition.
Buyer pays shipping costs. Note that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship worldwide, but this is an awful lot of stuff, and the overseas shipping costs may be exorbitant.

    <notes>This is a brand new, unopened DDay Dice set. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in the original shipping box and ready to be shipped on to someone who wants it. I kickstarted this very early on and it took long enough to get delivered that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have any interest in gaming for the most part. So, get a good deal on this one.
ONE copy of D-Day Dice + ONE set of D-Day Dice Pouches + ONE Distinguished Service Pack + ONE copy of the expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Atlantikwall_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (a 80$ value).
Price is firm at $50 and is a very good deal. Buyer will pay actual shipping costs. Send geekmail for a quote.</notes>

    <notes>Complete retail version, includes the BGG promotional Flare Pack.  Just played once.
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately.  
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost.  I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.
Thank you</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games, Inc. (VLY403)
Normandy, June 6th, 1944. As you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies... You must do something! In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed... or die trying. D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. </notes>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY403)
Normandy, June 6th, 1944. As you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies... You must do something! In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed... or die trying. D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. </notes>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY403)
Normandy, June 6th, 1944. As you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies... You must do something! In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed... or die trying. D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. It also includes solitaire optional rules. </notes>

I have too many solo games and my game shelf is bulging at the seams, so I am starting to sell-off a few games.
Will ship anywhere in Europe, and once I know where you live I will run across the street to the post office and tell you how much shipping charges will be.
Happy with paypal, bank transfer, or if you live in Berlin direct pick-up.</notes>

El envío se realizaría a través de Correos. Advierto que se trata de un paquete pesado. El envío por Kiala (kiala.es) es otra opción más económica y cómoda que dependerá del comprador, pero que recomiendo.</notes>

    <notes>Version - Retail sale version, not Kickstarter version. Includes Atlantikwall Expansion.
Condition - Both games new in shrink-wrap
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

All components are in the base game box.  The base game box is in very good condition but the box has some wear and has two slightly crunched corners but the box structure is still excellent.</notes>

    <notes>This is for everything that came with the kickstarter - all of the expansions and all of the extras.  I did not open anything or play the game.  I do not remember if the tin was shrinkwrapped - it is not now.  If I removed the shrinkwrap - it was to include all of the pouches, dice, extras and a checklist.  But the other 2 boxes that came with the kickstarter are still shrinkwrapped.  I put everything in the D-Day canvas tote that came with the kickstarter and then forgot about it.  My husband is not interested in the game, so I have finally realized that it will not be played.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>KS Backer Edition, Includes:
-Base Game box, with contents only played once and in excellent condition. Includes dice pouches from kickstarter rewards.
-Kickstarter promo items: Distinguisted service pack, badges mini expansion, and special RWB dice.
-Atlantikwall expansion, box opened but contents unused and still in original packaging.
-KS backer shoulder bag with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;D-Day Dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; printed on it. Large enough to hold the game and Atlantikwall expansion.
Played once. Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags. I will work with you to ship the most cost efficient way or however you prefer. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. If the item is a small card game the shipping will be USPS First Class and will be around $5 total with shipping materials. Local pickup with no shipping available if you live in the Seattle area.</notes>

    <notes>D-Day Dice Base Game + Atlantikwall (UP, NM).  Both in the base game box as received.
 
The usual administrivia: I’ll ship anywhere you’re willing to pay the freight to, in or out of the U.S. If shipped outside the U.S., I will not declare the purchase as a “gift”.  I will combine shipping on multiple items.  I almost always ship via USPS.  Insurance is highly recommended and at buyer expense.  I prefer PayPal, but can also handle money orders or checks (PayPal is better for international deals from my experience). Photos available on request.</notes>
