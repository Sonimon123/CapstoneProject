   <description>You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Repos Productions – 7 Wonders
Language: English, Spanish, Swedish _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Finnish
Players: 3 to 7
Age: 10+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 1.430 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: 7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player, as in Fairy Tale or a Magic: the Gathering booster draft. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided as in Bauza_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Ghost Stories.) Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.

    <notes>I purchased this game but never played at all since I can never find time to play.  Absolutely brand-new condition except no longer shrink-wrapped (one good thing I can say is that I now know that the cardboard insert is NOT damaged in any way).  Buy with confidence.

    <notes>Played 2X. English edition (Played with in sleeves.  Game doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come with the sleeves.  Please see below if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to purchase the sleeves and 8th Wonder from me as well.)
Game and box are in very good condition. Rules have been read through, but are in good condition.
The wonder boards don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t lie completely flat, but that seems to be a common issue with the game (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s really not that big of a deal)
I will ship to the US only by USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation ($11.65 - actual cost paid by you.)
If you buy this game from me, I will give you the option to buy the premium Mayday sleeves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the 8th Wonder promo from me as well for $10 more (that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s $5 less than they cost me).  This sale will go through the BGG Marketplace and won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add to the shipping cost of the game.

    <notes>Repos Productions - 7 Wonders
Language: English, Spanish, Swedish _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Finnish
Players: 3 to 7
Age: 10+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 1.430 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: 7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player, as in Fairy Tale or a Magic: the Gathering booster draft. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided as in Bauza_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Ghost Stories.) Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.

What kind of Leader are you? In 7 Wonders, players get hands of cards, pick those that will help them build their City and pass the rest to their neighbor. Their goal: build commercial ties, strengthen their military might and build their Wonders. Leaders introduces in the game notable personalities, who offer various advantages. At the beginning of the game, players create a Leader hand from which they will be able to play a leader at the beginning of every Age, or use him to get money or help build your Wonder. The recruited Leaders will allow you to build certain structures at a cheaper cost, even maybe for free, or will be worth victory points, or... Well, with Leaders, the Wonders never cease!</notes>

What kind of Leader are you? In 7 Wonders, players get hands of cards, pick those that will help them build their City and pass the rest to their neighbor. Their goal: build commercial ties, strengthen their military might and build their Wonders. Leaders introduces in the game notable personalities, who offer various advantages. At the beginning of the game, players create a Leader hand from which they will be able to play a leader at the beginning of every Age, or use him to get money or help build your Wonder. The recruited Leaders will allow you to build certain structures at a cheaper cost, even maybe for free, or will be worth victory points, or... Well, with Leaders, the Wonders never cease!</notes>

    <notes>Thanks for looking!  I have an opened-box copy, but cards are still in poly wrap (I never played it).  The corners of the box are protected as well by invisible packing tape.
BUT WAIT, THERE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s MORE!
Bundle discount available!  I also have the Leaders expansion in base game box (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve tossed the original) and like the base game, the cards are unopened.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling with this set an un-opened but box-less copy of Leaders to incorporate into the main box, for a total of only $35 plus shipping.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw in Mannekin Pis and the Catan promos for free!  Each of those are selling for at least $10 on BGG, so this is a fantastic deal.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d strongly prefer to sell the base game and expansion together, so I may not be able to sell the base game alone.  Let me know if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, I think the promos make it a pretty sweet deal.
Thanks!

Leaders and Cities boxes NOT included. Cards and tokens in the main box. Babel box is included and all its components are within it.
Base game cards have some very slight wear, and are of the edition where some age 3 cards have slightly mismatching colored backs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played like that without a problem, though, but the publisher will replace those cards if contacted.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - New in shrink-wrap.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

I ask that you Paypal me at candy@candio.com using friends and family so I do not have to pay fees. I pack well, and usually can ship w/in 24 hours of payment.

    <notes>Box is scuffed up.  Cards in great shape.  I got a second copy in a trade and I want to unload it for cheap.
After counting cards, game is missing one of the wonders cards.  Would affect if you want to deal all cards to blindly pick wonders, but I personally like dealing boards to people. Game already discounted to account for this.
Can also do local pickup in Los Angeles or Century City (california)</notes>

From a smoke-free home and treated carefully. The components are in great condition with two exceptions: (1) the wonder randomizer cards have some wear and tear and (2) the age cards have some warping, particularly age II; the cards head on look great (see photos).  Neither of these exceptions hinder gameplay.  Box has wear and tear and discoloration on the corners, edges, and inside the lid.
