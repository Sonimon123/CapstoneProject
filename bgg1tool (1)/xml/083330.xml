   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the roles of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG MAD01)
Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It’s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within.
Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.

It’s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within.
Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.

    <notes>As new - complete, punched but unplayed.
For an extra £5.00 (+ same shipping as below) I will include the Season of the Witch expansion).
Heavy so shipping is to UK only - weight in excess of 2Kg so price by standard parcels is £8.80, or £6.00 using _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;myHermes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, a private courier) If you work/live in the London area a handover/collection can probably be arranged to save the postage. I attend the Epsom games group.

    <notes>Brand New Shrink Wrapped copy of Mansions of Madness
Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £4.99 for this item.
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £3.49. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
There is the option of first class post and faster courier may be available if required.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.
Barry

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGMAD01)
Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within. Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact. Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness? </notes>

    <notes>Game is in like new condition and was only played twice. The game is complete and everything is mint. I will also throw in a *FREE* expansion, Mansions of Madness: Forbidden Alchemy. Unfortunately my friends couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really get into the role-playing aspect of the game which is why I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it and the expansion.
You will be charged a flat rate shipping cost of $18 to ship anywhere in the US or Canada. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m located in Ontario and only accept Paypal. I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship worldwide.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to selling on BoardGameGeek, and am looking to clear out some games my group doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play in order to buy other games. I can provide you with my ebay account feedback if you need references. 
Send me a message if you have any questions! Have a fun day!</notes>

    <notes>Second owner of the game, selling on as my group didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t take to it very well.
The previous owner had under-coated 4 of the cultists before I received it. The box has some shelf/postage wear that was there on arrival, since then I have sleeved all of the cards and looked after all the components.
This edition contains the errata cards.
This is a heavy game, as such will be sent by courier for £6 within the UK.</notes>

    <notes>This auction is for Mansions of Madness, lightly used.  
I am an avid board-gamer and my collection has grown too large to be contained in my closet; 
therefore, it is time to start making room for the next round of games.  
As a mature boardgame player, the games I am selling are very well taken care and are largely in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition.  
This game comes with everything from the original box, including rules, pieces and boards.  
The corner of the box does show some slight ware as shown in the pictures which is why I am selling it as Good instead of Very Good.</notes>

Got it in a trade and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see me using it so here is an attempt to get it at a great price.
I do combine shipping when possible.
Just FYI the game itself without packaging material is 5 pounds 15 ounces.  SO heavy game.  Since it is over 4 pounds it is not available for First Class International Mail service.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGMAD01)
Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within. Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact. Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness? </notes>

    <notes>Played twice. Everything is in good shape. I threw away the cardboard insert and created a nice foam-core one that holds everything much better. I can send a pic of the insert if you want. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not a super-great job or anything, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s functional and reasonably nice-looking and gets the job done much better than the useless cardboard insert the game came with.
The main rulebook does have a 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tear in the cover on the bottom.
Shipping will be a lot for this - it is quite heavy. Please contact me for a shipping quote. It won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in a flat-rate box so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be by weight/distance but figure at least $15. I will pack the miniatures very carefully to ensure they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t jostle during shipment.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGMAD01)
Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within. Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact. Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness? </notes>

    <notes>Hello
I am looking to sell a New in Shrink copy of Mansions of Madness.  I purchased a copy after playing the game at a friend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s house.  Subsequently he added a bunch of miniatures and expansions.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really see playing my copy as opposed to his so off it must go.
If you live in the Bay Area, you can save shipping and I can save PayPal fees if you want to pick it up.  I work in Palo Alto and go into SF with some regularity.
Cheers,
Greg</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Mansions of Madness has been played twice.  All miniatures, cards, tokens, dice, and game box are in factory condition.  This game has been properly stored in a child-free, pet-free and smoke-free home.  I no longer have the time to play unfortunately, so I decided to put the game up for sale.  All components are accounted for and all miniatures have been fully assembled with an attention to detail.
Due to the large number of figures and included components this is a relatively heavy shipment. Shipping and handling will cost $15.00 and will be shipped out the following business day after confirmation of payment.  Additionally, a tracking number will be provided once the package has been shipped.
If you have any additional questions feel free to send me a message via BGG. I also offer free pickup if buyer is located in Rochester, NY.</notes>

    <notes>Although shown as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; this item is as good as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Although the shrink has been removed from the outside, all the game parts inside are still in their shrink. Therefore, this represents excellent value indeed. Its a heavy box so no postage shown until an enquiry made and I can get an exact price from the PO. For payment, as well as Paypal, I also offer direct payments from bank accounts.</notes>

Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a very large size and very heavy game, and can only ship via FedEx.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) or long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

Mansions of Madness.
Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the roles of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.
Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness?
Mansions of Madness. Forbidden Alchemy
With four new investigators, two monster types, nearly 250 new cards, 40 tokens and markers, and six detailed map tiles, Forbidden Alchemy introduces a host of new enhancements to your Mansions of Madness experience.
Venture into the unknown with Mansions of Madness. Call of the Wild!
Five new scenarios and eleven double-sided board tiles plunge investigators into the mysterious backwoods, shaking the foundations of what players have come to expect.  A focus on outdoor maps encourages non-linear exploration, and new Allies assist in combat while driving the macabre narrative. Survive the wilderness in Call of the Wild!</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and has been played just a few times. Box does show moderate shelf wear, primarily along one side. There is also some moderate whitening and/or rounding on some corners, and a partial split running about 3 inches on a bottom edge. The components are generally very good. Most notably, a few of the chits show some slightly frayed edges. The cards were not sleeved for play, but were handled gently and show no more than minimal wear, if any at all.
Shipping cost will be my actual cost to ship from 95008. Local pickup in San Jose, CA, is available as well.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

NEW LOWER PRICE! WAS 100.00 USD, the price is lower than on ebay as of this month. 
This is brand new in the shrink.    FYI the game is new in the shrink. However the box is not in mint condition; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rate the box 9 out of 10 or Very Good to Near Mint. Three of the corners have rub wear, very small about 2 millimeters, The shrink is 95% intact no way to open the box but, some of the shrink is torn. This being said if your going to open the game all of this is not worth mentioning, due to how minor the issues are, if you want a mint collectors copy to keep and not open you shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t buy this copy.
Buyer to pay shipping of $18.75, this is the price for a large flat rate USPS box anywhere in the US. 
SHIPPING to CANADA is $60.00 USD this is the best price I could find
All emails will be responded to and all trades will be considered.</notes>

    <notes>This is between a Very Good and Good. The box has some corner damage and white edges but the components are all in very good to like new condition. Please see photos here: http://imgur.com/a/NtKvy so you can evaluate it yourself. All items are bagged and sorted.
Payment: Will also accept Venmo or Google Wallet. Paypal will be no fee if you send cash (from your Paypal balance or linked bank account). Otherwise 3%. 
Willing to accept offers as well.
Shipping: Buyer is responsible for shipping costs. The game itself weighs about 5 lbs, 7 oz and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s before packing material and the shipping box. I will try to ship flat rate if possible, otherwise ground will probably be your best bet.</notes>

    <notes>Box corners heavily scuffed and faded. Contents complete and undamaged. I bought this used but never played as the second edition came out shortly after. Mansions of Madness figures use a very soft plastic. Some figures may be bent after shipping. Dip these for 5 seconds in very hot water to straighten any bent areas, then dip for a few seconds in cold water to re-harden them.
I will pay for shipping to the USA via USPS.</notes>

Check my other listings and my ratings! 
I only accept PayPal (and only goods and services payments).  
Yes, I will do local pickup.  
Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  
Happy shopping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Happy Gaming!</notes>
