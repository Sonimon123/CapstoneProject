    <notes>Summary: Kickstarter Mythic Collection with stretch goals, exclusives, and Sundrop.  Core game and terrain are available *now* and stretch goals available when they ship.
I am selling an extra copy of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mythic Collection_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; bundle of Lords of Hellas. It is new and unopened, is the Kickstarter edition, and includes everything listed as part of the Mythic Collection on the Kickstarter page:
• Lords of Hellas Core Box 
• Lords of Hellas - all unlocked Stretch Goals 
• Art book 
• Terrain expansion 
• Sundrop pre-painted miniatures 
The stretch goals include the following Kickstarter Premium or Exclusive expansions:
• Hephaestus
• Kronos Rebellion
• Lord of the Underworld
• The Lost City (5th player expansion)
• Heroes and Monsters
• Pandora_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box
I have the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;first wave_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; items (which includes the Core Game, Terrain expansion, and a couple of extra bonuses) in hand now; all other items will arrive with the second wave which is currently estimated to occur late this year. (I offer no guarantees that the second wave will ship on time, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pass along any updates I receive regarding schedule).
I am willing to ship the first wave immediately and the second wave when it arrives, or hold the first wave and ship everything together -- your choice. In either case, you are responsible for actual shipping costs.  If you live close enough that you are willing to pick up your game (I live in Cerritos, California, and work near LAX), I am willing to work with you to arrange a pickup to save on shipping costs -- and again, we can work out two pickups so that you can get your core game right away, or a single pickup when the remainder arrives. (Cash would be acceptable for in-person pickups.)
I hope you enjoy your copy; I know I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been enjoying mine! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to make an offer.</notes>

    <notes>Absolute bargain!!
This is a sale for the base game AND the terrain expansion.
This retails for about £125
Please be aware that having played twice, and we are very careful, we have realised that there is a blue hoplite missing. This must have been missing when purchased. The buyer can obtain a replacement from the publisher and hence the low selling price.
Shipping in the UK plus insurance will be £7 or you could collect from Lichfield in Staffordshire for free.
Please note that due to the very heavy weight of this shipping overseas is likely to be very expensive indeed.</notes>
