If he wants to finally sink back and enjoy peaceful days in the sun, he must become the most cunning pirate!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Libertalia, you must thwart the plans of competitive pirates over the course of three rounds while using cards that show the same crew members as your piratical comrades-in-arms. Yes, not only do they attack the same ships, but they employ the same type of ravenous scum that you do! Can you take advantage of the powers of your characters at the right time? Will you be outdone by a pirate smarter than you? Jump into the water and prove your tactical skills!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Pirate ~ Loot and scheme! Outwit the plans of competing pirates over three campaigns while using the same crew cards as your comrades! Will you be able to make the most of the abilities of your characters at the right time, or will you have the loot snatched from under your foot by a wilier pirate than you? Dive in and prove your knack for tactics! The game takes place over three campaigns where players try to amass riches by looting ships. Looting is a dangerous activity, as players need to avoid collecting cursed relics. At the end of the game, the richest player is deemed the winner! </notes>

Pirate ~ Loot and scheme! Outwit the plans of competing pirates over three campaigns while using the same crew cards as your comrades! Will you be able to make the most of the abilities of your characters at the right time, or will you have the loot snatched from under your foot by a wilier pirate than you? Dive in and prove your knack for tactics! The game takes place over three campaigns where players try to amass riches by looting ships. Looting is a dangerous activity, as players need to avoid collecting cursed relics. At the end of the game, the richest player is deemed the winner! </notes>

Pirate ~ Loot and scheme! Outwit the plans of competing pirates over three campaigns while using the same crew cards as your comrades! Will you be able to make the most of the abilities of your characters at the right time, or will you have the loot snatched from under your foot by a wilier pirate than you? Dive in and prove your knack for tactics! The game takes place over three campaigns where players try to amass riches by looting ships. Looting is a dangerous activity, as players need to avoid collecting cursed relics. At the end of the game, the richest player is deemed the winner!</notes>

    <notes>Played a few times, very minimal component wear. Box has some fraying in the corners but no splits or dents. Shipping will be the USPS Medium Flat Rate ($13), if you live in CA, NV or AZ it might be $3-4 cheaper for standard Priority Mail and I always check before payment for cheapest price. I will ship with any of my other items to reduce shipping cost and/or can arrange for local pick up (Los Angeles, 91607).
Let me know if you have any questions.
Cheers!</notes>
