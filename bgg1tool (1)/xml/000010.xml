   <description>Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 139)
Type: Race 
Number of players: 2 - 6
Age of players: 10+
Length: 60 minutes
Game Description: In Elfenland, young elves have to pass a very special test before they are accepted as grown-ups. All elf girls and elf boys receive a map of Elfenland, and they have to visit as many famous towns in Elfenland as possible, using the common types of transp ortation: dragons, unicorns, giant pigs, elfcycles, troll wagons, magic clouds, ferries and rafts. These types of transportation, however, are available in limited numbers and can only be used in specific regions. Thus, an exciting race starts am ong the elves to find out who will make the best use of the available transportation. The one to visit the most towns will win the game.

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Rio Grande Games, 1998 - Elfenland - COMPLETE/UNPLAYED.  Outer Box is in very good condition with only very minimal shelfwear.  Interior contents are in unplayed/unpunched condition.  Everything still sealed and unpunched.  Board is very clean and solid.  NOTE: (1) of the wooden player pieces (red boot) is broken.  Bottom box has some slight shelfwear, a small tear with crease along bottom edge (about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length) and a small puncture (looks like a pencil sized hole, about .24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; dia.) with associated crease (about 3.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length) just to the left bottom of the image on the back.  See actual item photos below for further detail.  This game will weigh around 4.5 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping.  I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address.  Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above.   
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above.  Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway.  I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility.  All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be.  For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal.  I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation).  
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation).  Insurance is optional but recommended.  If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority).  I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay.  Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site.  You can look up my user id:  junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks.  I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG.  
Thanks,
Jon</notes>

I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion. While I take every measure to make sure the game is packed carefully and well, I cannot be responsible for damages caused during shipping. Insurance is available to the buyer at cost.
Shipping is $12.00

    <notes>Says 2000 on the box back. 2nd edition english maybe?
Box lid has two blown out corners. I could fix and reinforce those corners upon request for free. Interior is fine with all parts present and still sealed/unpunched.
Have King of the Elves copy with a missing part that would be easily replaced from tiles in Elfenland. Will shave off $5 if both bought together. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d also save on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition.  
Also includes Elfengold expansion (only sold in Germany)...with English rules for Elfengold. The Elfengold expansion dramatically changes the game.  This expansion turns the game into the original White Wind 1992 classic Elfenroads...but with a shorter playing time (the original Elfenroads was a little too long).
In my opinion, the artwork in this edition is much easier to use than the 2015 Elfenroads edition.</notes>

    <notes>A classic from Alan Moon in a new (2013), compact, multi-lingual edition from Amigo. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a race around the eponymous landscape using the kind of transport that Elves would use: dragons, troll-cycles, unicorns et al. The tricky part is matching your cards with the tiles available so that you win the race.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £15.00 (net of UK tax - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country).
I charge shipping at cost, as follows.
  UK addresses: £2.79 (myHermes, takes 2-3 working days, tracked) 
  Other EU countries: £13.32 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Europe outside the EU: £11.10 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)

    <notes>The corners of the Box have some wear and tear. The game material are in good condition.
I will ship from Germany and I am willing to ship anywhere.
Please ask me, for the shipping costs for your land.
I will charge shipping at cost. Everything will be well packed.
You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.
If you buy more games, then I make all in one package!
We have a large private collection of games. Due to space and time constraints we must rid ourselves of some of the games. Therefore, these are private sales.</notes>
