   <description>In ancient Greece _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; the cradle of European culture _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes compete for dominance of the Greek peninsula and influence over the shrines. Each player oversees the building of their own city-state. Temple, theater and oracle, a harbor with ships, vineyard with vintner, and many more must find space on the Greek peninsula._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Attika, players must move fast to get the best land for themselves while blocking their opponents from good building spots. As building is expensive, players seek to save money by using the natural resources of the peninsula. Players also seek to organize their building in an order that allows building for free. The game is won by the first player to connect two shrines or to construct all 30 of their buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The only reason i didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t give my copy a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rating is for some slight wear along one of the corners and on the back of the box.  Other than that, this game is in top notch shape--maybe only played 5-6 times. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a great light-medium game that can be played during a lunch hour with just enough city building and resource gathering to scratch that gaming itch.  Attika is also out of print, and of this writing, listed on ebay for $60. I just need to make some space on my game shelf and a little money in my pocket. I want to find it a good home! </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande English First Edition (2003). Components and instructions are in very good condition, game was played only a handful of times. Both the box-top and box-bottom show some rubbing (from moving) and some minor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wrinkling_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (from humidity), but all corners are intact.
Buyer pays actual shipping costs based on zip/postal code. Let me know your preferred shipping method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you  a quote.</notes>

General Information:
I sell this item as a private seller. I can not give any guarantees or refunds. Nevertheless as a board game collector I describe the item as accurate as possible. In case of missing tiles or damages I mention this in the item description.
Diesen Artikel verkaufe ich als Privatperson. Eine Garantie oder eine Ruecknahme biete ich nicht an. Als Sammler von Brettspielen achte ich jedoch sehr genau auf den Zustand und auf die Vollzaehligkeit. Die Spiele sind daher meistens tadellos erhalten. Sollten Maengel vorhanden sein, werden diese auch in der Beschreibung unter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Condition/Zustand_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; erwaehnt.

The actual game components and cards are like new, pristine and unplayed. The insert is also like new. 
The outer box shows a couple of nicks along edges and a very slightly sticky spot on one corner of the top where a label may have been, but otherwise looks new and shows almost no shelf wear.

Condition:
Everything in the box is actually _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or even _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Unfortunately, one corner of the box is damaged. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s why I selected _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Take a look at the images to see the damage to the box.

    <notes>Dent/crease in one corner of box lid, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not bad.  It isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t discolored and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect the lid_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s integrity or anything.  More like a wrinkle in the cover.
Contents are in great condition.  The cards have been shuffled several times, so they are not crisp, but none of them are bent or creased.
Cheapest copy in the BGG store!  (For USA, anyway).</notes>

    <notes>This has never been played and most pieces are still in the frames (the odd one has fallen out). Some very slight scuffing to the box has resulted in me listing it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; rather than _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Shipping, second class Royal mail, will be £3.50.
Happy for payment either by PayPal or bank transfer. A cheque is also ok.</notes>

    <notes>Description: Attika Used/Complete Rio Grande English Edition
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>
