   <description>In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the original Kosmos (German) edition, with wood pieces.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not from the first print run since it has the SdJ poppel on the cover, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s early (purchased in 1995).  It includes a bunch of Kosmos promotional material and also a Blatz catalog for some reason.
The box has a gash on one side which is ugly but doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really affect its structural integrity.  The contents are complete and in good condition - you can tell it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played because some resource cards have darker edges than others (viewed edge-on, they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t marked), but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about it for wear.</notes>

    <notes>This item is NEW and still in its original shrink wrap.
Buyer pays shipping costs (choice of USPS First Class or Priority Mail.) Insurance is optional but always recommended. I will contact you with the amount but it is based on what I pay to ship the item to you plus $1 handling (to cover boxes, tape, packing peanuts, and so on.) I do not believe in overcharging for shipping.
PA Residents will be charged 6% sales tax.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to order something I do not currently have listed as I can special order a variety of BGG favorites and provide them to you at a great discount.</notes>

    <notes>I bought this as my SECOND copy of CATAN simply because I was wandering through a Thrift Store and there it was! It is in fantastic shape - all pieces are there. In fact, the Map pieces aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even punched out yet! I always imagined I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d give it to a Geek Friend, but... they all own CATAN too!</notes>

    <notes>I bought The Settlers of Catan (4th edition) hoping I could use a two-player variant to make it fun.  Well, it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t work out for me.  :(
As a result, I only played this game once.  I will include the official turn summary page which I printed out.  All pieces are organized/separated and in mint condition except one of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ocean_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tiles used as the frame for the main playing tiles has light crease marks in its surface.  This tile_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s crease marks only affect the aesthetics of its surface - there is no actual crease that goes through the tile (like a paper folded in half) which would make the tile floppy at one end.  I have attached a zoomed in picture of the crease to show you what it looks like.
I will let this go for $20 plus $8 to ship in USA (shipping from southern California). I will accept payment by PayPal from a verified address/account. I would prefer a non-credit card payment so I can skip the PayPal fee.
Thanks!  :)</notes>

    <notes>This game is brand new and has never been played.
In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine the current production on the island. Players collect raw materials to build up their civilizations to gain enough victory points to win the game. This game is a Spiel des Jahres (German game of the year, 1995) winner, primarily because of its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike.
Will ship Priority Mail for $9.50 or UPS Ground for $8.50. Delivery confirmation, tracking number and combined shipping are all available. Please email thegamegeek@gmail.com with preference of shipping. If no reply, it will ship UPS Ground.
Credit card and money orders accepted. Please send paypal payments to thegamegeek@gmail.com.</notes>

    <notes>Second edition (same as third).  Components in good shape, all accounted for.  Box slightly bowed.  Small crayon mark on the cover. Someone played with dirty hands so the sides of a small portion of the cards are a little dirty on the sides--nothing major though.  
You could use this copy as a good club copy of the game, as your trial copy or use the parts for some DIY game or custom-map Small World.

    <notes>1995 Edition. Sell includes include:
Settlers of Catan (including 5-6 player expansion)
Seafarers of Catan (including mismatched German 5-6 player expansion)
Cities and Knights of Catan
I wisely marked the back of the tiles with a letter to know which set they came from. That is very helpful when you want to break down to only a particular set.
The game has been played maybe 10 times or so. Parts show some wear but I think you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy if you are not looking for a mint copy.
Buying this new (at retail) would run you $162.
My price includes FREE SHIPPING to the US.
International buyers pay actual shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Complete, and in good shape.  This is a well-loved game, and has been cared for and looked after.  I almost hate to part with it because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the game that led to my ... um addiction?  Let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s go with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hobby._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  This is the Mayfair 3rd edition, and I am its original owner.  I believe I bought it at retail in about 2001.
Will combine shipping, but will not markup.
Trackable/insured courier service preferred, but otherwise am flexible at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s discretion. Game ships from ZIP code 48377. Free local pickup available in metro Detroit area.
Also can accept all major credit cards through my business, though I prefer a check.</notes>

    <notes>This game is unopened and in the shrink-wrap! It is the “white-box” Third Edition and unopened and therefore collectable. This game will be a welcome addition to a “Settlers of Catan” collector (fanatic), one who wants to document and collect the game as it has evolved!
In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game. Multi-award-winning and one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike.
Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone at least 4 editions as Settlers of Catan. It has also been re-published in a travel edition by Kosmos and in yet another edition for Japan/Asia, Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.
Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series.

    <notes>This was an extra copy that was never played. The box has some very minor scuffing on the top and some shelfwear on the bottom. The contents, however, are in like new condition and have been lovingly bagged. 
The individual playing pieces have been separated and are kept in their own, individual tupperware containers that fit perfectly within the box. 
This is the edition pictured (my favorite), which includes the fold-out, full color standard setup diagram.
Excellent condition!

    <notes>This listing includes both 3rd edition base game, its 5-6 player expansion, and the Event Card Expansion.  It is 100% complete, but the box is a bit beat up.  Some dishing to the lid which caused some creasing.  A bit of tearing along the lid edges.  Personally, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it looks to bad.  I can provide pictures upon request.</notes>

Players are recent immigrants to the newly populated island of Catan. Expand your colony through the building of settlements, roads, and villages by harvesting commodities from the land around you. Trade sheep, lumber, bricks and grain for a settlement, bricks and wood for a road, or try to complete other combinations for more advanced buildings, services and specials. Trade with other players, or at local seaports to get resources you might lack. The first player to achieve 10 points from a combination of roads, settlements, and special cards wins. </notes>

    <notes>This is the 3rd edition of settlers of catan for sale. 
Basically i couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find a 3rd edition 5-6 player expansion so i ended up just buying a 4th edition copy.  
The game has been played a lot but everything still looks perfect all the pieces still look great nothing is damaged or faded.  The only reason i didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t put very good is because the box does show a decent amount of wear on it, not holes or rips just wear.  
Shipping is however much it will cost me to send it via whatever method you want me to send it.   
I will accept offers lower then the listed price.  </notes>

My late husband was a board game collector, his collection can be seen on BGG, user Kimbo. He passed away in 2012 and the time has come for me to start selling some of his games. He was an avid collector and kept all games in pristine condition.

    <notes>As with many of us, this was one of the games that really drew my into gaming.  I actually played almost exclusively on other peoples copies so this copy has had very little use.  I thought I just had to have my own but it rarely comes out so thought I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pass it on.
I also have Traders and Barbarians that would sell with this and make a deal for the set.  Geekmail me if interested in that.</notes>

    <notes>Settlers of Catan plus 5-6 player expansion, Cities _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Knights plus 5-6 player expansion, Seafarers of Catan plus 5-6 player expansion. Only played a few times, components in great condition, everything is stored in two boxes with some shelf wear.
Picture here: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2632761/kirkbauer
It looks like the Mayfair 3rd Edition, although it has the date 2003 in addition to 1997 on the back of the box, so perhaps it is newer.
I have this listed in three places as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure the best way to do it, but if you buy one you get all 6 items.
Domestic US shipping is $16.50 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).</notes>

    <notes>Not really sure how to rate condition on this one.  The contents are unpunched, box of cards is still wrapped.  However, the box has been wet, and has some rippling and water marks on the cardboard.  The contents are OK and stayed dry in original condition with no water damage or marks.
I also have the Base Game, Cities and Knights, and Seafarers, as well as the 5-6 Player expansions for all three for sale.  All from the same printing era.  I can make deals and combine shipping if you want more than just one.</notes>

I no longer have the boxes for the 5-6 player expansions for the original game or for cities and knights
If you wish for me to condense the contents and get rid of original boxes to allow for less shipping cost I can do so.
The original and cities and knights have been played multiple times, the cards are in acceptable condition. Traders and barbarians and Seafarers have been played about 5 times total combined and are still in good condition</notes>

    <notes>Having a clear-out. Feel free to check my other listings for combined shipping.
I bought this is 2010, so I believe it is the 2007 (english fourth) edition as noted above. It is *not* the current edition available in shops (I could be mistaken on the exact version, but can check exact version _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; provide pics if you want to confirm for yourself). It is the same edition as the 5-6 player expansion which is one of my other listings.
It is in pretty good condition, but do bear in mind that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 7 years old so isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t as shiny or good quality as a newer game (even if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just been sat on a shelf for the past 6).
Shipping £5 to UK. European shipping at cost, so please feel free to ask (although I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve looked into shipping to the mainland before and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s usually pretty uncompetitive - sorry!)</notes>

    <notes>Your adventurous settlers seek to tame the remote but rich isle of Catan. Start by revealing Catan’s many harbors and regions: pastures, fields, mountains, hills, forests, and desert. The random mix creates a different board virtually every game.
 
●     No two games are the same!
●     Embark on a quest to settle the isle of Catan!
 
Guide your settlers to victory by clever trading and cunning development. Use resource combinations— grain, wool, ore, brick, and lumber—to buy handy development cards and build roads, settlements, and cities. Acquire your resources through trades, cards, or lucky dice (even outside your turn).
But beware! Someone might cut off your road or buy a monopoly. And you never know when the wily robber might steal some of your precious gains!
 
Catan (aka The Settlers of Catan) has been awarded with “Game of the Year,” “Hall of Fame,” and even “Game of the Century” honors in Germany, the United States, and a host of other countries worldwide. An international favorite, it’s been called the “Perfect Social Game.”

    <notes>Bought new, box damaged in transit, cheated by retailer!!
German edition, plastic pieces.
This was sold to me as new. In fact, it was the 10th anniversary edition that had the Atlantis expansion attached. The retailer removed the expansion, left the tape on and sold me the game as new.
The contents are unpunched, entirely new. The box got damaged in transit with a large scrape on one edge, one corner scraped, another corner dented. If you can overlook the lid damage, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fine.</notes>

    <notes>Includes 5-6 Player Extension. 
Settlers of Catan is 4th Edition, has been played five times, and is in very good condition. 
The 5-6 Player Extension is 2nd Edition (which matches the 4th Edition base game) and has never been played (tiles unpunched, cards still in shrink). However, the extension box appears to have been dropped on one corner and has some damage there. Other than that minor box damage, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also in very good condition.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been played only a handful of times and is good condition. Box has a split on lid (which has been carefully reglued), along with some creasing, but otherwise shows no more than slight shelf wear. Components have been little used. Cards are clean. Tiles show small amount of white on some corners, and a few have have slight tearing on the back (from being punched out not quite carefully enough). 
Shipping cost will be my actual cost to ship from 95008. Feel free to geekmail for a quote. Local pickup in San Jose, CA, is available as well.
Thanks for looking!</notes>
