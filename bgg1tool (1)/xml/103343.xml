   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Dance with Dragons (2012)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Feast for Crows (2013)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – Mother of Dragons (2018)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A Game of Thrones (First Edition) (2003)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Based on the best-selling novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition lets 3-6 players take control of the great houses of Westeros in an epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne.
 
The updated second edition brings a host of enhancements to your A Game of Thrones experience. It incorporates elements from previous expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations. Convenient player screens will hide your underhanded dealings from prying eyes, while new Tides of Battle cards convey the uncertainty of war. This, along with updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, means the time has never been better to claim the Iron Throne.

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £4.99 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £4.99. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
There is the option of first class post and faster courier may be available if required.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>This is for a pre-order of a brand new copy of Game of Thrones (2nd edition), which is currently out of stock pretty much everywhere in the UK. The estimated due date is late-June.
UK shipping costs are £5.50 to your neearest collect+ convenience store (where you can then pick up the parcel whenever they are open) or £6.50 delivered to your door. Delivery normally takes 3-5 days. We only deliver to the mainland UK since shipping to Europe and further afield is ludicrously expensive.
If you are interested please respond to this marketplace listing and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll register your interest. Payment and fulfilment would then happen once we get a confirmed date from the supplier.
The price is dependent on getting at least 6 people interested in the pre-order, you can see more details on the related forum thread:

Based on the best-selling novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition lets 3-6 players take control of the great houses of Westeros in an epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne. The updated second edition brings a host of enhancements to your A Game of Thrones experience. It incorporates elements from previous expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations. Convenient player screens will hide your underhanded dealings from prying eyes, while new Tides of Battle cards convey the uncertainty of war. This, along with updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, means the time has never been better to claim the Iron Throne. </notes>

    <notes>This copy has NEVER been played.  It is perfectly like new, carefully punched for perfect edges, and has had a replacement board issued by FFG that folds down and up smoothly.  All the shrinked copies had defective boards so this will save you the trouble assuming they even have any more left at this point.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGVA65)
Based on the best-selling novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition lets 3-6 players take control of the great houses of Westeros in an epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne. The updated second edition brings a host of enhancements to your A Game of Thrones experience. It incorporates elements from previous expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations. Convenient player screens will hide your underhanded dealings from prying eyes, while new Tides of Battle cards convey the uncertainty of war. This, along with updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, means the time has never been better to claim the Iron Throne. </notes>

    <notes>Second Edition.
Game has been opened to learn.  We played through a short/demo game and realized it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t our _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cup of tea_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  The game is complete and in excellent condition.
Shipping will be my cost which is $11.35 (for priority).  Once USPS get parcel post back I can use that option - for now I believe it has been suspended.  I will gladly combine shipping and send you an invoice if you purchase multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>The cards have been taken out of their original shrink and bagged. The rest of the components are untouched, unpunched, and the game has never been used/played. The box top has a fair amount of shelf wear and a few dings.
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined). I only charge exact shipping costs and will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520. </notes>

    <notes>Game is unplayed - all pieces punched and bagged and like new except for map board - which is not laying completely flat on one edge. The backing on the map board has a small tear in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fabric_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; where it folds but this could be taped over with fabric tape and would not affect the game cosmetically.
I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to attach image files to this entry so go here to see shots of the board:

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGVA65)
Based on the best-selling novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition lets 3-6 players take control of the great houses of Westeros in an epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne. The updated second edition brings a host of enhancements to your A Game of Thrones experience. It incorporates elements from previous expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations. Convenient player screens will hide your underhanded dealings from prying eyes, while new Tides of Battle cards convey the uncertainty of war. This, along with updated graphics and a clarified rule set, means the time has never been better to claim the Iron Throne. </notes>

Based on the best-selling novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition lets 3-6 players take control of the great houses of Westeros in an epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne. The updated second edition brings a host of enhancements to your A Game of Thrones experience. It incorporates elements from previous expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations. Convenient player screens will hide your underhanded dealings from prying eyes, while new Tides of Battle cards convey the uncertainty of war. This, along with updated graphics and a clarified rule set, means the time has never been better to claim the Iron Throne. </notes>

 - Played fewer than 5 times, components are all like new
 - INCLUDES A Feast for Crows expansion
 - INCLUDES A Dance With Dragons expansion
 - All the large cards are SLEEVED! I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sleeve the small Tides of Battle cards
 - Comes with 6 nice little bins to hold each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s supply of power tokens</notes>

    <notes>Hello, For sale is my copy of the second edition of a Game of thrones The Board Game.
This includes the expansion pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;a feast for crows_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Also included are extra pieces for all factions except the Starks (these could be spray painted to add house rules for more factions, for example, purple for Targareyn!)
 + handmade pieces for a 7th faction, I used these to house rule the Eyrie/house Arryn into a 7-player game, handmade pieces include:
-some roughly made tokens for the 7th player - THESE ARE BY NO MEANS PERFECT!! - the circle tokens aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t perfectly circular, for example, and the print outs lack the resolution of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;real_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pieces!
-the right amount of horses, siege towers and footmen (regular game components, sprayed blue for house Arryn)
The handmade items are a bonus, and are more functional than a labour of art and love :) If you would like photos I can send some.
Lastly, the box has some wear, and it has a tear on the bottom on 2 of the edges, the box is in bad condition but the components are in great condition...  hence the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition and low price. All contents inside are present and have spent the majority of their time boxed in a smoke free home.
Shipping to UK is £5.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Selling a used game for the same price you can get it new on Amazon -- but wait.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how to create a bundled listing on BGG, but I am not only selling the base game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including the expansions:
A Dance With Dragons (2012)
A Feast for Crows (2013)
Each of these is a deck of cards, and are currently ridiculously expensive ($30 each I think).
The game has been played exactly twice, each time by me, solo (which I do NOT recommend -- it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t work, I was just learning the rules). I played with each expansion once. Enough to realize (once again) I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d bought a great game that I have absolutely no one to play it with.
Buyer pays shipping.</notes>

    <notes>One corner of the box is split along the seam. I can tape it for you or leave it for you to tape up, but it is a common board game issue and easy to fix. Everything else is in great condition. It was only played a handful of times at most.
Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from Chicago, IL, USA. Local pickup is available.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>
