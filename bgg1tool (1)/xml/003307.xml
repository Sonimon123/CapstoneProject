   <description>Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at L_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;tzen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur. The strongest power at the end wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Employs the cube tower included in the publisher's previous game, Im Zeichen des Kreuzes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Shogun_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Wallenstein (second edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Brand new, still in shrinkwrap.  Box has suffered some damage (casualty of shipping from Germany) as follows:
 - slight creasing on box bottom at the top
 - very minor wear on box lid_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bottom corners
 - very small (0.5 cm) tear in artwork on box bottom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s top left corner
 - creasing/denting on the bottom edge of the box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s right side (both on box top and box bottom), with some tearing (about 3 cm) in artwork and creasing in box bottom (see photos for example)
No damage at all to the box lid_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s top or left sides.
Note that the photos are actually of a different box with slightly worse damage than the one for sale.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new, still in shrinkwrap.  Box has suffered some damage (casualty of shipping from Germany) as follows:
- shallow 2-3 cm crease on left side at the top front corner 
- slight creases on front at top left, top right, and bottom left corners (very difficult to notice)
- creasing and very small (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt; 1 cm) tear in bottom right corner of lid top
- small creasing on bottom right corner of lid 
- damage to bottom left corner: creases and minor (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt; 0.5 cm) tearing to the lid, and a long crease and 2.5 cm tear in bottom (see photo)
On a bookshelf, this copy would not appear damaged -- you have to hold it in your hands to notice.
Marked as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because while the box exterior is damaged a little, it is otherwise brand new and the parts inside are untouched.

Shipping to 48 U.S. states via FedEx Ground should run $5-$8 depending on distance from NY.  Look at my other listings and buy two or more games to save on per game shipping costs.  Email me your address, city, and ZIP (use a business address for the lowest cost) and I will let you know exactly how much it will be.

    <notes>Game is still in the original shrinkwrap.
This game is quite heavy, so if you want to have it shipped as 2kg surface package there won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be any protection except packaging paper, so better combine it with other games for shipment.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.</notes>

    <notes>This is an out-of-print game.  Game has been played 5 times.  
Also included with all the standard components: home-made ENGLISH LANGUAGE laminated playing cards for the events and personalities.  Several copies of the BGG posted player-aids are also included (score sheets, small-sized copies of the map board (with production info) for planning.
This is a BIG box, so my guess at shipping costs (depending on how close to Maryland you live) will be in the $10-$15 range.  I will charge only actual shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Never played. I just can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t convince people to play it - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the original German, of course. That said, all the English translations on her on BGG and it is supposed to be easy to play and quite excellent... but you try telling my friends that!!
A bog box, pretty heavy hence it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably cost about 6 or 7 quid to post... but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get a definite cost if anyone is interested. I was going to sell this on ebay but decided to offer it here instead. If you want to look at my feedback my name on ebay.co.uk is sfessey
rrp is £34.99 but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll sell this one for £24. 
cheers,

The shipping costs, of course, may differ from country to country, probably €14 within the EU. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll go to the post office, ask and report back. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge only the actual shipping costs rounded up to the next full Euro.
The preferred method of payment is a simple bank transfer, at least within the EU (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you my IBAN codes). I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the best method transferring money across the pond, but I am open for suggestions.</notes>

    <notes>Game is still in shrinkwrap.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
!!! This game is quite heavy. If you want the game shipped as a 2kg unsinsured surface package I could only wrap it into paper, no addtitional box. So better combine it with other games or send it combined air/surface. !!!!
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>German edition (Queen Games). Played 3 or 4 times with only the box corner have a small ding (almost not noticable). All original components and a print out of the Enlish rules are in the box.
In excellent shape and the condition should really be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, however, wanted to be fair with the policies written by BGG since it has been played a few times.
Feel free to ask questions.</notes>

    <notes>Brand New In Shrink. 2010 Edition, this is a huge box filled to the brim with bits, and it comes with that fancy Dice Tower that everyone loves. I won it from a drawing at Origins and after reading some reviews; it is not really my cup of tea. Hop on this deal, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sleep on it. I have set a price well below MSRP.
I will ship USPS at cost. You can select the options you want (Priority, Insured, Trackable, etc etc) but they will all add to the shipping cost. International shipping will probably be ridiculou$, but I will be happy to ship it anywhere. I retain no responsibility for anything that happens to the game after it leaves my hands. Thanks for checking it out.</notes>

    <notes>German Queen Games edition (I doubt there is another one till now).
Game is still in shrink.
As the game is quite heavy shipping might be quite expensive depending on location.
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

Games come from a smoke free environment.
Paypal payment requested within 24 hours after the sale is confirmed.
First time buying from BoardGameGeek? If so, BGG arranges a private sale between a buyer (you) and a seller (me). Actual payment is handled independently of BGG. After the buyer completes the transaction on BGG, the seller confirms the purchase and sends payment instructions to the buyer.
If you are brand new to Boardgamegeek, i have a recommendation. Near the top of the home page you will find a heading labeled Bazaar,click and go to marketplace, there you will find information called (Read the Buyers guide).
If you have already done this, great.

    <notes>WALLENSTEIN: First Edition. Unplayed. No obvious marks or other visible damage. Includes English rules translation.
For sale by old school gamer selectively reducing his collection. All my games are stored in plastic bins in a climate controlled environment.
SHIPPING: When I ship I package thoroughly as if I were receiving the game myself. Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear first before I ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace.</notes>
