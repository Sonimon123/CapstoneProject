Shipping costs will be true, and based on your chosen options and speed. I ship via USPS. Your options are Parcel Post or Priority and any other extras you would like such as Insurance or Delivery Confirmation.
I pride myself on a fast turnaround time, and am almost always able to get orders out within 1 business day of receiving payment.</notes>

    <notes>This copy was opened and played once. As expected, all of the components are in very good shape as a result. The box is also good, but has one ding on a corner that happened in transit as well as a slight dent in one of the edges on the top. These are nothing major, but I list them here in the interest of full disclosure...
Shipping will be true cost, and will include your chosen extras (insurance, delivery confirmation). I generally ship games Priority mail because the difference in cost between that and Parcel post tends to be negligible, but it is up to you. I happily combine shipping if you order multiple games at once.
I accept Paypal, Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Checks, Money Orders, and Cash. I pride myself on a fast turnaround time, in all but the strangest of circumstances I will get your order shipped within 1 business day of receiving payment.</notes>

    <notes>Atlantic Star (2001) from Queen Games
Box: Light shelf-wear but some heavy damage to one corner. The corners of the top and bottom have been repaired with clear tape. Despite the damage, the box closes cleanly and does it job perfectly. Overall the box is in good+ condition.
Contents: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if there were other rule books in this version, but now there is just the English rules (and English player aids). There is a small pen amrk on the front of the rules, but except for this tiny thing, the rest of the components are in like new condition!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete copy of the German edition of Atlantic Star.  Even though it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the German edition, the tiles are in both German and English.  The rulebook is in German, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a translation (the same one you can print out from here on BoardGameGeek).  The text on the player cards is mostly unimportant, but you can print those out in English from a BoardGameGeek file, too.
The game has not been played, and is in excellent condition.  The box bottom shows light wear on its edges, and the box top shows very light use, as well.  The cards, boards, and tiles are all flawless, as is the crayon.  The rulebook is in very good condition, but is (as mentioned above) in German.
Shipping for this game is $10.20 within the US (for fixed rate priority mail). Note that I do reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount. (I charge an estimate of the actual shipping cost.)</notes>

    <notes>Atlantic Star by Queen
Box:  Light shelfwear with a no significant dings, dents, or creases.  Overall the box is in excellent condition!
Components:  All crucial components are complete and in like new condition!  The crayon is not included, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to provide another one (or -- better yet -- a write-on/wipe-off marker).  The pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

OOP. Box has some wear on the edges and there is three words written on the box _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;one ship short_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. However, all the cards are present and the cards are in great condition.
German Edition but there is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;no necessary in-game text_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
