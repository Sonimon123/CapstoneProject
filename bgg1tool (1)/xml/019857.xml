   <description>In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game has never been played and is in near-mint condition. Please note that my copy of the game included one extra copy of the Temple and Stairway card and is missing one copy of the Road card. Since there are extra cards included, it would be easy to paste up a new Road card if you sleeve your cards.  The chips are still sealed.</notes>

    <notes>This is the IV Edition. It is currently out of print. As far as I know, the publishers have no plans to reprint it. (Please let me know if I am wrong.)
I bought this copy of Glory to Rome in February 2009. I played it a couple of times, thought it was pretty good, then one of my gaming buddies fell in love with this game. He bought his own copy and he brings it to every session - so I have no need of my own copy. 
When I originally received the game it came in flimsy clear plastic packaging like the one seen here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/390194. 
This was not a practical storage solution - and an active danger to the game components. There was nothing to keep the packet from coming open whilst being transported, and I like to take care of my games. 
I have therefore repackaged the game in a proper cardboard box.</notes>

    <notes>BRAND NEW!
First edition, in hard clear plastic case, with large playing mats. 
 
SHIPPING:
   USA: $8 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.
Karl Hanf

Cambridge Games - Glory to Rome
Language: English 
Players: 2-5
Age: 12+
Duration: about 60 min
Weight: 0.500 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a patron, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents. Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.

In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.
Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.

In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population. Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome. </notes>

    <notes>This is for the Cambridge Games Factory 2010 edition. This was the last edition with the bright and colorful artwork.
Game has been played twice, but shows no signs of wear.
This game is usually around $20 on CSI or BnB, but is currently out of print.
Contact me with your zipcode to get an accurate shipping estimate. Unless you give a preference, I will ship whichever of USPS, UPS, or FedEx is cheapest with delivery confirmation. I will gladly combine shipping for multiple games.

    <notes>Cambridge Games Factory I.V (English) edition. Includes BGG promo cards and Republic Expansion.
All components are in great shape, and all cards have been sleeved since it was new. This copy has been played a dozen times on a clean table with clean hands. There is some bending around the edges of the plastic box/case where it has been rubber-banded shut with two rubber bands.
This item comes from a smoke-free, pet-free, adult-only home and has been meticulously cared for. I am liquidating my collection before going on a long journey.
I ship promptly and pack with loving care to ensure the game reaches you in the same condition it was when shipped. Shipping quote upon request. Combined shipping available, please browse my inventory! Local pickup available in Portland, Oregon.
Serious inquiries only, please.</notes>

Condition: Played a few times, complete, cards are immaculate, expansion cards are still in shrink, there is light wear and scuffing on the box, rules, and player mats.
Shipping: USPS Priority Mail, tracked and insured, probably a regional rate box A. For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $12 depending on how far you are from Indiana. Shipping to Canada is around $40. Shipping to Europe is $$$$$$$.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders. Bitcoin works too.</notes>

+ Glory to Rome: Republic Expansion (both I.V and Black Box versions)
+ Merchant Bonus Cards (both I.V and Black Box versions)
+ 5 Mini-Camps (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Travel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version of the player camps - 5 tile thickness 3.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 2.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; camps)

The box has the bubbling and dents that were endemic with this version, so it looks used, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s solid and none of the corners are torn. The contents were played with twice, so are in excellent condition (there is chipping on the Jacks - they came that way; again, a problem with the production of the Black Box Edition).</notes>

    <notes>Black box edition.
Has been played 5 times, so very light white marks can be seen around the edges of the jack cards. Since the cards are sheer black, they show wear quickly--- I doubt it would bother anyone but the pickiest collectors.

    <notes>Everything has only been played with sleeves and kept in identical condition to how it arrived new.  The box has a couple of tiny wrinkles on the wrapping, a tiny bit of ink smeared off the rules booklet onto the inside of the box lid, and some of the black Jack cards have very light and white chips.  ALL of these issues are seen in the entire black box print run and overall everything is great, as these are very miniscule issues that you may not even notice.
Shipping is $8 to CONUS.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but unplayed version of the Black Box Edition of Glory to Rome priced to sell very fast.  This does include the rare Kickstarter promo cards and the metal start player marker.  The box has some small nicks and small bubbling.  This is consistent with ALL printings of the black box edition.  Also, a couple of the Jacks have light edge whiting which is also consistent throughout the entire print run.  The whiting is very light and DOES NOT effect gameplay at all.  Everything is in excellent, unplayed condition.  
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t miss your chance to obtain this grail game.  Many people consider it to be the best multi-use, card-combo game ever made.  The artwork is absolutely stunning.
Shipping is $11 to the USA only which covers handling fees, bubble wrap protection, and tracking.  Enjoy the rare game.</notes>

    <notes>The game is in excellent, played-once condition. Unfortunately the player mats were marred by a previous owner who decided to cross out one of the actions with a pen. Those markings have been mostly erased and the action is clearly visible, but you can still see the faded pen marks. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s completely playable, just imperfect and the price has been lowered to reflect that.</notes>

    <notes>Note: This is new, never used.  It is the clam box version and was never sealed.  Three of the decks inside were sealed and one (the base cards, building sites) was not.  I believe this was how they packaged them because we ordered two at the time, and both arrived this way.   The clam box shows scratches like plastic containers do but is not damaged at all.
Will ship to continental US via USPS priority mail.</notes>

The black components (including the box) show some wear, which it typical for this printing. The inside of the box have some stains from the cards. Other than that, the components are in a very good condition. All cards except the expansion cards are sleevedץ

    <notes>This is the Cambridge games factory I.V. Edition.  Which is to say this is the version with the original _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;goofy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;-looking artwork and NOT the black box edition. This comes in the original (Somewhat cheap...) plastic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  Please check the board game geek page for Glory to Rome to see what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m talking about.
Everything here is in near perfect condition.  The only things not in perfect condition are the card boxes used to house the 144 playing card sized cards.  The boxes themselves don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t always want to stay together, seems like the glue they used isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t holding it together as well as it did when they produced the game.

    <notes>Glory to Rome Black Box edition. I purchased this used and I consider this in very good to excellent condition. The only noticeable wear occurs on the manual itself and there is slight discoloration on the inside of the top of the box. None of this will effect gameplay.
Cards and the rest are in excellent condition.
High Quality pictures are available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Cambridge Games IV edition which comes in the unusual yet highly appropriate clear plastic case. Love it!
All cards and components are present and in good condition. Photos can be provided to demonstrate this. 
I would say this is in very good/great condition but as we have played this it falls under the good category if we are being strict with BGG grading. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 
Happy shopping!
Ave Caesar!</notes>

    <notes>Description: Glory to Rome (IV Edition)
Shipping Weight:  2 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>This is a brand-new, unplayed copy of the Kickstarter Black Box Edition. Outer shrink is all that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been removed. Cards are all still in shrink. Components have been removed from the box only twice--once when I got it, and once just now to review the components.
Box includes the KS exclusive Promo Cards (36 total) and the KS exclusive Player Mat _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;risers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;--25 clear plastic feet (5 per Camp). The risers are still on the original sticker sheet.
The outer box shows almost zero wear. There are some small delam bubbles on the lid that were a known issue with all Black Box editions.
Actual shipping is paid by buyer. Local pick up in Salt Lake City can be arranged.</notes>

    <notes>Item for user charlievmorgan only.  Full condition as follows:
New in shrink (shrinkwrap has split slightly along a seam). Additionally, there are two strips of clear tape on the shrinkwrap; removing a third left a marginally sticky residue, so I left the remaining two strips as is. Lastly, the top edge of the lid [i]may[/i] have a ding; the shrinkwrap is of an inelastic kind that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hard to slide to see whether the box itself has the ding or if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just an imperfection in the shrinkwrap. Game originally acquired in this condition.
Item also includes Glory to Rome Promo Cards (Cambridge Games Factory New Art first edition) in shrink.</notes>

    <notes>GLORY TO ROME: Bought, never played. No marks or other visible damage. Note that this edition comes in a transparent plastic shell with the rulebook folded inside. 
For sale by old school gamer selectively reducing his collection. All my games are stored in plastic bins in a climate controlled environment.
SHIPPING: When I ship I package thoroughly as if I were receiving the game myself. Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear first before I ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace.</notes>

    <notes>Includes Promo Cards and Republic expansion!
Cards are sleeved and in excellent condition.
Includes both the cards and poker chips for building bonus tracking.
Because they are sleeved and include lots of extra cards, they no longer fit in the black clamshell they originally came in. Instead, they are kept in a Dominion: Cornucopia box, which holds the playermats and the instructions as well.
A previous owner chose to trim the playermats (see image), but all of the information is still present.
The rulebook had previously been folded , but it is complete and intact (see image).
Because of the trimmed mats and upgraded box, this item is sold at a discount to someone who has been searching to get their own copy of Glory to Rome.</notes>

    <notes>A very few cards exhibit the tiniest amount of whitening along part of one edge. The rulebook is used, exhibits wear, and has whitening. There is a tiny bit of whitening on one corner of the top portion of the box. The top portion of the box also exhibits a tiny amount of bubbling on top, which is a common production issue with this edition. I mention it here in the interest of full disclosure for an item of this value, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not very noticeable on this particular copy.</notes>

    <notes>Played once.  It has sat on the shelf for most of its life in my (non-smoking) house and has slight wear and tear, though the rulebook has been used a bit more than that.  Slight amount of bubbling on the box top, which I had never noticed until seeing a description of it from other sellers. 
Includes the following promotional items from the Kickstarter:
- limited edition badge (no pin)
- 36 promotional cards for Black Box edition
- 25 player mat risers
- 5 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;travel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version of the player camps

    <notes>This is for a black box version of Glory to Rome. The box is in pretty good condition, it does have bubbles as is common in this version of the game as well as some dishing on the lid. The insert is in pretty good condition has a slight rupture in one of the card bays that looks like it is a result of poor quality production, the insert is still completely functional. The cards and player boards are in very good condition, the Jacks have very little _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;chipping_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; also a known issue with this production. This comes with a Glory to Rome pin and the Republic Expansion but does not have the Promo Cards.

    <notes>Please read carefully. This is the French version. I have print outs for English translations I will include. It was shipped from France and they didn’t package it very well, so you will notice some dents in the box.  The cards themselves have no bends or dents, and are all very good condition.  If you can live with the above information this game is perfectly playable as an English only speaker in the U.S. see pictures for more details. If you’d like even more pictures please don’t hesitate to ask.</notes>

    <notes>This is indeed the Black Box edition. I bought it used. The insert was apparently discarded previously to fit the sleeved cards, as it was never sent to me. There are a couple of very minor dings and imperfections on the box (that texture shows everything!), including the common bubbling (fairly minor in this case, at least) that this edition is known for, but there is no significant damage. There is some whitening on the edges of one side of the Jack cards. The rest of the cards are in excellent shape, and all the cards are accounted for. If there ever was a small stand for the first player card, it was never sent to me. In fact, I have never even seen it in any unboxing video (does it even exist?). It is completely unnecessary anyway. 
All cards come sleeved with nearly $10 worth of Premium sleeves.  
Also included are:
* 36 Promo cards, (called the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Unofficial Geek Expansion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) 
* A fancy pin
* Small risers for the player boards (already attached, with a few extra ones)</notes>

Bundling games will lower the per unit ship cost. Ships via USPS priority or UPS ground for packages with dims over 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Will try and ship same day payment is received.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English. CGF.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

Everything is in great shape except the tuck boxes for the cards, which are starting to come unglued. For this reason I have purchased an aftermarket deck box (double size) to hold the cards. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include it at no additional cost, if you want it, but it will make shipping cost a little more.  Thanks for looking!  If you would like pics or any additional info, please feel free to send me a message.</notes>

This game has never been played. That being said there is some minor damage from shipping/manufacturing. The box has some bubbling. One of the merchant cards looks like it was cut with some perforating-blade. And the rule book has some damage to the front cover. Images provided below. 
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in great condition and only played a few times. This is the CGF I.V. edition in plastic clamshell. The tuck boxes are in good condition, but they were never the sturdiest things in the first place. I accept paypal and can ship out within two days of receiving payment. Buyer pays shipping to be determined by location. Due to the size of the game, shipping in the US should not be more than 5-8 bucks though.</notes>
