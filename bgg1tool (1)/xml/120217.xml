   <description>City of Horror is a backstabbing survival-horror game. As in classic zombie movies, a shambling horde is invading the city. The goal is to survive the assault. (Un)fortunately, surviving often means sacrificing some of your fellow players to the undead..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player controls several characters with different abilities; these characters can move to various limited-capacity locations, which they can then barricade and scavenge for items and weapons. Critical situations, such as zombies breaking in and eating a character, are resolved using a vote._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The basic game mechanisms are the same as in Mall of Horror (also designed by Nicolas Normandon), but City of Horror differs in both materials and game play in a number of ways: the city map changes each game, twenty characters are included, they can use antidotes (or die), action cards become scarce as the game goes on, you can gain points with stuff other than surviving characters..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

In City of Horror, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re playing a group of humans faced with a zombie invasion. The struggle against the dead is important, but your own survival is vital! To win, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to make alliances but also betray your companions. A game is played over 4 turns. Each turn represents one hour of time before reinforcements arrive. These turns are played out similarly: zombies arrive, players move one of their characters and then each location is resolved (power and attack). At the end of the 4 turns of play, the player with the most victory points (characters, food and antidote) wins the game. But be careful: to get into the helicopter, the players will have to make sure each of their living characters has been vaccinated. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMCOHMU01)
In City of Horror, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re playing a group of humans faced with a zombie invasion. The struggle against the dead is important, but your own survival is vital! To win, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to make alliances but also betray your companions. A game is played over 4 turns. Each turn represents one hour of time before reinforcements arrive. These turns are played out similarly: zombies arrive, players move one of their characters and then each location is resolved (power and attack). At the end of the 4 turns of play, the player with the most victory points (characters, food and antidote) wins the game. But be careful: to get into the helicopter, the players will have to make sure each of their living characters has been vaccinated.   </notes>

    <notes>[b]Shipping Options:[/b]
I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)
UPS Ground
FedEx Home 
FedEx Ground (commercial addresses only)</notes>
