   <description>In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight English Edition (FFGKN13)
Ingenious is the new abstract placement game from internationally-renowned game designer Reiner Knizia. Players place colored tiles on the hexagonal board, scoring points, blocking opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; tile placement, and trying to protect themselves from being blocked by their opponents.
Marvelously elegant, and compulsively replayable, Ingenious is an excellent introduction to German-style abstract board games. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ingeniously simple, and simply ingenious!
Ingenious is suitable for up to four players, as well as for solo play.</notes>

    <notes>FFG English edition.  Game is in great shape, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing the piece-stands and the pieces bag, although neither of those components are essential for play.  All other components are present.  Box has a minor dent on the bottom lid, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not very noticeable.  Box is otherwise in very nice shape.
Shipping will be $8.10 for Priority Mail.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGKN13)
Ingenious is the new abstract placement game from internationally-renowned game designer Reiner Knizia. Players place colored tiles on the hexagonal board, scoring points, blocking opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; tile placement, and trying to protect themselves from being blocked by their opponents.
Marvelously elegant, and compulsively replayable, Ingenious is an excellent introduction to German-style abstract board games. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ingeniously simple, and simply ingenious!
Ingenious is suitable for up to four players, as well as for solo play.</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Game of the Year Finalist
Spiel des Jahres
2004
Published in the UK as Mensa ® Connections

# FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES
# © 2004 Sophisticated Games Ltd.
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Easy to learn, quick to play, and absolutely beautiful to look at ...
Indeed in my view, this is Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most elegant game,
reflecting aesthetic simplicity and subtlety.
It is also, and most importantly, great fun to play ! _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
- The Games Journal
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; . ... One of the author_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and also this year_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best games. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;

You are when playing this extraordinary game.
Combining fun game-play, great components, and real strategy,
INGENIOUS will have you addicted.
Simple rules, quick playing time, and a clever system makes
INGENIOUS quite simply ....
Ingenious.
Created by acclaimed game designer, Reiner Knizia.
INGENIOUS is a treat for the whole family.
The game features balanced options for playing with 2, 3, or 4 players, or even solo play.
As the game takes only about 45 minutes, you will want to play many times in one evening. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
This game is complete including the instructions.
The contents are in excellent condition.
The box has only minor wear.
The price is: $ 15.00

    <notes>2004 Fantasy Flight Games 1st edition.  Game has only been played a few times and is complete and in perfect condition except a few scuffs on the box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request.

Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGKN21)
Designed by Reiner Knizia, Ingenious is the popular board game in which two to four players place colored tiles on a hexagonal board, scoring points, blocking opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; tile placement, and protecting themselves from being blocked. Its simple rules, quick playing time, and clever gameplay combine to form a subtly strategic and hopelessly addictive game. With punchboard tiles, stands that are built into the board, and other component changes, this mass market edition offers the Ingenious experience at a lower price point. </notes>

rules in english
In Ingenious, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each color group that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s score is equal to her worst-scoring color, not her best, so she needs to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGKN21)
Designed by Reiner Knizia, Ingenious is the popular board game in which two to four players place colored tiles on a hexagonal board, scoring points, blocking opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; tile placement, and protecting themselves from being blocked. Its simple rules, quick playing time, and clever gameplay combine to form a subtly strategic and hopelessly addictive game. With punchboard tiles, stands that are built into the board, and other component changes, this mass market edition offers the Ingenious experience at a lower price point. </notes>

    <notes>This game has been played six times. Its pieces are in like-new condition. The box has some shelf-wear from age.
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>
