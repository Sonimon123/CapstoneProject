   <description>In Troyes, recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France.

Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;anything for more fame!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Make your underlings:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     work on the cathedral_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     combat misfortune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     bustle about the city_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     and other such tasks that are below your family's stature_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Many editions of Troyes released in 2016 or later include bonus cards originally released on their own, so they have a separate listing in the BGG database._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7079)
In the year 1200, the foundation is laid for the cathedral of Troyes, but it will not be finished until 400 years later, after innumerable incidents. This game invites you to experience four centuries of history by participating in the development of one of the fi nest medieval cities ever to make its mark on Western culture. The society of that day was organized into three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobility constituted the military force devoted to justice and to protecting the lands. The clergy were the spiritual guides of the community, contributing to maintaining and developing knowledge and culture. The peasants and artisans, in turn, were given very little consideration, although their hard work was essential to the daily life of the entire populace.
Troyes is a strategy game in which you represent a rich family from the Champagne region of France, using your influence to recruit and supervise individuals from the three prominent domains: military (associated with the color red in every aspect of the game), religious (white), and civil (yellow). 
Each domain offers different benefi ts: The military permits you to fight with greater effi cacy against invasions. The clergy focuses on completion of the cathedral, and education of the peasants and the military. The peasants toil to fill your coffers. The citizens of the city provide a work force, represented by dice. You use the work force in different ways: to perform various activities supervised by your tradesmen, to build the cathedral, to
grapple with unfortunate events, or even to recruit new citizens. Each of these actions requires utilization of one group of 1 to 3 dice. In your actions, always regard the goals of the famous character that inspires your family. This individual is one of several very influential people whose principles have helped make the city what it is today! In fact, if you can figure out whose principles the other families follow, you can maximize your own fame, because each family will be scrutinized by all of these famous figures. The player who has garnered the most fame, in the form of victory points, will win the game! </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7079)
In the year 1200, the foundation is laid for the cathedral of Troyes, but it will not be finished until 400 years later, after innumerable incidents. This game invites you to experience four centuries of history by participating in the development of one of the fi nest medieval cities ever to make its mark on Western culture. The society of that day was organized into three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobility constituted the military force devoted to justice and to protecting the lands. The clergy were the spiritual guides of the community, contributing to maintaining and developing knowledge and culture. The peasants and artisans, in turn, were given very little consideration, although their hard work was essential to the daily life of the entire populace.
Troyes is a strategy game in which you represent a rich family from the Champagne region of France, using your influence to recruit and supervise individuals from the three prominent domains: military (associated with the color red in every aspect of the game), religious (white), and civil (yellow). 
Each domain offers different benefi ts: The military permits you to fight with greater effi cacy against invasions. The clergy focuses on completion of the cathedral, and education of the peasants and the military. The peasants toil to fill your coffers. The citizens of the city provide a work force, represented by dice. You use the work force in different ways: to perform various activities supervised by your tradesmen, to build the cathedral, to
grapple with unfortunate events, or even to recruit new citizens. Each of these actions requires utilization of one group of 1 to 3 dice.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7079)
In the year 1200, the foundation is laid for the cathedral of Troyes, but it will not be finished until 400 years later, after innumerable incidents. This game invites you to experience four centuries of history by participating in the development of one of the fi nest medieval cities ever to make its mark on Western culture. The society of that day was organized into three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobility constituted the military force devoted to justice and to protecting the lands. The clergy were the spiritual guides of the community, contributing to maintaining and developing knowledge and culture. The peasants and artisans, in turn, were given very little consideration, although their hard work was essential to the daily life of the entire populace.
Troyes is a strategy game in which you represent a rich family from the Champagne region of France, using your influence to recruit and supervise individuals from the three prominent domains: military (associated with the color red in every aspect of the game), religious (white), and civil (yellow). 
Each domain offers different benefi ts: The military permits you to fight with greater effi cacy against invasions. The clergy focuses on completion of the cathedral, and education of the peasants and the military. The peasants toil to fill your coffers. The citizens of the city provide a work force, represented by dice. You use the work force in different ways: to perform various activities supervised by your tradesmen, to build the cathedral, to
grapple with unfortunate events, or even to recruit new citizens. Each of these actions requires utilization of one group of 1 to 3 dice. In your actions, always regard the goals of the famous character that inspires your family. This individual is one of several very influential people whose principles have helped make the city what it is today! In fact, if you can figure out whose principles the other families follow, you can maximize your own fame, because each family will be scrutinized by all of these famous figures.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7079)
 In the year 1200, the foundation is laid for the cathedral of Troyes, but it will not be fi nished until 400 years later, after innumerable incidents. This game invites you to experience four centuries of history by participating in the development of one of the fi nest medieval cities ever to make its mark on Western culture. The society of that day was organized into three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobility constituted the military force devoted to justice and to protecting the lands. The clergy were the spiritual guides of the community, contributing to maintaining and developing knowledge and culture. The peasants and artisans, in turn, were given very little consideration, although their hard work was essential to the daily life of the entire populace.
 Troyes is a strategy game in which you represent a rich family from the Champagne region of France, using your influence to recruit and supervise individuals from the three prominent domains: military (associated with the color red in every aspect of the game), religious (white), and civil (yellow). 
Each domain offers different benefi ts: The military permits you to fight with greater effi cacy against invasions. The clergy focuses on completion of the cathedral, and education of the peasants and the military. The peasants toil to fill your coffers. The citizens of the city provide a work force, represented by dice. You use the work force in different ways: to perform various activities supervised by your tradesmen, to build the cathedral, to
 grapple with unfortunate events, or even to recruit new citizens. Each of these actions requires utilization of one group of 1 to 3 dice. In your actions, always regard the goals of the famous character that inspires your family. This individual is one of several very influential people whose principles have helped make the city what it is today! In fact, if you can figure out whose principles the other families follow, you can maximize your own fame, because each family will be scrutinized by all of these famous figures. The player who has garnered the most fame, in the form of victory points, will win the game! </notes>

    <notes>There is significant damage to the box, this was bought as a ding and dent copy.  However, the board, cards, and components are in excellent shape with virtually no damage.  If you can live with the box damage, this is your chance to get Troyes at a rock-bottom price.  Tried a couple of games and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not for me.
Will be happy to provide photos of the game upon request.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG7079)
In the year 1200, the foundation is laid for the cathedral of Troyes, but it will not be finished until 400 years later, after innumerable incidents. This game invites you to experience four centuries of history by participating in the development of one of the fi nest medieval cities ever to make its mark on Western culture. The society of that day was organized into three orders: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasants. The nobility constituted the military force devoted to justice and to protecting the lands. The clergy were the spiritual guides of the community, contributing to maintaining and developing knowledge and culture. The peasants and artisans, in turn, were given very little consideration, although their hard work was essential to the daily life of the entire populace. Troyes is a strategy game in which you represent a rich family from the Champagne region of France, using your influence to recruit and supervise individuals from the three prominent domains: military (associated with the color red in every aspect of the game), religious (white), and civil (yellow). Each domain offers different benefits: The military permits you to fight with greater efficacy against invasions. The clergy focuses on completion of the cathedral, and education of the peasants and the military. The peasants toil to fill your coffers. The citizens of the city provide a work force, represented by dice. You use the work force in different ways: to perform various activities supervised by your tradesmen, to build the cathedral, to grapple with unfortunate events, or even to recruit new citizens. Each of these actions requires utilization of one group of 1 to 3 dice. In your actions, always regard the goals of the famous character that inspires your family. This individual is one of several very influential people whose principles have helped make the city what it is today! In fact, if you can figure out whose principles the other families follow, you can maximize your own fame, because each family will be scrutinized by all of these famous figures.

    <notes>Contents: One copy Troyes, English edition, plus one copy of Ladies of Troyes, English edition also, in main base game box only.
Condition: Complete, played _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;5 times, in like new shape.  And as I said previously, it is all in the main game box only.  There isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t much space taken by the Ladies expansion so it all fit into the main game box easily.
Shipping: USPS, probably a regional rate B box, fully insured I figure about $13, depending on how far you are from Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders. Bitcoin works too.</notes>

    <notes>This game is new in shrink, however when it was shipped it got a small crease in one edge of the cover. I can provide pictures if you are interested in the extent, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pretty minor but knocks it from _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition.
If you are not in the united states and want me to ship to you, expect shipping to be pretty insane, like 50-70 dollar range. You can check beforehand by going to USPS.com and shipping 5 pounds from the U.S. to whatever country you live in.  Shipping in the U.S. will be 12.50 for flat rate shipping.</notes>

The box will fit only snugly in a USPS flat rate medium size box.  I will charge $15 for shipping.  If you opt for the cheaper size box you assume the risk of shipping.  If you want more room for packaging and to protect the game while in transit I will package it in a USPS large flat rate box. and charge an additional $5 for shipping ($20).  If you live in the Bellingham/Mount Vernon, WA area you may also arrange for local pickup.
I will only accept offers from buyers who are active BGG users with a trading history and are verified Paypal buyers.  I will only ship to the verified Paypal address with signature required.</notes>
