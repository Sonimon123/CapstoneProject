   <description>The undead hordes are back! But this time they're not miniatures shambling around a modular board - the zombies are coming straight for you!  As in most zombie games, you represent a unique character with your own character traits, except in Run, Fight, or Die! you will also have your own individual board with zombies you alone will encounter.  Zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. In either case,  every survivor provides you victory points.  The game ends either when one player finds five survivors and declares the last round, or when a player reaches the town line (and the total Followers in play meets a minimum), or if a player gets bitten and turns. Be careful, some followers may turn against you, while others can slow you down. When it comes right down to it, the choice is simple: Run, Fight, or Die!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scoring is based on the total points of survivors and remaining health of the players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; characters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Run, Fight, or Die! is a frantic first person experience for 1 to 4 players (will play up to 6 with the 5/6 player expansion).

Expedition: Famous Explorers is an updated version of two award-winning Wolfgang Kramer games: Wildlife Adventure and Expedition, with a new theme; discovery and exploration! Players lead three expeditions to various locations by placing arrows on a map. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches either a location card held by that player or a public location, that player scores that card by placing it in front of him.</notes>

The undead hordes are back! But this time they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not miniatures shambling around a modular board - the zombies are coming straight for you! As in most zombie games, you represent a unique character with your own character traits, except in Run, Fight, or Die! you will also have your own individual board with zombies you alone will encounter. Zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. In either case, every survivor provides you victory points. The game ends either when one player finds five survivors and declares the last round, or when a player reaches the town line (and the total Followers in play meets a minimum), or if a player gets bitten and turns. Be careful, some followers may turn against you, while others can slow you down. When it comes right down to it, the choice is simple: Run, Fight, or Die! Scoring is based on the total points of survivors and remaining health of the players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; characters. Run, Fight, or Die! is a frantic first person experience for 1 to 4 players.</notes>

    <notes>This auction is not for the game. This auction is for the RUN FIGHT OR DIE! Board Game Kickstarter Exclusive MUTANT ZOMBIE  BOSS FIGURE. This item was a 1 time offer and will not be made again. I have an extra that I am selling for a tiny bit more more than I purchased it for via the Kickstarter (to cover owed BGG selling fees). I am open for trades and a local pickup for cash come with a $5 discount. If you have any questions please feel free to geek mail me! Thanks!
PS. Will consider international shipping, but it will be expensive, so you would need to really really want it to complete your collection!</notes>

    <notes>Played 1 time only! I am looking to reduce my game collection and since this one didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see much play from my game group I am hoping that another family or group will be able to enjoy it. It is a really fun game just not what my game group wants to play since we only get together once a month or so. I take pride in caring for my games and this game is in excellent condition. This game comes with the following all fit into the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Big Box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;:
RUN FIGHT OR DIE BASE GAME w/ Extra dice set
THE BIG BOX
HORDE EXPANSION
5/6 PLAYER EXPANSION
CO-OP EXPANSION
RUNNING LATE BUT WE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;RE WORTH IT
Cat Sassy Secretary Character Card *Kickstarter Exclusive* 
Lenny The Butcher Character Card*Kickstarter Exclusive*
The Cat Burgler Follower *Kickstarter Exclusive*
Guy Gencon Promo Character *Kickstarter Exclusive*
Jasper City Follower Pack *Kickstarter Exclusive*
Jive Cat Boss Mutant Sculpt - Painted *Kickstarter Exclusive*
+Kickstarter exclusive loot cards (4), Fleeing cards (4), Event cards (5), additional reference board (1)
All together it comes with over 125+ mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s. The bases of my mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s have been colored to better help distinguish them apart. If you have questions or want additional pictures just ask!

Note 2: Unfortunately there is no extra discount for this item (see my standard terms below), as I have already discounted it.
