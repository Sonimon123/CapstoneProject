   <description>On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building in Saint Petersburg. Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Saint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Saint Petersburg: The Banquet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Saint Petersburg: New Society _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Rio Grande/Hans Im Gluck edition.
NOTE: I will be out of town until the 2nd of January.  At that time I will see if anyone wants any of my games for sale-- preference will be given to people that want more than one (and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good way for you to save on shipping).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship this any way you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.  You will need to pay the exact shipping charges.
Bruce :-)

Game Description: 
Baroque palaces, wide boulevards, and elegant bridges: St Petersburg. On May 16, 1703, Czar Peter the Great lays the foundation for the first building. Quickly impressive buildings are erected that are ever more grand and beautiful. Such buildings bring the aristocracy glory and the players victory points. But you need traders to bring the rubles necessary for all this magnificence, otherwise, the buildings are empty and bare. But the competition never sleeps and may grab needed cards right from under your nose. St Petersburg: the card game of beautiful living on the Neva.</notes>

Theme: Card game deals with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;gracious living along the river Neva_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;: the baroque palaces, wide boulevards and imposing bridges of St. Petersburg. On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building. Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (as well as victory-bringing Fame Points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants that can bankroll the necessary Rubles or the glory is over. The competition isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=quicksalelist_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=roamdog
Condition Notes: Smoke-free home.
Game has been played frequently. Board, cards, and bits are all in good shape, but the money clearly shows signs of being used in various games.
Box does show some wear but retains structural integrity - no cracks, breaks or tears.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery). 
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Please send a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer) to me.
Alternatively, 
Please send an online Amazon gift card to me (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Alternatively, 
You can send a Western Union transfer to me.
If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Please send an online Amazon gift card (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me) to me. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Alternatively, 
You can send a Western Union transfer to me.
Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that given the recent rate increase by the USPS, the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me unless you literally cannot find it anywhere else. I have no control over these shipping charges.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really accept Paypal payments any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.

    <notes>In like-new condition. Played once! All items are accounted for. Box is in excellent condition with minimal/no shelf wear. All rulebooks, money, tokens, cards are in there. No warping to board. Colors on cards looks GREAT! (Gold ink is awesome). I purchased this new. From my pet/smoke/kid-free home.
Buyer pays via Paypal. USPS 2-3 Day Priority Shipping is $10 anywhere in the US. Local p/u available in North Hollywood, CA.
This item was on eBay but I have since left the site due to their policies towards sellers. If you are Aimee from WA and purchased it from eBay as I was suspending my sales I will honor the $10 off I stated.</notes>

    <notes>THIS INCLUDES THE NEW SOCIETY AND BANQUET EXPANSION!  Both are out of print.  Condition is excellent.  Expansion box is not included, as all components easily fit into the base game box.  This is one of the great, classic board games with an equally good expansion.  Both games are hard to find, so please jump on this quick if you want it, as this will go quickly.  
$12.35 shipping.  PayPal to:  williamschris40@yahoo.com 
Happy gaming!

    <notes>Cards are sleeved and have little to no wear. Money is in good shape as is the board. The insert has a tear but you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice unless you pulled it out. See pic of insert in place.  Other than this the game is basically like new because it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played much and the cards were always sleeved. Upon request I will include the New Society Expansion for an extra $30 and combine shipping. I would consider the expansion in like new condition. </notes>

http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/29549/saint-petersburg-new-society-banquet-expansion
Game Condition: 
I ONLY have the cards and money (which in my version is not paper money, they are nice linen cards). The cards are mini size (same as in the game). 
The board is not really required, but I have a print out on thick paper.
It includes the New Society _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Banquet expansion, which replaces some cards so it must be played with the New Society expansion, the Banquet expansion can be taken out if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.
It includes an extra card for the 5th player, I use the cards as tokens and you just rotate the cards at the end of each round (see rules).
Excellent card quality, 310g linen finish (both cards and money).

    <notes>This is for the base game and the New Society and Banquet expansions.
All are complete and the base game is in very good condition.  Probably played 10 times.
The components for the expansions were only used once, so they are like new almost. But there is no additional box for the expansions. They fit nicely in the base game box.
***New Society and Banquet included in base game box.  The expansion box was tossed long ago.***
*I will not be selling these items separately*

    <notes>Please note that this is the 2004 out-of-print version of St. Petersburg.  The asking price *includes* the base game and the New Society and Banquet Expansion cards as well; I am selling the two items together as a set (it plays a lot better with the expansion IMHO).
I am the sole owner of the game; it comes from a smoke free home.  I have played it about 10 times and taken very good care of it.  All pieces, cards and instructions are present.
Buyer pays USPS Priority Mail shipping.</notes>

* money back guarantee - if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the game (for any reason), I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund your money (we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d split overall shipping costs 50/50 [within the US]);

    <notes>This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much. All of the game components (cards, counters, board, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. My wife and I played this a few times but always on a green baize cloth. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.
Please Note: I also have the New Society and Banquet Expansion for sale at £19. I will sell both together for £36 rather than £40 and there would only be one Packing and Delivery charge. Geekmail me if you want both.
Packing and Delivery:-
UK - £6.00
EU - GeekMail me with destination country and I will get a quote.
I would estimate between £15 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; £25</notes>

THE PAPER MONEY FOR THIS GAME IS MISSING. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not crucial as you can use money from any other game, or poker chips. All other components are intact and in great shape.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once.   Average condition.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Ich verkaufe ein Exemplar der Erstausgabe inklusive dem Bankett, es fehlt allerdings der Spielkarton (hatte ich mal so ertauscht und dann die Neuauflage erworben).
Die Materialien sind in gutem Zustand, alles in Zip-Tüten verpackt. Versand als Brief, innerhalb Deutschlands versende ich als günstigste Möglichkeit (unversichert) für zusammen 16 Euro. 
Auf Wunsch natürlich auch versichert.
First edition, German rules, all in good condition and incl _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Das Bankett_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (expansion cards).
Unfortunately the box is missing (got that in trade for some years and afterwards purchased the new edition).</notes>
