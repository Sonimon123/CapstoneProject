    <notes>Full Kickstarter Edition with RETAIL cover art (new and in shrink) including the following:
- Base Game
- All expansions (inside main box)
- Level V Promo disaster cards
- dual-sided cover art print
- Promo card holder
The box has the retail cover art. During Kickstarter backers could chose the KS art or the retail art.
The equivalent package can be purchased for 89.99 GBP from Modiphius:
https://www.modiphius.net/collections/thunderbirds/products/thunderbirds-board-game-all-three-expansions
Item can be shipped to Switzerland (from within Switzerland) or to any other European country. In the latter case I´d be able to ship the game from Germany, as this would save quite a lot on shipping costs and time (+ potentially on customs). Shipping weight incl. packaging is approx. 2.5kg.</notes>

    <notes>The theme needs no introduction – for anyone brought up in Britain, anyway. This is a co-operative game with the players taking the roles of the five Tracy brothers (and Lady Penelope) as International Rescue races to save lives and thwart the evil Hood. Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!
 
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). Or make me an offer. For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £16.67 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.
I charge shipping at cost, as follows.
  UK addresses: £3.09 (myHermes, takes 3 working days, tracked)
