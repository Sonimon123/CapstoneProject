   <description>The foray into space, sometime near the year 2700 A.D. Compete for the prestigious post of Ambassador to the Galactic Council. To attain this lofty position, players must leave Terra and the known planets to explore and colonize the galaxy, while working to establish trade with alien cultures, encounter aliens, and defeat pirates. Glory and victory go to the brave and astute explorer upon whom luck smiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The known worlds lie at one end of the game board, where each of the 3 or 4 players begins from known solar systems, each with 3 planets producing raw materials needed for the travels into deep space._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player begins with 2 Colonies and a Space Port (all components are made from plastic). The Space Port makes starships to transport your new colonies and trade posts to distant lands. Throughout the game, all the colonies and spaceports enable the production of resources when the dice match the numbers of adjacent planets. Resources are traded for colony ships, trade ships, and fleet upgrades of freight rings, booster rockets, and cannon. Beware as you explore_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;some planets are covered in ice, and some conceal dangerous pirates._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Belongs to the Catan Series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Very good condition; box and components complete. I bought this at the first BGG.com but never play it - it has been played, but all components are complete. Interestingly, none of the rockets have broken _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;rings_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I do have two replacement rings. Very nice - it will provide many happy gaming sessions. Shipping is $12 including tracking and I always pack very carefully. PayPal preferred.</notes>

    <notes>All components are punched and accounted for. Box has one broken corner. Some of the rockets have broken bits where the boosters go, but I got booster rings for all of them from Mayfair (and this is a known issue with the rockets). Otherwise the game is brand new.
Will ship after paid in full, checks and MOs accepted, but need to be cleared. PayPal fees resulting from paying with a Debit/Credit Card will be passed to the buyer.
Shipping and handling is covered by buyer, and should be around $15-20 (but will check to make sure).
I will send the buyer quotes for different options, and you can pick your preferred shipping option (from USPS). Insurance is $1.35 and optional, but recommended as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not responsible for mailing issues once the game is mailed.

    <notes>Complete and unplayed.  The cards are still in shrink, cardboard pieces still in their sheets (unpunched) and plastic bits (of which there are MANY) still in plastic bags.  The box has seen better days and has numerous dings - but is structurally sound (no split corners etc).  One panel of the board does not lie absolutely flat - but I suspect a small amount of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;back bending_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; will correct it.   Again the contents are in mint condition.  Includes the after-market booster rings to replace those that shipped on the rockets.</notes>

It comes with Encounter cards in English printed on decent paper stock, so that allows English speakers to play the game to play without massive translation sheets.  (please note there are no graphics on the Kinkos-printed Encounter cards, but are in a flowchart form like the cards that come with the game)

    <notes>*Includes both the base game and the 5-6 player expansion*
(Price is for the base game and expansion combined)
The box for the expansion is not included.  To keep the starships safe during travel (in the box, not through outer space), I cut the plastic insert in the games to make little spaceship protectors.
There is light wear on the edges of the box bottom, and one small (1 cm) spot on a corner of the box top.  The many plastic pieces (including the spaceships) are all in very good condition, as are the rulebooks, reference cards, dice, chips, and alien and resource cards.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

Everything is in excellent condition with one exception.  As you may know, the starships have been known to break when boosters are attached to them.  Most of my ships have this breakage.  Mayfair did acknowledge this problem and provided booster rings to correct the problem.  I have a full set of these booster rings, so everything works as it should.</notes>

    <notes>Box has some shelf and edgewear, with some scuffing/indentation in the lower left quadrant of the box.  Integrity is fine, but scuffing is apparent upon close examination.  Game is complete and in very nice condition except for the following problems:
The cap has broken off the red ship.  This problem can be played around and the original cap piece is present and could be fixed perhaps.
Three of the four rockets have booster rings broken off.  This is a very common problem.  Many boosters can still be affixed, and unfortunately I do not have the replacement rings from Mayfair that will prevent this problem from occurring again (which it likely will).
I am missing 5 (out of what should be 20) carbon resource cards.
Because of the way the game has been stored since we last played it (over 10 years), the event cards have a little warp to them that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t impact gameplay, but is noticable.
Shipping on this item will be $11 to Eastern and Central US and $13 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations, please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>A little use, mostly the manual. After inspection, the only problem I see is one of the ambassadors got damaged at its base (see pics). Teensiest bit of wear, but all of the plastics (where damage has occurred in other sets I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen) looks sharp and unplayed!
This includes the base game, the 5-6 player expansion and the five figure ambassadors, limited release!!! Both game boxes included.</notes>

    <notes>For auction winner Jeff Goldberg.
Game is mostly complete and in really good shape the following exceptions:
-- The tips on the Red and Blue ships are broken and long lost. You get the ships, just not the the long noses or red/blue colored disks on the ends. One of the ships has three broken teeth around the outside where you place cannons/boosters. You can still fit plenty of both on the ship.
-- The Yellow ship has three broken teeth around the edge. You can still fit cannons/boosters on the ship.
-- There is one missing Red spaceport ring.
Otherwise, the board, cards, attachments, green and yellow ships all here and in great shape. Even with the broken ships, game is still fully playable.

One of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ship-shakers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; has too many of one color plastic ball in it so I have a replacement from Mayfair.  3 of the original ships have 1 broken yellow thruster holder on each of them.  This is a common problem which has been fixed by asking Mayfair for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;o_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rings to hold the upgrades. All bits accounted for and neither box looks very worn at all. These are some big and awkward boxes so shipping for both will be $18.</notes>

    <notes>I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think the game has been played.  It is punched, but it might have come that way.  All pieces are complete and appear unused.  The ships do not have any broken clips -- my personal copy had a problem with these breaking until I added on adapter rings from the manufacturer.  I have not tried clipping anything on to these ships, but if you have a problem you may need adapter rings from the manufacturer (free as of about 1 year ago).
The box lid has a split in one corner and *every* deck of cards has some residue from rubber bands that broke down.  I have taken pictures of this damage with the worst card on top for each deck:

    <notes>Item Name: Starfarers of Catan
Description: Starfarers of Catan from Mayfair Games used/complete. Game components are in great shape. Box has shelf wear.
Shipping Weight: 6 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the sale of both Starfarers of Catans _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the 5-6 player expansion.  
There is slight damage to the booster part of the ships.  They do not hold the boosters properly.  It must have been a manufacturers defect.  This will not hinder the gameplay as you can just set the boosters in front of your ship.  
I live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  Prefer: Local Meet --_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Ship to Canada --_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Ship to US.</notes>

    <notes>This game is in great condition, no real damage noted to components or box except for 2 spaceships damaged in a way that was really common for the game.  1 ship has two chipped sockets for engine add on, and 1 ship has one chipped socket for engine add on. I did not see the parts that Mayfair was shipping to fix the brittle plastic ships in the box, maybe you can see if they are still offering those.
I will ship anywhere in the world, provided you will pay for the shipping. This is a heavy game and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess 7 pounds packed, please consult usps.com to see how much it will cost to ship to you if you would like an estimate. My zip code is 98052.</notes>

    <notes>Version: Die Sternenfahrer von Catan
Language: German.  The games includes full colour laser printouts of the English Rules including the Almanac.  The German components (Player boards, Alien cards and events Cards) have all been replaced with laminated English versions (homemade).  Unfortunately there is a spelling mistake on the homemade English boards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Attribuion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; rather than _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Attribution_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  Therefore the original German cards have never been used but are still in the box.
Condition: Box has signs of shelf wear.  The corners are worn and two have small splits. Nothing major.  
The Ships had the issue of the mounts breaking so I contacted Kosmos and I now have the rocket mounts to prevent this.
Postage is £5.40 via MyHermes (Tracked with compensation up to £50)

    <notes>Purchaser must either be local to the seller or willing to pay shipping from Vancouver, WA (98683)
This has been a part of my collection for several years; I acquired it as part of a trade and was able to piece together an entire copy.
I have a complete copy plus a damaged copy that contains spare parts.  In the spare box:  a complete set of cards, sealed; a complete set of the plastic pieces and bits, sealed; and 2 space ships.  Please note: this game is vintage...it is in great condition for its age, but it does show its age.  For example, the box shows some wear and the plastic space ships are brittle (when I received it, the little prongs that hold the rocket boosters were glued back on because they had snapped off over time).
My asking price includes both the complete game and the spare parts box.
See the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Info from Seller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; section below for more information.

    <notes>The game is complete, but has some issues. The bits on the rockets where the engines clip one are broken. Apparently this is a known issue and can be resolved by ordering replacement parts. 
Also, over the years the box cover has developed some _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bubbles_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. It must be the printed paper coming off the cardboard. I have no idea why this happens. Other than that, there is only the usual wear on box and game.
Has probably been played 7-8 times back in the days</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game AND the 5-6 expansion in two separate boxes. 
Good -Box has edge and corner wear. -Now the million dollar question... mothership condition. The color tops can be exchanged among motherships, but included colors for quick reference. Each mothership has 6 brackets for booster rockets. Blue- two broken brackets, Red- fully intact, Yellow- two broken brackets, Green- three broken brackets (Expansion- White- fully intact, Grey- 1 broken bracket) I have received and attached the grey rings from Mayfair to prevent further breakage of ship brackets and allow play without worrying about previously broken ones.</notes>
