   <description>A Keythedral is being built in the fields near Keytown, in the middle of the Keydom. The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Problems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers. However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

All components are complete and nicely bagged. Normally ship via Priority Mail, but UPS is possible -- although a lot costlier -- figure an extra $5-$10.</notes>

    <notes>PS Games -- Keythedral
Language: Dutch
2 to 5 players
8 year and older
Duration: 60 to 90 min
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,160 kg
Theme: A Keythedral is being built in the fields near Keytown, in the middle of the Keydom. The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields. The Keythedral will be built in five stages and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages simple materials will be needed, as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period the builders will require food and water and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine. Good luck in your endeavours to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time. Keythedral is Richard Breese_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fourth game in the key series.

    <notes>Pro Ludo version. Played a couple of times. No wear to the pieces, cards, board or box. Manual shows very light wear, but still looks great. Going by the condition guide, I would have no problem giving this as a gift, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather sell it to someone who might show it some more love!
I prefer paypal, but will accept money order or check. Buyer pays shipping (I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for the box or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;handling_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s known). US buyers only please.

    <notes>BRANDNEW: I´m offering the OOP ProLudo edition in mint condition (still shrinkwrapped!). 
This is the German edition, but the law cards are self-explanatory (illustrated and numbered), so there is no language dependency. 
All games come from a private collection (non-smoking environment)!
Please contact me if you´re looking for more interesting German games as I can offer a lot more.
Buyer pays postage, so ask before buying to determine the weight of your desired games! 
The following payments are welcome: 
(1) Cash in a registered letter (only Euro accepted) or
(2) Chargefree EU Bank-Transfer (using IBAN and SWIFT) or 
(3) Moneybookers.com (it´s as fast and safe as PayPal but much cheaper: maximum fee is 0.50 EUR) or
(4) PayPal (for PayPal payment please add +5 % of the total sum).
Have fun playing, Flix!

    <notes>Minor dings on box corners, otherwise perfect condition.  Box insert has been removed but you can keep the great Plano case I found for $4 extra.
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the storage container included and add the additional cost to the total.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

It has been played once.  All pieces are in beautiful condition.  The box is pristine, but for a minuscule crumple on one corner.  The player screens have been folded gently.
This game is BEAUTIFUL.  Every terrain hex and player screen is a unique piece of artwork!

R _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; D Games First Edition. I played this game one time back in 2009 and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t touched it since. If I recall, I liked it. 
The box is made of flimsy cardboard, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s held up pretty well. There is minor dishing and a couple diagonal creases on the box top, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not too noticeable. The bits are bagged and the cards are in good shape. Two player boards have a slight bend to them but can be easily bent back since the cardboard is not as thick as it should be. Overall, a game in very good condition.
Also in this listing is a copy of The Speicherstadt, new in shrink, if he wants it.

    <notes>This game has never been played.  It is not shrinkwrapped, but I am not sure it came with shrinkwrap.  The cards are not factory sealed, but that is because they came with bands on them.  I immediately put them in plastic bags because I am not a fan of putting bands on cards.  The components are loose, but I cannot remember if they came this way or if I punched the components.  It is the first edition - this box is not the heavy, sturdy boxes that you see when the game is in a bigger print run.  The box is in great shape, but there is an extremely minor crease in one corner and an extremely minor crimp in the opposite corner.  It was shipped to me this way - I have seen this type of minor imperfections in first edition, smaller print runs but I wanted to mention them in case somebody is more interested in collecting this game as opposed to playing the game.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D (first) edition. It was played maybe once or twice, so all the components are in excellent condition. The (flimsy) box has a few minor scratches and scuffs.
This includes a sheet I made up that explains the minor differences between the first and second editions; it is simple to play this copy with second edition rules.</notes>

    <notes>This item is Brand New in shrink, but the shrink wrap is torn all down one side. Additionally the item was stored in a window and has some sun fading on the front and sides. Since the cover is pastel to begin with, it is not super noticeable. I tried to capture the full condition in pictures, but if you would like any additional pictures, please just let me know. 2004 Pro Ludo English edition (though the back is written in multiple languages.)
Buyer to pay actual shipping cost from Zip Code 61455. Can also arrange local pickup. I am willing to combine shipping if you are interested in more than one item.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rate this _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, I only played it once when I first opened it, though now that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting it up for sale I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m looking real close and see a very narrow width depression in the box top... like at some point someone had a piece of paper on it and drew a line on the paper and the pen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ball point depressed the paper and a little into the box top.... I tried to take a picture (see attached) but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t show in the pic (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s slightly above the outermost border where the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s title is).</notes>

Hi,
I’ll be in Essen from Wednesday to Sunday. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be working at Feuerland Booth (4-C116) this year. 
For handover I can offer to meet you
- during setup on Wednesday   OR 
- at the general Math Trade Meeting on Friday at 12.00. However, I’ll be at the MT meeting place already at 11.30 to avoid some of the crowd and to get a good setup location. You’re welcome to meet me early…  :-)
I hope you will be able to make it to the meeting on Friday. If you can’t please contact me and we can work out a handover at the Feuerland Booth.
For contacting me at the fair, my mobile is +49 176 56806418. I’d appreciate if you could leave me your mobile no as well.
I’m looking forward to meeting you.
Cheers,
Carsten
