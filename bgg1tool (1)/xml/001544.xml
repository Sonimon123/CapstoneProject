   <description>Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.  Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.  Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Law_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Date_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).  Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates.  Balderdash with a single category (word definitions) has not existed since at least 2003._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Kokkelimonke Jubileum_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Balderdash_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Very slight edgewear on box, contents otherwise in beautiful shape. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look like any of the sheets have been used from the definition pad.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also include a stack of photocopied definition pad sheets as a bonus!
I welcome international buyers!</notes>

This is the prefered edition over Balderdash.
Contents are in good shape; clean, undamaged, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; complete.  Copies of the scoresheets are included and a master for more copies.  The box has no split corners, but has shelf wear and is dinged. (see picture).</notes>

    <notes>English edition of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Absolute Balderdash_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Law_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; category rather than _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Dates_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; category).
Complete _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; very good clean condition.  Box has one split corner and very minor shelfwear on the edges with a small name written in pen on box lid.
Reasonable offers will be considered.  I can combine multiple purchases to reduce shipping costs.

    <notes>Canadian edition with English rulebook.  This version is called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Absolute Balderdash_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and has a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Date_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; category rather than the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Law_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; category that the UK version has.
Complete contents in very good clean condition.  Box has a split corner with only very minor shelfwear on the edges.
Reasonable offers will be considered.  I can combine multiple purchases to reduce shipping costs.
Shipping Costs: UK £5, Europe £12, USA £15</notes>
