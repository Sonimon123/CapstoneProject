   <description>In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one god, but must pay homage to each of five gods in turn.  Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the gods, as only one player can have the favor of each god per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single god per turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Matagot - Cyclades
Language: Dutch, English, French, German
Players: 2-5
Age: 13+
Duration: 60 to 90 min
Weight: 1.900 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the Gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades. Victory requires respect for all the Gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one God, but must pay homage to each of five Gods in turn. Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the Gods, as only one player can have the favor of each God per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single God per turn.

    <notes>Matagot - Cyclades
Language: Dutch, English, French, German
Players: 2-5
Age: 13+
Duration: 60 to 90 min
Weight: 1.900 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the Gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades. Victory requires respect for all the Gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one God, but must pay homage to each of five Gods in turn. Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the Gods, as only one player can have the favor of each God per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single God per turn.

    <notes>Game is unpunched, HOWEVER, there was corner crushing on the box when I received it, so I removed the shrink to make sure the contents were okay - they were. Some of the pieces have self-punched themselves as nicely die-cut Euro games have a tendency to do.

    <notes>Opened, mostly punched, played once.
Box doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even show wear.
;)  Better than if you buy it in shrink: was missing parts, but they have been obtained from the publisher.
Can do face-to-face handoff in the Washington DC area.
Discounts for multiple games in a purchase: $2 off all but most expensive game, will combine shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m flexible with shipping. USPS seems cheapest. Use http://postcalc.usps.gov/ to estimate a price, shipping from 20171, weight of 4 lbs 8 ounce, I can use the pay online feature.
Still have the sprues, can include them or not.

The rise of nations in a land of myth and legend. Beseech the gods of Olympus and release the most powerful mythical creatures of ancient Greece as you claw your way to the top. Build armies and cities, hire scholars and priests, and be the first to build your metropolis. Only by creating the most magnificent cities of all time will you claim your place as the rightful ruler of the Cyclades! Each player in Cyclades will lead his people in their conquest of ancient Greece. Each turn, you must beseech the gods for the right to build ships, train soldiers, or hire priests. Recruit the gorgon or the kraken, the minotaur or the harpy, and use their power to bolster your defenses or destroy your foes. Build mighty fortresses and legendary libraries in your quest to create the most impressive metropolis the world has ever seen. Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, the acclaimed designers behind Mr. Jack and Dice Town, present Cyclades, a game of conquest and development in a time of legend. Featuring lush and beautiful art, intricately sculpted plastic figures, and a modular board that scales up to accommodate any number of players, Cyclades will excite and entertain the most demanding fans of strategic and tactical games. </notes>

    <notes>Description: 
With the blessing of the gods of Olympus and the support of mythological creatures, you will recruit troops, build ships, create fortresses, and construct metropolises. The creators of Cyclades reinvent the development and conquest game. In a 90-minute session, live through incredible adventure in which soldiers, philosophers, mythological creatures, and gods are common! In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades. Victory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one, but must pay homage to each of the five gods in turn.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMCYC01)
The rise of nations in a land of myth and legend. Beseech the gods of Olympus and release the most powerful mythical creatures of ancient Greece as you claw your way to the top. Build armies and cities, hire scholars and priests, and be the first to build your metropolis. Only by creating the most magnificent cities of all time will you claim your place as the rightful ruler of the Cyclades! Each player in Cyclades will lead his people in their conquest of ancient Greece. Each turn, you must beseech the gods for the right to build ships, train soldiers, or hire priests. Recruit the gorgon or the kraken, the minotaur or the harpy, and use their power to bolster your defenses or destroy your foes. Build mighty fortresses and legendary libraries in your quest to create the most impressive metropolis the world has ever seen. Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, the acclaimed designers behind Mr. Jack and Dice Town, present Cyclades, a game of conquest and development in a time of legend. Featuring lush and beautiful art, intricately sculpted plastic figures, and a modular board that scales up to accommodate any number of players, Cyclades will excite and entertain the most demanding fans of strategic and tactical games. </notes>

    <notes>Played the game once.  Bought the game new, have been the only owner of it, kept in a smoke free environment.  No ding or dent.  I have several play aids I printed from the internet, some laminated to help with game play.  Not enough space in my library to keep this one and have other games to play with this many players.  Hoping it will find more play time with someone else.  I also have the Hades Expansion for sale on BGG as well, if interested in a bundle.  The Expansion is still sealed, new in the box. Actual shipping charges to be determine at point of sale.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, played a few times, in great condition. The box bottom is starting to show some corner splits on two corners.  But check this out: It includes the 5 monster figurines painted!  And the paint job is pretty good - check out the pics.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a Plano plastic case that holds them.  It also includes the Manitcore promo card.  And all cards are sleeved.  This is a great set.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $8.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and in great condition overall.  Two of the black ships had sails that were broken when purchased and so I glued them back on.  This does not affect game play in anyway.  The box has a slight dent in one corner.  Shipping will be based on purchaser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s location or pick up at Gen Con 2015 is available.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMCYC01)
The rise of nations in a land of myth and legend. Beseech the gods of Olympus and release the most powerful mythical creatures of ancient Greece as you claw your way to the top. Build armies and cities, hire scholars and priests, and be the first to build your metropolis. Only by creating the most magnificent cities of all time will you claim your place as the rightful ruler of the Cyclades! Each player in Cyclades will lead his people in their conquest of ancient Greece. Each turn, you must beseech the gods for the right to build ships, train soldiers, or hire priests. Recruit the gorgon or the kraken, the minotaur or the harpy, and use their power to bolster your defenses or destroy your foes. Build mighty fortresses and legendary libraries in your quest to create the most impressive metropolis the world has ever seen. Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, the acclaimed designers behind Mr. Jack and Dice Town, present Cyclades, a game of conquest and development in a time of legend. Featuring lush and beautiful art, intricately sculpted plastic figures, and a modular board that scales up to accommodate any number of players, Cyclades will excite and entertain the most demanding fans of strategic and tactical games.</notes>

    <notes>EXCELLENT DEAL PRICED TO SELL FAST!  
Includes the Hades Expansion held in the base game box.  The cheap cardboard inserts to cyclades and the expansion were thrown away.  The Ares tile from the base game has a light crease along the back side of it (came to me like that..game was never played).  All other components are like new, but the box does have shelf wear. Shipping is $18 priority mail due to size and weight with the expansion included.  If you live close and I can get shipping cheaper, I will refund the difference in shipping costs.  I always try to get the cheapest shipping rate possible for my buyers!
Please Note: Plano boxes are not included with the game in order to keep the price down and the shipping cost down.   Those components will be placed in baggies.</notes>

    <notes>My collection is taking up too much room in my tiny Boston apartment, unfortunately. Selling games that don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see much play.
All components present and in excellent condition with virtually no wear; played once.  Box corners are a little worn, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it.
Buyer pays shipping from Boston, MA (or pickup can be arranged).  Please be aware that this game is a little larger than most others and is loaded with beautiful components, so shipping costs may be higher than what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re used to for other games.  Please contact me if you have any questions or need a shipping quote!</notes>

    <notes>CYCLADES COLLECTION - Includes all of the following:
1) Base game (2nd Edition)
2) Hades Expansion (inside base game box; no expansion box)
3) Titans Expansion (inside base game box; no expansion box)
4) Monuments Expansion (inside base game box; no expansion box)
5) Hecate
6) The Manticore
All in the base box, such that it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t close all the way (could probably close if insert was removed)
Core game was played, but none of the expansions have been played - now I have to sell to clear my shelves.
Shipping (USPS Priority): $15
I will ship within a day of receiving payment.</notes>
