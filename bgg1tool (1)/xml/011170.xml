   <description>This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pre-fab_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; army to the battle in order to save time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;HeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>NOTE: this is NOT a full set.  Just the Figures and character cards.  
I have an extra set of the unique figures from the main set, Rise of the Valkyrie.  They haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been removed from their plastic...thing...yet.  Take these off my hands, use them in Mimring vs Minring deathmatch battles, repaint and use them for your own custom cahracter designs, free up some shelf space at my house, and (MOST importantly) make my wife less angry with me for buying an extra set of Heroscape.
Shipping will be exact USPS price.</notes>

    <notes> 1st ed. Master Set (with those pretty sparkly water tiles!), complete except for original game box; everything else is present and accounted for. Also included in this sale are four small expansions: Knights _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Swog Rider, Kilts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Commandos, Devourers _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Minutemen, and Drones _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Minions (please note that the character cards for these two units are slightly bent, due to some overzealous package-tearing-into; this is the only defect that prevents me from listing the item as like new).
 This would be a perfect pick-up for either someone just getting started, as well as for a seasoned general!</notes>

    <notes>Brand new, box opened but nothing was taken out. The box isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t in brand new shape, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not broken down either. It has some bumps and scratches.
Shipping on this big box is your choice. I can ship it parcel or priority, UPS or FedEx. I tend to like USPS priority, but because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big box parcel might be better. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess around $12-15 shipping for US.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been opened but never played.  Pieces punched and figurines removed from the plastic tray(the flimsy plastic tray was thrown out).  All pieces are in new condition and all components are present and whole.  Shipping will be somewhere around 15 dollars as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big heavy box.  As an alternative to shipping, the game can be picked up in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Original Heroscape Rise of the Valkyrie Base set (the one with the sparkly water tiles).  Played with but complete.  Annoying plastic insert for figures has been tossed out though.  I will include two wave five expansion packs along with this as a bonus.  Shipping to the US will be $15 as the box is large.  Contact me about international shipping but it is likely to be prohibitively expensive.</notes>

    <notes>New, In Box - one flap opened, and items were slid out to get to the rules so I could read them, then all was slid back into the box, once I saw there was no good way to store this in the original box... it NEEDS a tub! :-)
Not sure of version, as I picked it up several years ago, at a Wal-mart. Can and Will dig it off top shelf of closet for pics, or questions if there is interest.
***Also*** look for my other listing: 
Expansion: Fortress of ArchKyrie - I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even have to read the box on this one, I bought 2 copies, and built one immediately (the built one was given to a Co-Worker before I quit as a consolation prize because he was going to have to manage EVERYONE instead of just his half of the 2 teams we were working with.) the one I will be selling/trading is sealed, or NIB, will check, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s on top of the main game on top shelf at the moment...</notes>

A squad of Grok Riders
All five figures from Orm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s return plus an extra Dund figure
Swog Rider
Major Q10 from Hive of the Marro
Shipping will be $15 via USPS and I will provide delivery confirmation tracking information when I create the label.
  
1st edition with the sparkly water.  All game materials are present and in very good condition.  The figures are stored in the original plastic packaging tray that came with the game (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably ship the tray outside the box as squeezing this all back in the original box might be a bit of an effort--they packed a lot of game material in to the box).  Game box has modest edgewear.
Shipping will be $11 to Eastern and Central US and $13 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>This is the First Edition, with sparkle water tiles and nice dice. Completed.
Internal condition is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as it has only been played twice and only the first scenario or two, never played the Master game, so the wound markers, order markers, grenade marker and round marker is still in the original plastic bag and not opened.
I have throw away the packaging/transport inserts that came with a new copy of the game, so the picture describe what is in the set. I have counted the pieces and it is completed.
There is one catch though, the box can be described as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, and there is some water damage on the bottom, I lay the box on the carpet in the basement, which got wet as there is a leak in wall when the sprinkler turned on...
Buyer pay actual shipping, plus a few dimes and nickles to cover gas (I usually round up to the nearest dollar). Suspect it will cost around $15 to ship this big box within the US.
International shipment will be expensive, so please inquire before buying.
Please geek mail me if you have any questions.</notes>

Hence the low price... probably best for someone who has this or other sets and wants to expand.
Postage £8.50 to Uk, thanks. Will be very expensive to mail elsewhere as total weight is over 3kg.
Or can collect in person in Twickenham area.</notes>

    <notes>Complete 1st Edition with Sparkly Water.
(NOTE: I also have an unplayed copy available.  Contact me for pricing.)
This listing is for my player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, but I take very good care of my games so you probably won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice any wear on the components unless you really look for it.  Of note:
All army cards are laminated.
External box has some wear (most of them do even when new).
Internal box shows some wear from sliding in and out.
I have several other HeroScape items available including:
Road to the Forgotten Forest
Fortress of the Archkyrie castle set
Various Expansion Figures
 =_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Inquire if interested
Items are from a smoke-free, pet-free home.
$15 shipping within the continental USA.

Postage will be £7.50 to the UK, a lot more to Europe (probably £20 minimum and increasing moving east).
I do not have the expansion boxes (well just the back of the boxes cut off so I remember what was there).

    <notes>I listed Heroscape as very good but it could be called like new. A little scuffing on outer box but the inside is excellent/new. This game has never been played. I have removed the inner box from the outer and looked at the dragon and T-Rex, but all terrain pieces, everything are still in original packing. This game just needs a good home.</notes>

Non-smoking, no-pet home.  Does not come with original packaging, otherwise all figures and components are in excellent condtion with one exception.
In one set: One 1x green hex was malformed when I purchased it; however, the deformity is on the side and does not interfere with gameplay.
I use USPS for shipping.  Buyer pays shipping from Ohio.  I will combine shipping for multiple purchases. I pay for delivery confirmation.  
Due to collectible nature, I require insurance up to purchase price; however, am willing to offer %10 discount for purchases over $100.  I have many other Heroscape sets listed.</notes>

    <notes>[b]This is not a complete set[/b]! 
I believe all of the figures are here. There are 30 + three Elite Onyx Vipers.
The box is fairly beat-up (with the top flap completely torn off). One of the army figures has a snapped foot which super glue should fix. Some of the terrain tiles are missing and the army cards that are there (see below) are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ok_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition. Certainly a playable copy, but worn. 
ALL of the figures are here (+ 3 Elite Onyx Vipers).
13 of the 16(17) Army Cards (w/Elite Onyx Vipers): Raelin the Kyrie Warrior, Finn The Viking Champion, Marro Warriors, Agent Carr, Syvarris, Elite Onyx Vipers, Zettian Guards, Airborne Elite, Sgt. Drake Alexander, Thorgrim The Viking Champion, Ne-Gok-Sa, Isumi Samurai, and the Krav Maga Agents (men in black).
10 of 12 combat dice (No 20-Sided die)
5 of the 10 Glyphs
16 of the 24 wound markers
1 of the 2 Ruins
Land Tiles:
All of the 24-Hex tiles (6 grass, 2 Rock)
All of the 7-Hex tiles (5 grass, 3 rock, 2 sand)
All of the 3-Hex tiles (5 grass, 3 rock, 2 sand)
All of the 2-Hex tiles (5 grass, 3 rock, 2 sand)
12 of the 16 1-Hex grass tiles
5 of the 6 1-Hex rock tiles

    <notes>Heroscape: Rise of Valkyrie
Hero scape: Swarm of the Marro
Heroscape Marvel: The Conflict Begins
I am selling off almost complete copies of each set. Rise of the Valkyrie is missing the instructions, dice, and some of the smaller tokens. One of the figures is broken. Swarm of the Marro is in the box bit missing most of the figure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards. Most of the terrain is intact. The Marvel set is missing Spiderman and one of the mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s is broken. Most of the terrain is there. 
This is sold as-is. I will not completely inventory. 
Bonus: RISE OF VALKYERIE DOES CONTAIN SPARKLY BLUE TILES.
Buyer agrees to pay USPS shipping costs.</notes>

NOT COMPLETE!!!!!!
Missing 10 of 30 figures.  INCLUDES: 16 figures on their bases; 4 figures that have separated from their bases; 2 unattached bases; 1 detachable dragon wing; 16 army cards; 12 combat dice; 16 order markers; one 20-sided die; 10 glyphs; 24 wound markers; grenade marker; round marker; 1 ruin (missing 1); 21 water tiles; all tiles except a 1-hex grass tile and a 2-hex sand tile; rulebook.

Box has seen its share of troubles as well, but is holding together.

    <notes>Overall, this game is in good shape. A few of the figures had curved spears/poles out of the box, but are fine otherwise. There is no box for this and 2 figures (Ne-Gok-Sa and Syvarris) are missing. I inventoried the game and all other components are present. I believe this has the sparkle water. Please let me know if you have any questions about this item.
Shipping and handling for this is $15.</notes>

I will ship USPS from 04011, expect it to be around $20 (probably less if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the Northeast, or we can arrange local pickup around Brunswick, ME).
Just want to add, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just looking for Heroscape parts/components/tiles, consider contacting Tim Bank through craigslist: http://madison.craigslist.org/wan/4175162337.html
He helped me complete my master set! (unfortunately, I think the game only makes sense if you have a place to keep the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;scape setup, and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t)</notes>

    <notes>There are three noticeable flaws: 1) The box has a minor, non-critical tear on the lid flap. 2) Two of the Army cards are slightly bent. 3) There is no _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Round Marker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (I believe it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a small black piece... I lost it early on and used a wound marker or coin in its place--not a big deal at all).  Because of this, I have attached a photo of these problems. Everything else is present and in very good condition. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this because I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played it in ages, and I want someone else to get good use out of it. </notes>

The box appears to be first edition.  The water tiles are sparkly.  I bought this used before I knew much about the game, so its complete, but a little mixed up between editions.  </notes>

Some wear from play on the cards. Zettian Guards card has a crease in it on the lower right end. One Krav Maga Agent (the woman) is leaning a bit and Grimnak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s spear is bent a little. Some terrain has initials in black marker on the bottom.

    <notes>Complete first edition with blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; red combat dice and all 21 sparkly water tiles. Includes original box, which has a lot of wear and tear (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;), but all components, including figures and character cards are in very good condition. The only exception is the game manual, which has a few creased pages (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d call it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead).
I can provide photos via email upon request.
Buyer pays actual shipping which must include a tracking number and insurance. Local pickup is possible along the Main Line or elsewhere in the Philadelphia area.
The Master Set box won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit into a standard USPS Priority Mail box, and shipping weight is more than 5 lbs, so Priority Mail shipping costs $20.75, and standard mail with tracking is around $18. FedEx to PA, NJ _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; DE as well as nearby states (like Maryland, Virginia _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; New York) may be a good bit lower. I can also ship without the Master Set box, which would reduce shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>This is a large collection. I will not spilt up the collection. 
This includes 1 copy of rise of the valkerie base game, swarm of the marriage base game, orm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s return deluxe expansion, as well as the following sets from mallidon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s prophecy (grit orcs, snipers and vipers, and heroes of bleakewood) and one copy of each set from fields of Valor. 
All units and some terrain are stored in the swarm of the marrow. The rise of the valkerie box is full of just terrain. 
Due to age, some terrain has broken and been thrown away. Some has cracked but still usable. About 90% of the original terrain is perfect. 
The boxes are large, so I would need a few days after the order to get a box. I would not expect payment until I gathered the box. 
The shipping might be high on this due to the box size. I will subsidize this cost as much as possible.</notes>

    <notes>On Hold for garrett10169.  Please do not purchase.
Complete set of Heroscape: Rise of the Valkyrie.  All components accounted for and packed neatly into box (see pics).  All pieces in excellent condition.  Our set has been very lightly used and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re the only owners.  Has been stored in climate controlled game closet.  Even the box itself has very little wear, although there is a bit on a couple corners/edges, but nothing abnormal or unexpected (see pics).   All figures still in excellent condition.  Most are bagged for protection with the exception of the 2 large ones.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included a green piece of felt, which you can see in one of the images, that protects the figures from damage and from moving around too much inside the box.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling a copy of the Volcarren Wasteland expansion here in the marketplace.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $35.00 for it but will give a bundle discount and include it for just an additional $20.00 if you purchase with this set.  Please geekmail me if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in this deal which will also save you on shipping.  You can look up the listing in the market if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to see pics.  
We have a smoke-free home and all of our games are very well cared for.  Will ship via UPS ground due to the slightly larger size of the box.  This generally gives better shipping rates.  Please geekmail for an estimate if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.</notes>
