   <description>The year is 1822.  After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall. As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, players must place two pieces on the board, either augmenting an existing building or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color. Finally, there are bonuses for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Medina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2014, Medina was re-released with new components, as well as changed and 2-player rules.

    <notes>Original german Hans im Gl√ºck  edition, but components are language independent. 
Box shows a bit of wear. Inside everything there and in nice condition, except one of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;inhabitant meeples_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; has been replaced. In exchange you get two extra wall pieces. 
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90‚Ç¨ worldwide and 8.60‚Ç¨ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>This is the 999 games (Dutch) edition which means the box has a different graphic and the rules are in Dutch. Components are language independent and the same as the Rio Grande and Hans Im Gluck versions (you can see the Hans Im Gluck logo on the back of the box).  I will provide you with a copy of the full english rules.
New and unopened in shrink (shrink has come loose in one spot, but game remains in perfect condition).

    <notes>Rio Grande version. This game is in excellent condition, as it has been played only once. All the pieces are included.  The box is in great shape, with the exception of a small dent in the lower left-hand corner. (almost unnoticeble) It has been kept in a smoke-free house. Shipping will be FedEx from Florida. </notes>

    <notes>999 Games - Medina
Language: Dutch
3 to 4 players
10 year and older
Duration: about 60 min
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,425 kg
Theme: Stefan Dorra has created a tense waiting game. Each turn you can place two pieces on the board, either augment an existing building or start a new one if the current building of that color is as finished as it will ever be. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to said building. Plus, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a little bonus based on the color you dominate in. Lastly, there are bonuses similar to the color-type for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.

    <notes># Condition
I played this game several times but I did not play it in the last couple of years. It is just not my game and I lack the players and time to play it more often. I want to remove it from my collection and find a new home for the game. There are some minor tears on the box but everything is complete and usable. Since it is some years old, it does not look shiny and new.
# Shipping
I will ship worldwide with DHL. Costs dependent on your location:
Germany:    4.50 ‚Ç¨
EU:         9.00 ‚Ç¨
Non-EU:    16.00 ‚Ç¨
Additional packaging costs: 2.00 ‚Ç¨
# Shipping time
I am full-time employed and can only send the package on weekends. If you are really impatient (and I do understand) then please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t order here, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to make you unhappy.
# Payment
Ideally via bank transfer with IBAN within EU states or paypal.</notes>

    <notes>NOTE: German edition.
Bought new, played once, put away.  
Contents in excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. Box has a little damage, a compression on the lid, a small ding on one corner of the base. Nothing terrible, just a knock in transit but not as new. No splits, no wear.
My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
Can ship quickly in the UK cheaply by courier.
Can ship quickish to the EU by Royal Mail
Can ship slowly by sea to the USA/Canada by Royal Mail cheaply. If you want airmail, that costs.
Other locations will research when I get an order.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
If you make the Paypal payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If you make the Paypal payment as a commercial transaction, I get charged near 4% of the payment because you get protection in a dispute. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously.</notes>

    <notes>A couple of small smudges on the box, pristine otherwise.
New, in shrink
Shipping:
I am happy to combine shipping on multiple items.
I can ship from both US and (if you are patient) Canada.
I will find the cheapest shipping method. Within the continental USA, this is typically Fedex. International shipping can be very expensive. 
Insurance and tracking:
I recommend paying for both of these. As a hobbyist and an individual seller, I cannot take responsibility for items that are damaged or lost in transit.</notes>
