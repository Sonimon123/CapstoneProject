   <description>A forgotten evil stirs in the ancient land of Varisia. Dark magic once more thrums amid crumbling ruins, giants gather in titanic armies, cultists murder in the name of foul deities, and maniacal goblins plot a fiery end for the peaceful town of Sandpoint._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Launch a campaign to strike back against the evils plaguing Varisia with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords - Base Set. This complete cooperative strategy card game pits 1 to 4 heroes against the traps, monsters, deadly magic, and despicable foes of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game's award-winning Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path. In this game players take the part of a fantasy character such as a rogue or wizard, each with varying skills and proficiencies that are represented by the cards in their deck. The classic ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) are assigned with different sized dice. Players can acquire allies, spells, weapons, and other items. The goal is to find and defeat a villain before a certain number of turns pass, with the villain being represented by its own deck of cards complete with challenges and foes that must be overcome. Characters grow stronger after each game, adding unique gear and awesome magic to their decks, and gaining incredible powers, all of which they'll need to challenge greater threats in a complete Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Path._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is an expandable game, with the first set containing nearly 500 cards. The Rise of the Runelords - Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card Character Add-On Deck expands the possible number of players to 5 or 6 and adds more character options for any number of players. The game will be expanded with bimonthly 110-card adventure decks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Errata: Early printings had the Loot card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Sihedron Medallion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; listed as belonging to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;  (for Base Set). It is instead supposed to read _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (for Burnt Offerings ). (It is unknown if this has been fixed in later printings)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Brand New Shrink Wrapped copy of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game
Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier(3-5 working days) with a charge of £5.50 for this item. 
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.

Dark magic once more thrums amid crumbling ruins, giants gather in titanic armies, cultists murder in the name of foul deities, and maniacal goblins plot a fiery end for the peaceful town of Sandpoint. Launch a campaign to strike back against the evils plaguing Varisia with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Base Set. This complete cooperative strategy card game pits 1 to 4 heroes against the traps, monsters, deadly magic, and despicable foes of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s award-winning Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path. Choose your character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s class; build a deck of allies, equipment, and magic; and explore lethal locations as you journey through multiple scenarios in an exciting fantasy adventure. Characters grow stronger after each game, adding unique gear and awesome magic to their decks, and gaining incredible powers, all of which they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to challenge greater threats in a complete Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Path. </notes>

    <notes>I will include the character add-on deck for an extra $10!
Hello!
I am selling a once-played copy of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (and barely played at that--I did not even complete my solo session before I realized this was, unfortunately, not the game for me).
This copy INCLUDES EXTRA COOL STUFF: 4 copies of a quick reference card, 2 copies of a front/back rules reference sheet and 2 copies of a different version rules reference sheet, as well as printouts of all 11 character reference cards available at Paizo.com (otherwise, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be writing on your cards).  These sheets and the instruction booklet I have placed into a new folder that stores neatly in the box.  Additionally, I have separately bagged each of the card types and the 5 dice in 4mil game baggies.
I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even opened the included _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Burnt Offerings_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Adventure Pack #1 that is included in the base game.  Again, if you would like to purchase the character add-on deck as well, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw it in for an extra $10.
Additionally, I have clear-taped the corners of the box with Scotch Brand packing tape to prevent corner wear over a long life of play (completely invisible but a useful trick) and I have already repacked the game in the original well-fitting Amazon.com box with original air bag packing, and included extra packing for a safe trip.
Please contact me if interested and note that buyer will pay shipping (I will ship whatever method is preferred, box dimensions are 17.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x14.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and it is approximately 4.5lbs).  The shipping cost will be added to the total and can be sent via PayPal.
Please contact me with any questions, and thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Pathfinder ACG base game.
Cards were only played in sleeves.
As shown in the picture, the base of the insert has been cut off to fit sleeved cards. It still works fine for non-sleeved cards, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s obviously not like new.
The box weights about 1.8kg and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in any USPS flat rate box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll wrap it in bubble wrap and the in brown paper, so the weight will be above 2kg. Mailing from 95054 if you want to get an idea about shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords - Base Set, all five adventure deck expansions and 3x promo cards.
Game has been played through, but the cards have only light wear. No bending, tearing or folding, only wear around the edges. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve taken a photo of some of the cards from one of our character decks, as they should have the most wear, as an example:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ey5qc0sacg5oezb/Pathfinder.jpg
(download it from Dropbox for the full-res version)
None of the character cards have been written on (we sleeved them and wrote on the sleeves)
Included is:
The base set, including the Burnt Offerings adventure deck
All 5 extra adventure decks
     The Skinsaw Murders
     Hook Mountain Massacre
     Fortress of the Stone Giants
     Sins of the Saviors
     Spires of Xin-Shalast
Three promo cards
     Birdcruncher Crown
     Goblin Plate +1

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included £10 postage and packing in the price for delivery to the UK. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in Europe then contact me so that I can get a quote for the shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This is the base set PLUS the character add-on deck.
The game is in like-new condition. All the cards have been sleeved since purchase and are in perfect condition (the sleeves are NOT part of the sale). The game has been played only a few times. The box is in great condition (no wear) as is the insert.
This is the first game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling on BGG so unfortunately I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have a rep. However, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had good interactions with members when I sent out  items around the world for fellow bgg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s to bling out their Mage Knight game.
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1125610/found-very-nice-acrylic-rocks-replacement-plastic/page/1
I realize that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not a direct rep for selling something but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see I sent the items to several bgg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s (just for cost) since I had extra items that could be used for their game. Maybe that helps earn a bit of trust :)</notes>

    <notes>Played the game a few times with my kids and had a blast.  We just haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played it in months.  Paid about $20.77 per Adventure deck from Paizo to get the promo cards too.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve invested at least $160 in all for this game ($45 for base game + $15 for character add-on + $100 for 5 adventure decks).  At Coolstuffinc_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s current prices, you could buy everything new for around $121 without the promo cards.
Character Add-on deck - Cards opened, and played a few times
Adventure Deck 1 - Cards opened, and played a few times (Included in the base game)
Adventure Deck 2 - Cards opened, but not played. + Blessing of Zarongel Promo Card

All the decks have been played through and there is light wear on the cards, as well as the game box.  Many of the expansion deck boxes have tears due to the tight packing and my fat fingers.  Sorry!
Depending on where you live, shipping costs $9-30.   Feel free to ask for the exact cost.  Games get mailed USPS Priority and typically go out the business day after payment is received.</notes>

    <notes>Selling the base game plus all six expansion decks and the Character add-on deck.
Cards were always played sleeved, so condition is near mint.
Some cards very slightly warped, but can be easily flattened out and if sleeved this would not show.
Would prefer shipping to the United Kingdom, but will gladly ship elsewhere (buyer to pay actual shipping costs).
Would prefer a bank transfer instead of PayPal.
Any questions, please ask.

What you get:
The base set, the add-on character pack, and the six adventure packs (each one with its promo card)!
About the condition: the big box is okay; it was not pristine to begin with anyway. The seven packs are opened but present. The cards were not sleeved. The campaign was played three times by component-loving adults, in a smoke-free, kid-free, food-on-the-table-free environment. All the cards are accounted for, and sorted back in their packs, so the campaign can be started with no fuss.

    <notes>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Complete Set! 
Despite the listing title/categories, what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m actually selling here is the complete set of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Rise of the Runelords_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. Also, aside from the base set and all six adventures, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including several add-ons, promos, and accessories. 
The copy you will receive has seen plenty of play, however as described below, all cards have always been sleeved and protected. All game pieces included have minor--if any--wear. The game box is in great shape and includes a custom fit, wooden, insert to organize all of the cards and components neatly within. Please, be sure to check out the rather lengthy list of everything included below and also the pictures I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added to this listing!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVERYTHING INCLUDED:
x1 Rise of the Runelords Character Add-On Deck
x1 Rise of the Runelords Base Set(includes Adventure Deck 1: Burnt Offerings)
x1 Adventure Deck 2: Skinsaw Murders
x1 Adventure Deck 3: Hook Mountain Massacre
x1 Adventure Deck 4: Fortress of Stone Giants
x1 Adventure Deck 5: Sins of the Saviors
x1 Adventure Deck 6: Spires of Xin-Shalast
(This is the base set and every adventure for the entire _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Rise of the Runelords_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; adventure set. It also includes a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Character Add-On_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pack which adds more playable heroes to the game--along with some other neat stuff.)
Promos:
x2 Fire Sneeze
x1 Poog of Zarongel
x1 Blessing of Zarongel
x1 Dance with Squealy Nord
x1 Birdcruncher Crown
x1 Grindylow
x1 Horsechopper +1
x1 Goblin Plate +1
(This is a COMPLETE set of the promos that released with the original Rise of the Runelords adventure set--along with an extra Fire Sneeze. Typically from my experience, these were only given out if you had a subscription through Paizo or during conventions.)
Accessories:
* Wooden Organizer Insert w/ adjustable slots
* x11 Player Mats(individually themed for all eleven Heroes sold within this set)
* 15 Die (x3 D4, x3 D6, x3 D8, x3 D10, x3 D12)
* Fully sleeved - The grand majority of cards here are sleeved with Dragon Shields(black). Any double-sided cards(such as Hero sheet cards) are sleeved with penny sleeves.
Official Pathfinder Collectible Minis:
Valeros - Beginner Box - #1/4
Ezren - Beginner Box - #2/4
Kyra - Beginner Box - #3/4
Merisiel - Beginner Box - #4/4
Lem - Shattered Star - #38/55

Seoni - Rise of the Runelords - #35/65
Lini - Legends of Golarion - #38/55
Sajan - Legends of Golarion - #44/55
Seelah - Heroes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Monsters - #27/40
(Basically, there is a miniature for every playable hero included within this game. Aside from being awesome minis, these are what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve used as Hero tokens instead of the card tokens that are included by default. For reference purposes, they are listed by the miniature_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s name, the set they come from, and their numbering within that set.)

    <notes>This is for the second edition base set and all adventure packs. It also includes the character add-on deck and the neoprene playmat. Promo cards from the Wizkids pre-painted miniature boxes are included as well as Wizkids Pathfinder Iconic Heroes pre-painted miniatures for all Rise of the Runelords characters (including those from the character add-on pack). This also includes a Broken Token insert in the box (original insert not included). There are a few other promo cards (like the spell Fire Sneeze) but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know where they are from. As far as I can tell, this includes everything ever made for the Rise of the Runelords campaign.
I will pay for shipping to the continental USA.
The box has a small puncture type mark on the lid (but the cardboard is still there, so not a full hole).</notes>

    <notes>No significant damage. It has been played to completion but we are very careful with our games. Very slight shuffle scuffing. No significant damage to box.
Box weight approaches 2Kg so postage will vary wildly worldwide. Please contact me for details.
I cannot 100% guarantee no cards are missing but I very much doubt it.
Note I am also selling all 5 of the other RotR adventure decks, and the character add-on deck separately,</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ruffled through (and sorted) the cards a few times, but never got around to playing this game, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to find a new home! Everything is in like new condition. See the picture attached for the actual game you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship this via USPS, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay the actual postage. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the continental US, priority mail should get it anywhere for $20 or so, but we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see based on your location!

    <notes>English first edition
Includes Adventure Decks 1-4.
Includes Poog and Horsechopper promo cards.
Very good condition. All cards have been played with, almost always solo, unsleeved. But they are in very good shape, with minor wear expected from play. Box is in great shape.
The box is big and heavy; shipping approximately 8+ pounds from 94124.</notes>
