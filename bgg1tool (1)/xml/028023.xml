   <description>Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Setting: Jamaica, 1675._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;colleagues_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;good old days,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;holds_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;captain,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and which to the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;night._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; - and one on the right (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;night_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;combat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;gunpowder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Raise the sail and straight on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;til morning. 
How else could the honorable Henry Morgan celebrate his 30 years of governing Jamaica than with a race around the island? Gathering every Pirate and Buccaneer around, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; will be a memorable race. Not to mention - what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better than a race where you can earn some booty and shoot at your opponents? The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what! The goal is to sail around the island of Jamaica as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). And so, hoist up the sails and head towards Port-Royal. May the fastest and richest win!</notes>

The goal is to sail around the island of Jamaica as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). And so, hoist up the sails and head towards Port-Royal. May the fastest and richest win! </notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Jamaica
Description: Jamaica from GameWorks. Used/complete, first edition.
Shipping Weight: 5 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>All components accounted for and bagged.  Player cards still shrink wrapped with the exception of treasure cards which are bound with bondage tape to help protect them during shipping and to keep them together in the box. This is a first edition of the game. 
Game has not been played.  There is a small amount of whitening on the corners of the box.  
This looks like a really fun family game but I assumed would be too simple for the people I normally game with and it has  just sat on the shelf.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time for someone to enjoy it!
My price includes shipping to your door.  Thanks for taking a look!</notes>

Raise the sail and straight on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;til morning. How else could the honorable Henry Morgan celebrate his 30 years of governing Jamaica than with a race around the island? Gathering every Pirate and Buccaneer around, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; will be a memorable race. Not to mention - what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better than a race where you can earn some booty and shoot at your opponents? The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what! The goal is to sail around the island of Jamaica as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). And so, hoist up the sails and head towards Port-Royal. May the fastest and richest win!

Raise the sail and straight on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;til morning. How else could the honorable Henry Morgan celebrate his 30 years of governing Jamaica than with a race around the island? Gathering every Pirate and Buccaneer around, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; will be a memorable race. Not to mention - what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better than a race where you can earn some booty and shoot at your opponents? The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what! The goal is to sail around the island of Jamaica as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). And so, hoist up the sails and head towards Port-Royal. May the fastest and richest win! </notes>

 Raise the sail and straight on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;til morning. How else could the honorable Henry Morgan celebrate his 30 years of governing Jamaica than with a race around the island? Gathering every Pirate and Buccaneer around, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; will be a memorable race. Not to mention - what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s better than a race where you can earn some booty and shoot at your opponents? The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Great Challenge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what! The goal is to sail around the island of Jamaica as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). And so, hoist up the sails and head towards Port-Royal. May the fastest and richest win! </notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition. Only played a few times, and everything accounted for.
Originally, 4 sets of instructions came with the game, in 4 different languages.
I only kept the English, and discarded the rest. So the English instructions come with the game.
Reasonable shipping rates.</notes>

    <notes>Thanks for looking at my listing! This is for Jamaica. It is a fun game that I like playing, but I am trying to make a bit of extra money to help me get through my last summer semester at university. 
Everything is in great condition. There is just a bit of wear on the top corners of the box from taking it to and from game nights. Basically, just a little white is showing through from the cardboard, but they are not at all  torn or ripped. Nothing is missing from the box contents. Please let me know if you have any questions!</notes>

For shipping this is considered a medium-large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Punched, cards sleeved, played once. Box has very light shelf wear, components in excellent condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium-large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

Overall in very good condition. Small ding on box, rules are a bit wrinkled from folding/unfolding, no issues with game components. Played a few times. My copy was bought in 2011, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t match the box listed as the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;English/French edition 2010_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, it matches the box listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Multilingual second edition (2013)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but the description on that photo states _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Jamaica 3rd edition box art, revealed February 2010_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; so not 100% sure which version I have.

    <notes>CONDITION: Played a few times. Box has some shelf wear. All components present and in great shape; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s frankly a stunning game. Smoke-free home.
SHIPPING: I estimate between $8.50 and $13.50 for USPS Priority, but we can discuss other carriers if you like. I can ship within 2 business days of payment clearing. If you live near Pittsburgh, we can make an arrangement to hand-off and avoid shipping costs altogether. I am happy to combine shipping should you have an interest in other items of mine, just let me know!
PAYMENT: Payment is via Paypal, Popmoney, or Venmo. I will also accept a USPS money order.</notes>
