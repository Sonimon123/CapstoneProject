   <description>This is the 4th game in the Alea medium box series. It is the second game by Viennese designer Andreas Pelikan, where _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;players will have constantly changing roles from the druid Drax to the assistant Gemalher. Players who come after you in turn will always have the better cards!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A simultaneous-selection (but then sequential play) card game. Players select 5 of their 12 role cards to play per set. Then they reveal them in sequence. Each role has a main full action and a less valuable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;favor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; action. If you are the first player with that role you announce that you are that character. If you follow after but choose that same role card you can take the favor action instead, or declare that you are that character in hopes that you can command the full action. You risk having it taken from you by a later player, though. The different roles help players collect different ingredients and money to make potions listed on the cauldron cards. When everyone's five role cards have been played and actions taken, another five cards are chosen for the next set and the process repeats as before._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ages 9 and up, a 2 on the Alea scale._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Treasure Chest adds 3 expansions. The 1st expansion adds cards for a 6th player, as well as raven tokens to signal the game's end. The 2nd expansion adds amulets to increase the excitement in 3-player games. The 3rd expansion adds 17 magical ability cards to make certain roles particularly attractive._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Imcludes the expansion stuff from the Alea Treasure Chest. 
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

A couple corners of the box have moderate wear, the previous owner wrote their name and phone number on the inside of the lid, and for whatever reason, the edges of the green player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards show bit more use than the other four sets.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink.  I had this shipped over from England, but it is the Rio Grande edition in English. (Ended up with 2 copies.) There is a 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tear in the shrinkwrap along an edge, but no dings/dents.
Shipping will be a maximum of 10.95 (USPS Priority Medium flat rate), and any excess over actual costs will be refunded. </notes>

    <notes>The box is in great shape (just some very light wear).  Pictures available upon request.
The game is complete and the components appear like new. This is the English version.
As a bonus, this will include the hard-to-find Essen 2008 promo expansion Der brodelnde Theriak (which has it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s own entry on BGG) - which is worth about $10 new on its own. </notes>

    <notes>Contents: One copy of the English edition of Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew, plus one copy of the English edition of the Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew expansion from Alea_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Treasure Chest, plus one copy of Wie verhext!: Der brodelnde Theriak (original printing, not a do-it-yourself printing).
Condition:  I received the original game and both expansions in a trade.  The components had light wear on them at the time, at which point I sleeved everything.  All games are complete.  Der brodelnde Theriak has been cut carefully with scissors but is complete.  (That was the only way to use it)  I hate to part with this, because I like it, and my price reflects that.  Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew is a lot of fun for 3-6 people.  I even have some wooden crow/raven-eeples to use in place of the cardboard tokens that come with the expansion.
Shipping: This game weighs 3 pounds.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice between USPS Priority Mail and USPS Parcel Post (both are insured and delivery confirmed).  For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $12 depending on how far you are from Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders.</notes>

    <notes>THIS GAME HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.
Contents: One copy of Wie verhext! (Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew), Alea/Ravensburger German edition. With the pictography on the cards, Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew is easily playable in a foreign language. I will laser print you a nice rule booklet in English. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look at the rules the first time you play and then probably never again!
Also included: One copy of the Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew expansion from the English edition of the Alea Treasure Chest.
Condition: The base game is new in shrink. THE GAME BOX HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE, a result of poor packaging when the game was originally sent to me. The best way I can describe it is that one edge of the box has been compressed, creating a crease along the entire long edge of the box top. There is also a small ding on one of the bottom corners. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m making this sound worse than it is because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want a buyer coming back later and saying that I was untruthful somehow!
The expansion has no box. It is a complete set and has never been played.
Shipping: This game weighs 3 pounds packaged. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice between USPS Priority Mail and USPS Parcel Post (both are insured and delivery confirmed). For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $10-15 depending on how far you are from Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders.
Just so we are clear, this game is in shrink, and there is a SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.</notes>

    <notes>THIS GAME HAS A MODERATE AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.
Contents: One copy of Wie Verhext! (Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew), German edition from alea/Ravensburger. Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew has great pictography and as a result is completely language independent.  I will laser print you a nice rule booklet in English.  Also included is an English copy of the Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brew expansions (from the RGG/Alea Treasure Chest).
Condition: New in shrink. THIS GAME HAS A MODERATE AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE, a result of poor packaging when the game was originally sent to me. The edges of the shrinkwrap are scuffed, a couple of the corners have some smush damage, and the box top is concave with a crease down the long edge. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m making this sound worse than it is because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want a buyer coming back later and saying that I was untruthful somehow!  Despite the condition of the outer box, the contents will be minty fresh when opened.
The expansion has never been used and is good as new.
Shipping: This game weighs 2-3 pounds packaged. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice between USPS Priority Mail and USPS Parcel Post (both are insured and delivery confirmed). For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $12 depending on how far you are from Indiana.  Shipping to Canada is around $30.

    <notes>Rio Grande English Edition.
Opened, punched, components like new. Played a few games but the cards show no wear. Includes the Treasure Chest expansions (which are completely unused).
The box lid has two small indentations in the finish - they are so minor that I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even photograph them. Basically, imagine what it might look like if someone pressed the side of their thumbnail along the finish for an inch or so. They aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t scratches (they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t break the finish or damage the art underneath) but they are small indentations.
Shipping will be by USPS Priority for $8. I can also do free local pickup in the Sacramento/Davis area.
I will get this packed and shipped within one business day of payment.</notes>

INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance. (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)

    <notes>Includes [gameid=165354], from the Alea Treasure Chest
Please note - one wooden heart token split over time and has been replaced with a cube.  These are the equivalent of cardboard coins in a game, it makes no difference to play (but some people care a lot more than me, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing every defect).</notes>
