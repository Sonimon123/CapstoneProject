   <description>From Z-Man Games Webpage:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan! You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. You will learn stories and gain wisdom to share with others. Will you be the first to fulfill your destiny? The next Tale is yours to tell! There is, of course, a winner in Tales of the Arabian Nights, but the point of the game is less to see who wins and more to enjoy the unfolding and telling of a great story!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this new edition of the groundbreaking storytelling game, you enter the lands of the Arabian Nights alongside Sindbad, Ali Baba, and the other legendary heroes of the tales. Travel the world encountering imprisoned princesses, powerful 'efreets, evil viziers, and such marvels as the Magnetic Mountain and the fabled Elephant's Graveyard._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you: become beloved, wealthy, mighty - even become sultan of a great land. Choose foolishly, however, and become a beggar, or be cursed with a beast's form or become insane from terror! YOU will bring to life the stories of the inestimable Book of Tales in this vastly replayable board game with over 2002 tales that will challenge, amuse, astound and spellbind you for years to come._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Tales of the Arabian Nights_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7031)
Designed by Eric Goldberg
In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan! You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. You will learn stories and gain wisdom to share with others. Will you be the first to fulfill your destiny? The next Tale is yours to tell! There is, of course, a winner in Tales of the Arabian Nights, but the point of the game is less to see who wins and more to enjoy the unfolding and telling
of a great story!
In this new edition of the groundbreaking storytelling game, you enter the lands of the Arabian Nights alongside Sindbad, Ali Baba, and the other legendary heroes of the tales. Travel the world encountering imprisoned princesses, powerful _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;efreets, evil viziers, and such marvels as the Magnetic Mountain and the fabled Elephant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Graveyard.
Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you: become beloved, wealthy, mighty - even become sultan of a great land. Choose foolishly, however, and become a beggar, or be cursed with a beast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s form or become insane from terror! YOU will bring to life the stories of the inestimable Book of Tales in this vastly replayable board game with over 2002 tales that will challenge, amuse, astound and spellbind you for years to come.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7031)
Designed by Eric Goldberg
In Tales of the Arabian Nights, you are the hero or heroine in a story of adventure and wonder just like those told by Scheherazade to her spellbound sultan! You will travel the land seeking your own destiny and fortune. You will learn stories and gain wisdom to share with others. Will you be the first to fulfill your destiny? The next Tale is yours to tell! There is, of course, a winner in Tales of the Arabian Nights, but the point of the game is less to see who wins and more to enjoy the unfolding and telling
of a great story!
In this new edition of the groundbreaking storytelling game, you enter the lands of the Arabian Nights alongside Sindbad, Ali Baba, and the other legendary heroes of the tales. Travel the world encountering imprisoned princesses, powerful _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;efreets, evil viziers, and such marvels as the Magnetic Mountain and the fabled Elephant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Graveyard.
Choose your actions carefully and the skills you possess will reward you: become beloved, wealthy, mighty - even become sultan of a great land. Choose foolishly, however, and become a beggar, or be cursed with a beast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s form or become insane from terror! YOU will bring to life the stories of the inestimable Book of Tales in this vastly replayable board game with over 2002 tales that will challenge, amuse, astound and spellbind you for years to come.
This edition of the game has nearly 2000 more paragraphs than the original edition. 
Z-Man have added variants to the game which can be downloaded on the right. Please note that these variants are not rigid: use what you need to get the best enjoyment out of this game.

    <notes>Opened and played a few times but in excellent condition - Z-Man Games version.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $8.00 (this sucker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy!). If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

Complete. With a few small exceptions, all of the components are in excellent shape. Those exceptions are:
The encounter card for Daybul ended up with a bent corner.
The board shows a bit of wear in the center and also suffers from some warping.
The box has its share of bumps and dings.
Shipping details will be sent via geekmail.

Game will be packed with care. 
Buyer pays actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred. International buyers must also cover insurance (usually only $2-3 extra) to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>It is played but complete and in great condition. 
The only negative to note is a few of the Trait cards feel like they have a rough surface. This is due to the cards protective _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;varnish_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; not being correctly applied. This has zero effect of gameplay. Trait cards are never shuffled, randomised, or secret, they are selected and displayed openly based on outcomes of the story. 
A print out of the official errata is included and some of these changes have been made in the book so they are not missed during gameplay.
Shipping will be £7 to the UK. </notes>

    <notes>Played only a few times, great condition. Includes laminated sheets to track effects and skills on (rather than using all of the tokens) but also comes with a nice Plano box to store all of those counters. Includes other reference materials as well.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Due to the weight and size, domestic US shipping will be actual cost (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess $15-$20) (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>Game is in very good condition - played a handful of times carefully.  
Payment via PayPal, or cash for local pickup.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of GMT war games and other classic boardgames. </notes>

    <notes>Listing for user ComtriS only.
The game has been played twice and is in very good condition. The box shows little to no wear. As for the components, only the book of tales shows a small amount of usage wear. The rest shows little to no wear.
The cost for shipping will be my actual cost to ship from 95008. Feel free to geekmail for a shipping quote. Local pickup in San Jose, CA, is available as well. 
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>A fabulous new edition of a real classic and one of my top ten games of all time. It takes you into the world of the Thousand and One Nights to create your own tale to match those told by Scheherazade. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your chance to be Aladdin, Ali Baba or Sindbad. Brilliant stuff in a big, heavy box.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £35.00 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.
