   <description>Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town heroes head-to-head against a horde of zombies. A team of four heroes is chosen by one set of players, and the zombies are controlled by one or two players. Each hero has its own special abilities. The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel. The game also comes with a CD soundtrack of original thematic music._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each hero has its own plastic sculpted miniature. The game also has 14 zombies in two colors. Other objects and effects are represented by high-quality cardboard counters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF 0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless dead…scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death… is becoming infected.
 
Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds.
So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth!
Players - 2-6 Players
Ages - 12 and older
Time - 60 – 90 Minutes</notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF 0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless dead…scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death… is becoming infected.
 
Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds.
So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth!
Players - 2-6 Players
Ages - 12 and older
Time - 60 – 90 Minutes</notes>

    <notes>Played once, everything is in like new condition.  However, it is MISSING THE CD.  This does not effect gameplay as it was just background music.  
I ship USPS or FedEx, whichever is cheaper or whichever you prefer and charge actual shipping rounded up to the nearest dollar to help defray packaging costs.  This should be between 5 and 6 pounds to ship and ships from 80919.  </notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF 0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless death -scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death... is becoming infected.
Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds.
So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth! </notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions - Last Night on Earth
Language: English
Players: 2-6
Age: 12+
Duration: 60 to 90 min
Weight: 2.000 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town Heroes head-to-head against a limitless horde of Zombies (players can play on the Hero team or as the Zombies). A modular board randomly determines the layout of the town at the start of each game and there are several different scenarios to play, adding lots of replayability. Fast Paced Game Play with Easy To Learn rules allows players to jump right into the action, while Strategic Depth and Strong Cooperative Play keeps the game interesting. To achieve a horror movie feel, all of the art for the game is photographic and the game comes with a CD Soundtrack of original music.

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF 0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless death -scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death... is becoming infected.
Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds.
So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth! </notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF 0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless dead…scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death… is becoming infected.
Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds.
So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth!

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless dead...scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death... is becoming infected. Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds. So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth! </notes>

    <notes>No insert but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve put everything into plano boxes so that the heros and zombies only need one tray infront of them, just makes it so much easier to set up.
Great game, enjoy it a lot, I just need the space in my cupboard and that is the only reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling.</notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF0101)
 
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless dead...scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death... is becoming infected. Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds. So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth! </notes>

    <notes>The game has been played once. The advanced Hero _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Zombie decks are still in shrink. The components are complete and in very good to excellent condition. The box has some shelf wear, a small tape-caused tear on the side, and a 2 to 3 inch minor tear along one top edge, but otherwise still as sturdy as ever.
This will ship in a medium, flat-rate box ($11.30)
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined). I only charge exact shipping costs and will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520. </notes>

    <notes>This is a bundle of an opened, gently played copy of The Last Night on Earth base game (only played on a single occasion by two adults; complete) and a sealed copy of the Growing Hunger expansion (in its original clingwrap). I enjoyed my one time playing with it but unfortunately my storage/living situation is changing and I need to let these go--my loss is definitely your gain in this instance!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $47 for both and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take care of the shipping within the continental U.S. Not only will you be getting a great deal on a great bundle but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also be supporting a feel Geek (and my wife will appreciate your help in thining the horde)!
Thanks for your interest!</notes>

    <notes>Flying Frog Productions (FYF0101)
When night begins to fall on the sleepy town of Woodinvale, the shadows and fog rolling in bring with them more than just a chill shiver. A living nightmare erupts as the once peaceful community is overrun with the restless dead...scratching and clawing their way to the surface with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Now only a handful of unlikely Heroes are left, banding together to fight for their very lives. On a night that never ends, the only thing worse than death... is becoming infected. Last Night on Earth, The Zombie Game is a fast-paced game of brain-eating Zombies, small town Heroes, and horror movie action. Players take on the role of either the Heroes, working together to make it through the night; or the Zombies, unending waves of undead spreading over the town like a plague. Featuring a modular board, eight Heroes to choose from, and several different Scenarios to play that drastically change the game, Last Night on Earth is designed to create a cinematic feel as the story and game unfolds. So put down that popcorn, grab your shotgun, and hide your brain; the Zombies are coming and this could be your Last Night on Earth! </notes>

    <notes>Hi guys, new copy of Last Night on Earth with the Growing Hunger Expansion! All components complete and in pristine condition as if the shrink just came off.  Both the base game and expansion are in the same box (I threw out the Growing Hunger box and kept all of its components in the base game box).  I want someone else to enjoy it since its collecting dust in my house, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it for $35 (shipping will be an additional $10.00), that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s less than half the price of buying both the base and the expansion together! hope you fun with this game!</notes>

See final photo to see him.  The cards are very crisp, in like-new condition. The box is also in great condition with no split corners and very little dishing, and a bit of wear.
Also includes printouts of two official additional web scenarios, the FAQ, and a couple of player aids.</notes>

    <notes>INCLUDES EXPANSIONS:  Growing Hunger + Survival of the Fittest
(All pieces combined with main set in original box. All rules included)
Condition: Game is in excellent shape, only played 3-4 times. Box edges show average use and some shelf wear. No original insert, but all parts fit in the original box and the heroes and many of the small bits are in locking plastic craft boxes (see photos).
8 of the 12 hero minis are painted. The others are primed, but some have dings in the primer, so may need a fresh coat before painting. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a decent amateur job (see photos).
Includes original soundtrack in its jewel case.
Ships from Sacramento via your preferred method. It fits in a medium flat rate USPS box, which is probably your best bet, as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quite heavy.</notes>

SHIPPING:
   USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.</notes>

    <notes>Includes base game, Growing Hunger Expansion, Survival of the Fittest Expansion, Hero Pack 1, and Zombies with Grave Weapons miniatures set.
All are in excellent condition.  Have been played, but I take care of my games, and 99% looks brand new.  Boxes have shelf wear on the corners.
I currently have it in 2 boxes (base, growing hunger), but can take out the insert if you want to reduce shipping cost by sending only 1 box.  Shipping at most would be $18.75 (fits in a large USPS flat rate box).  If you would like a better estimate of shipping, shoot me a geekmail and we can see what I can do.</notes>

Hi Matt,
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m closing some of the auctions early due to a scheduling issue and to give you a chance to get the shipment out before I go out of town. I messed up the end date of the auction.
If we can speed through the confirmation process and figure out shipping and payment I can try to get your package out by Wednesday. Otherwise I will have to ship on April 19th.
Sorry for the mix up and thanks for your bids
Jason
