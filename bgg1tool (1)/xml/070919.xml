   <description>A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor. Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members (the players) with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The Panda and the gardener
The players take the role of courtesans of the Nippon emperor. They take care of his Giant Panda by growing a bamboo plantation. 
Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow. In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card. 
The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game.

The Panda and the gardener. The players take the role of courtesans of the Nippon emperor. They take care of his Giant Panda by growing a bamboo plantation. Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow. In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card. The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game. </notes>

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping. If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences. Happy shopping!</notes>

The Panda and the gardener. The players take the role of courtesans of the Nippon emperor. They take care of his Giant Panda by growing a bamboo plantation. Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow. In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card. The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game. </notes>

For amyarvita
*PLEASE READ*
I am sending a Marketplace order for each item. If you have won multiple games, you will get multiple orders. You can purchase each one individually or wait to purchase them all at once. This will not change shipping cost. All combined shipping orders will be exact cost. If you won only one item you will pay the listed shipping cost as described in that item.
THANK YOU!</notes>

    <notes>This is for the collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s edition. I purchased this game used and have only played it once. The game components are in excellent condition. The wooden outer box has some scratches and blunting of the corners as a result of poor shipping. This is a heavy item and shipping will cost about $30 to addresses in the US. Local pick-up is available in the Indianapolis area.</notes>

This offer is only for selling the promo pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Alternate Art Player Boards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameaccessory/186541/takenoko-alternate-art-player-boards
This promo pack includes 4 individual boards for the Takenoko game that are interchangeable with those of the base game. Each of them presents a panda drawn by a different artist. Here lies its originality!
You will find:
- The gourmet Panda of Naïade (illustrator of Seasons, Tokaido)
- The panda in Japanese print version of Pierô (Mr. Jack, Dice Town)
- The panda in its lush jungle of Marie-Anne Bonneterre (La Chasse aux Gigamons)
- And finally the lazy panda of Miguel Coimbra (7 Wonders, Hyperborea).
Just to be clear: this offer does NOT include the full game, what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling here is only this promo.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played three times.
This game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards have been sleeved.
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>

    <notes>Box has a fair amount of shelf wear, but is still sound.
Components are in very good to excellent condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not positive of the edition as there are no dates to be found. However, it is in English only, and there are three publishers printed on the box: Matagot _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Bombyx, and Asmodee is included in the rules.
NOTE: There the needed 20 irrigation channels (wooden sticks), but 5 were missing when I obtained this copy. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added 5 -white- sticks that are very close in size to the blue.
This is a medium sized game, so unless you are near southern Oregon on the west coast, shipping will be $13.95 (medium, flat-rate USPS)</notes>
