   <description>In remote times, King Gradlon had the magnificent city of Ys erected for his daughter Dahut. Gargantuan sea-walls protected the city from the violent waves. Dahut decided to make Ys the most powerful place in Brittany; thus, she dispatched dragons to seize merchant ships loaded with jewels which sailed on the open sea_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, ships filled with gems land in the city's ports. The players, embodying merchant-princes of Ys, set their team to work, two at a time, in the 4 neighborhoods of the city; deciding which area of each neighborhood to focus on. Controlling the port to claim special black jewels, the commercial area to gain a financial advantage or the palace to influence characters of influence. However it is the player who dominates the neighborhood as a whole who has the first choice of the precious stones carried in the hold of the ship docked there.  Don't overlook the gem market as other players may send their brokers to influence the value of the different types of jewels, making your collection less valuable._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player has a team of 11 brokers of varying skill levels. These brokers are placed on the players turn, one face up and one face down. Bluff your opponents on where your intentions lie, misdirection is the key to victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has accumulated the most gold (represented by victory points)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>SAVE OVER 30% ON THIS PRE-ORDER (Rio Grande Edition)!!!  
Remember, this is a pre-order so the game(s) will not ship from our store until it has officially been released!!!  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s current due date is:  December, 2005 (note, this date may change!)
Be sure to make this purchase separate from any others if you wish to have us send all in-stock games before this release.  Otherwise, we will wait till all games requested have arrived in store!
Items are shipped within one or two business days upon reciept of payment (remember, money order, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check or cash at your own risk!) If you do not wish to send payment and would rather pay us directly, you can give us a call at 816.554.7333 (Tuesday through Saturday) using Visa, Mastercard and American Express or by contacting us in order to make a Paypal payment (a 4.5% surcharge will be added to the total payment.)

If you need a specific type of shipping - such as Overnight or with Insurance - or have any  questions, drop us an email. MO orders pay 7.35% sales tax.  </notes>

Length: 60 minutes
Game Description: In remote times, King Gradlon had the magnificent city of Ys erected for his daughter Dahut. Gargantuan sea-walls protected the city from the violent waves. Dahut decided to make Ys the most powerful place in Brittany; thus, she dispatched dragons to seize merchant ships loaded with jewels which sailed on the open sea...The players embody merchant-princes of Ys. By skillfully using their network of brokers, they speculate on the purchase of precious stones, thus amassing gold (represented by victory points). At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has accumulated the mostgold.

I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not much of a difference in price, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll go priority. If you order several games from me, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping.
Shipping cost is $6 to anywhere in the US (probably more if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in Alaska or Hawaii, but I have no experience in that area). If you order a bunch of stuff, the shipping cost is still $6! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to make room here!</notes>
