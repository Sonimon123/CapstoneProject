    <notes>I am selling this game for a friend of mine, Suzanne.  It has been played once by her and her parents and the pictures enclosed will show that it is like a brand new game.  Please see pictures enclosed, as I consider this an important part of your purchasing decision... and you also would want to see the full condition of the game, right?
*
Note: Personal checks MUST clear BEFORE shipment takes place and the game will be shipped directly by Suzanne to your doorstep.  However, I will be handling the payment transaction for her, so payment will be made out to me.  I will notify Suzanne immediately upon payment being received and she will make ready to ship the game ASAP, pending the payment clearing.   Shipping and handling costs are $9.50 and unfortunately I do not do anything with PayPal.  I do apologize for the inconvienence for those people who use that as a primary form of payment. To be fair, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in a big hurry for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;A Game of Thrones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; game and a check or money order is not convienent, you may want to check other options.

    <notes>Played a few times, no wear and tear on cards (which are sleeved).  This is one of the earlier editions, so the cards are not linen-coated, they are flat-coated.
Coming with this game is the Clash of Kings expansion, which has the same condition.  You cannot choose to have one and not the other.
A free game, the published edition of Gods, will come with this set.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA03)
Claim the Iron Throne and the lands of Westeros! 
Based on the best-selling novel series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, the A Game of Thrones board game lets players take control of one of the great Houses of Westeros and embark on a epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne. Immerse yourself in a game of clever planning, careful allocation of power, diplomacy, and the exciting flavor of A Song of Ice and Fire.
When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. 
—Cersei Lannister

    <notes>I love this game but can never get folks to play it up here in Alaska.  Check out the two expansion packs I have for the game as well.  One of them is not even punched (third one).
Shipping will be $11 in the Medium flat rate shipper. If you get more than one of the game ask for a quote.  I do combine and work to get the cheapest method.
I use Priority Mail shipping. For one reason the cost of a box would have to be added to the shipping price if we didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use USPS Priority Mail. Two it is slower any other method. SO since you are paying for a box might as well put out an extra $1.00 or two to send it faster.
Thanks for looking.
International shipping ask for quote.</notes>

    <notes>*Includes the base game and both expansions (Storm of Swords and Clash of Kings)*
(The price is for the base game and both expansions, combined)
This does not come with the boxes from the expansions or any of the inserts; All games are in the main game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box.  The main game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box is in excellent condition. All pieces and cards are present and sorted and are in very good to excellent condition.  Boards and rulebooks are present and in very good condition. Comes with a minor bonus of a small plastic sword, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to use it instead of the cardboard one (which is also still there). 
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.

Complete and in very good condition.
You pay all shipping charges.  For domestic shipping, this game can be shipped inside a medium Priority Mail flat rate box for $11.00.This method also does not include insurance, which can be added for $1.75.  I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged shipments if you do not purchase insurance.
Please note that the Priority Mail flat rate box does not allow for much padding, so if you are concerned about damage during shipment you may want to have it shipped by another method.  I will ship by any carrier you prefer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping for multiple items.  I have quite a few games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling, but it is taking me a while to list them, so e-mail me for a complete list.  Use zip code 98104 to calculate shipping costs.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to arrange for local pickup in the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia area.
I will ship anywhere, by your choice of carrier, however there is a $10 surcharge per international shipments above the cost of shipping to compensate me for the additional time involved in shipping internationally.  Note that this is per shipment, so if you buy several games from me and have them shipped together, you just pay once.  Sorry to have to do this, but international shipments are much more time consuming for me than domestic shipments.
Payment by PayPall only, except for local pickup which must be paid in cash.  Sorry, no checks or money orders.</notes>

Theme: TKing Robert Baratheon is dead, and the seven kingdoms brace for war. House Lannister, whose daughter Cersei was Robert_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s queen, claims the throne for her young son Joffery. From the Dragonstone Isle, Stannis Baratheon knows that Robert was not the true father of Joffery, and rightfully demands the throne for himself. On the Iron Isles, House Greyjoy is about to embark on a second rebellion, but this time with a much grander goal. In the north, House Stark gathers its strength to defend what is right, and in the south the wealthy House Tyrell harbors an old ambition to sit on the Iron Throne. As armies gather and ravens fly, a clash of kings is inevitable. Based on the best-selling novel series A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE by George R.R. Martin, the A Game of Thrones board game lets players take control of one of the great Houses of Westeros and embark on a epic struggle to claim the Iron Throne. Immerse yourself in a game of clever planning, careful allocation of power, diplomacy, and the exciting flavor of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE.

    <notes>This is a first edition printing of the game.
There are a few shelf wear spots on the corners of the box, but it is otherwise in pristine condition.  I have bagged all the associated pieces so you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need to rummage through to find them all (I had to do this when I received it in a trade; it is a pain).  
Since the DVD for the first season of Game of Thrones comes out soon, this is a good time to pick up the game </notes>

    <notes>the game is component complete aside from 2 Baratheon order tokens. I have made a complete set of printed and spray mounted to card, replacement tokens.
Box is a little worn, but functionally fine. Board is fine, some of the power tokens are a little worn, cards are fine.
This is just the first edition, NO expansions
postage for UK will be;
£3.50-4.50 for collectplus
£5.20 Royal Mail standard Parcels
£8+ for 1st class
more for tracked and signed
Will post to europe but at a higher cost. It weighs under 2kg though so it will be a sane price.</notes>

    <notes>GAME DESCRIPTION: Box in almost perfect condition (small ding to one corner of box bottom). Pieces have been inventoried and are all present. Punched, sorted and bagged. NEVER PLAYED!
NOTE: I also have CLASH OF KINGS and STORM OF SWORDS expansions for sale also (separate listings). Order one or both of these along with the base game and get a discount on game prices and shipping costs! Message me for details.
SHIPPING: Shipping to USA locations will use USPS Priority Mail 2-Day Delivery (comes with tracking # and up to $50 insurance coverage). Mailing cost for a typical game will be around $10.00 or less for most USA locations. Heavier games will be more expensive, but you can choose Standard Mail (delivery time 5-7 business days) to get a lower shipping cost. Send me a message with your ZIP Code to ask for a firm price. Shipping discount available for multiple items on the same order (contact me for a price). 
PACKAGING: Your game will be packaged carefully so that it arrives in the same condition as you ordered.
INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Please send me your City and Country for a shipping price quote.</notes>
