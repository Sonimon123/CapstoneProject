   <description>While the headline game, M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;, is the main attraction, this deck of custom cards comes with rules for several games:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml; - A complex trick-taking game. For 3-6 players, ages 12 and up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Last Panther - A trick-taking game similar to Hearts, where players try to avoid negative points. For 3-8 players, ages 10 and up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Wimm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;ln - A trick-taking game where players must estimate how many tricks they will take, akin to Oh Hell!. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Rumm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml; - A Rummy-like card laying game where players try to get rid of their hands by playing high-scoring combinations of cards. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Safar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml; - A card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;catching_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game using basic adding skills.

For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up. Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml; is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.  Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mü _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Lots More includes a a tweaked version of M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml; and a different set of games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Opened, but not played.  Game is language independent, but instructions are in German.
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>Shrinkwrap removed but never played. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money.

    <notes>This is the Doris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Frank german edition. I removed the outer shrinkwrap to include the english translation - it is made into a booklet and is the same size as the box so it fits perfectly. The cards are still factory sealed. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>This game is not in shrinkwrap and the deck of cards is not wrapped. However, I think it came this way. As a habit, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t unwrap games until I play them, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never played this. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t open decks to examine them and then put them away. So I think it must have been delivered like this.
Bought new, played never, put away.  My copy comes with a print out of the English rules. In excellent condition, only listed as LN as it has been opened.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.
On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>
