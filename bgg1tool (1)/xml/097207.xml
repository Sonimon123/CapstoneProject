   <description>Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but the profit is unbelievable._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others). To become the leader of imp family that has just started a new business, they will have to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs represented by cards in order to sell them as grown scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points. </notes>

    <notes>The game is absolutely excellent condition with no noticable wear to the box or any of the components. It has only been played once.
We_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re selling this game off cheaply as we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re about to move and are trying to get everything cleared out beforehand.
Shipping is 2nd Class - £4.50. Shipping is a little high due to the weight.
Shipping to Europe - £12.00.

    <notes>The game and components are in excellent/ like new condition.  The game has never been played so the player shields have never even been folded.  The monsters are, assembled.  The only reason this is listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is because the the lid has a small tear (1-2in) on on of its sides.  Apart from that, the box itself is in excellent condition.  The game and components are unimpacted.  let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Selling my copy of Dungeon Petz. Its in excellent condition. All pieces are punched, but we only played the game once. I would normally call this _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; but I see that the condition policy says that if the pieces are punched, it can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be considered like new, which makes sense to me. 
Shipping anywhere within the US will be $15.</notes>

I ship daily and will ship your item the next day after receiving payment. I will only charge you the actual cost of shipping. Most normal size games fit in a flat rate box and ship for $12, while some larger items may cost more. Some very small games will cost less. I will ship worldwide, but understand that shipping packages outside of the United States is very expensive. Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>Box was damaged.  However, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still a solid box.  The game is all there and has never been played.  The main board is slightly warped.  If you really want the game to play, and not collect, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perfectly fine.
I want to get this to the table myself, but my price is set for somebody who wants to get it to table more than I do.  It looks like a wonderful game!</notes>

    <notes>Czech Games Edition (CGE00015)
Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business - breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them - but the profit is unbelievable. Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points.</notes>

    <notes>Czech Games Edition (CGE00015)
Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business - breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them - but the profit is unbelievable. Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points.</notes>

    <notes>Czech Games Edition (CGE00015)
Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business - breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them - but the profit is unbelievable. Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points.</notes>

    <notes>Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business – breeding and selling petz. Sound simple and safe? Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them – but the profit is unbelievable.
Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords. In the meantime, they also attend various contests in which they show off their pets, scoring additional points.</notes>
