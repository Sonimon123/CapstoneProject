Will you answer the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s call?
In the ancient Citadel of Monarch City, the King calls to arms the finest Heroes to defend against a Darkness that engulfs the land. You and your allies must embark on a journey to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat the four creature factions before one of them enters the City. And they approach from all sides! Fast populating Orcs! Fierce Dragons! Undead that bring Terror! And Demons! All tainting the land in their wake. There are several paths to defeat, but only one path to victory, and only the most valiant Hero will be named King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Champion.
Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King’s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defense of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory!

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Our Liege is in desperate hour! From what grievous cause have these accursed races arisen? Orcs, Dragons, Demons and the Dead make haste towards Monarch City. The King and Countryside of Monarch City is in need of valiant Heroes!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Will you answer the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s call?
In the ancient Citadel of Monarch City, the King calls to arms the finest Heroes to defend against a Darkness that engulfs the land. You and your allies must embark on a journey to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat the four creature factions before one of them enters the City. And they approach from all sides! Fast populating Orcs! Fierce Dragons! Undead that bring Terror! And Demons! All tainting the land in their wake. There are several paths to defeat, but only one path to victory, and only the most valiant Hero will be named King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Champion.
Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King’s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defense of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory!</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Our Liege is in desperate hour! From what grievous cause have these accursed races arisen? Orcs, Dragons, Demons and the Dead make haste towards Monarch City. The King and Countryside of Monarch City is in need of valiant Heroes!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Will you answer the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s call?
In the ancient Citadel of Monarch City, the King calls to arms the finest Heroes to defend against a Darkness that engulfs the land. You and your allies must embark on a journey to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat the four creature factions before one of them enters the City. And they approach from all sides! Fast populating Orcs! Fierce Dragons! Undead that bring Terror! And Demons! All tainting the land in their wake. There are several paths to defeat, but only one path to victory, and only the most valiant Hero will be named King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Champion.
Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King’s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defense of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory!</notes>

    <notes>Got this for Christmas along with pandemic. Where I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a Biologist the theme of pandemic is more to my liking. However there is one factor that I enjoy more about Defenders of the Realm. Its co-op like Pandemic though you have more control over what you do. You can choose to go on solo quests and beef up your hero thus making a bigger solo contribution to the group. A little more lateral freedom would of been nice in Pandemic. The game has been played 3 times, its practically new minus the shrink wrap. I found the playing time to be shorter then advertised which was nice. With four players our 3 games timed at: First game took 80 mins (win), 2nd game took 35 mins (lost) 3rd game took 48 mins (win).
The theme of the game oozes with fantasy which is nice if your a fantasy lover. My wife sadly isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t thus one more reason Pandemic will get played more then this one.
Shoot me an email if interested or a (reasonable) OBO.
Happy Gaming!</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Our Liege is in desperate hour! From what grievous cause have these accursed races arisen? Orcs, Dragons, Demons and the Dead make haste towards Monarch City. The King and Countryside of Monarch City is in need of valiant Heroes!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Will you answer the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s call? In the ancient Citadel of Monarch City, the King calls to arms the finest Heroes to defend against a Darkness that engulfs the land. You and your allies must embark on a journey to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat the four creature factions before one of them enters the City. And they approach from all sides! Fast populating Orcs! Fierce Dragons! Undead that bring Terror! And Demons! All tainting the land in their wake. There are several paths to defeat, but only one path to victory, and only the most valiant Hero will be named King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Champion. Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defense of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory! </notes>

You and your allies must embark on a journey to defend the countryside, repair the tainted lands, and defeat the four creature factions before one of them enters the City. And they approach from all sides! Fast populating Orcs! Fierce Dragons! Undead that bring Terror! And Demons! All tainting the land in their wake. There are several paths to defeat, but only one path to victory, and only the most valiant Hero will be named King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Champion.
Defenders of the Realm is a cooperative fantasy board game in which 1-4 players take a role as one of the King’s Champions (Choose from Cleric, Dwarf, Eagle Rider, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard). You, as one of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Heroes make use of strategy, special abilities, cooperation, card play and a little luck in Defense of the Realm for a unique experience every adventure. But be forewarned! There is never time to rest. As each Enemy General is struck down in battle, the remaining dark forces only grow more difficult to vanquish and their march to Monarch City gets faster with each Hero victory!

    <notes>*** Complete Game, verified 4/14/2014 ***
Game box and all components are Like New. Included in the box is the Barbarian figure and card. The game was played only once.
Buyer pays actual shipping costs. USPS Priority shipping in a box is estimated at $18. The game is big and has some weight.  If you want to use a different shipping method please ask. I include tracking and insurance to protect both of us.
Local pickup is always an option and a great way to save on shipping costs. I live in Chantilly, VA (20151) and work in Mclean, VA (22102).
Please ask if you have any questions.

    <notes>This is for a large lot consisting of:
The Defenders of the Realm base game
The Dragons Expansion (unplayed, unpunched, cards still in shrink), and
The Barbarian figure expansion
Base game is complete and in good, painted condition (see pics). *****There are some places (see pics) where the paint has come off the minis I painted. This happened when stored in a hot car and they stuck together a bit.*****
Dragon expansion is complete and cards/cardboard still in shrink/unpunched/unplayed (no box)
The Barbarian expansion is new, still in plastic it came in.
The base set has been painted entirely. This is somewhere around 100 figures. This includes the heroes, the villains and all the cultists that came in the base game box. The paint on the cultists is fairly simple, but I think it distinguishes them greatly.
All of this is contained in the base game box. I tossed the box for the Dragon expansion long ago.
I will not split this up to sell separately.
AGAIN, and IMPORTANT- this is all contained in the base game box. No box is available for the Dragon expansion.
See pics for details. Let me know if any questions.
Will probably be around $25 to ship. Is heavy and a large box.</notes>

    <notes>Defenders of the Realm bundle:
base game
Defenders of the Realm: The Barbarian
The Defender of the Realms base game was played several times. All cards were played in sleeves (Sleeves are not included). On all the boards (except main board) I put self-adhesive foil. Back in the day there were no sleeves for the quest deck, so I laminated those cards. Tokens and Miniatures sorted in zip bags.
The Barbarian Promo is also covered with self-adhesive foil and was played 3 times.
I accept SEPA credit transfer and Paypal (for Paypal add 2€!).
Insured shipping to Germany: 6€, EU: 16€, Europe w/o EU: 29€, rest of the world: either 35€ or 42€ (depending on country)</notes>

Please note: I typically ship USPS Priority mail.  However, this is a large, awkward box, so shipping will be expensive. For those on the west coast I estimate costs to be $25-$30.  It will be less expensive for those on the east coast.  My zip code for shipping estimates is 23188.  Once I know your zip code, I will be able to provide you an accurate shipping cost</notes>
