In it, each player controls a dragon striving to diminish the other whilst bound together by the Tao; you manipulate tokens on a special board in order to activate your dragon, leaving that same board to be manipulated by your opponent on their turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Among customizable scenarios and increasingly profound modes, both dragons will move, attack, block each other's way and seek dominance.

    <notes>KS deluxe edition - has a sleeve with a mountain scene over the red magnetic box. Map is made of mousepad material. All board pieces are made out of wood. 
Includes 4-player Expansion, Tiger _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Phoenix expansion, Fluffy Expansion, and 4 Seasons Expansion. Comes with two metal yin/yang coins (possibly a mistake?). 
Played maybe 10-15 times, but everything in like new condition since it is made of sturdy wood. Instruction manual may be less crisp than a new one, but it is undamaged. 
Buyer pays shipping from 92010, which likely means $12+ to west coast and $20+ to east coast.</notes>
