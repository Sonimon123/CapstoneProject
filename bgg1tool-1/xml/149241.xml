   <description>Assault on Doomrock is a co-operative adventure game set in a humorous fantasy world. Players start the adventure by generating random heroes from two cards. Combinations like sadistic paladin, stinky warrior, frustrated mage or impatient rogue are only few of the possibilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The unique party of heroes will venture forth into a randomly assembled world map. While gaining crazy abilities, and searching for gold and ridiculous items, heroes must face three increasingly difficult encounters. These battles play out in a grid-free, highly tactical battle system that uses character positioning, dice and ability cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of the game is to defeat the third epic boss encounter. In order to do that, heroes must carefully exploit the map to grow as powerful as possible before they run out of time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Feature highlights:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Fully cooperative board game, with card driven artificial intelligence._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Variable heroes and scenarios, generated from over 300 cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Grid-free, highly tactical battle system, with dice allocation planning phase._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Fully randomized adventure on the world map, with quests, events, shops and rewarding exploration._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Heroes with 8 random traits. 74 unique ability cards. 70 item rewards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    9 possible battle encounters, each with their unique artificial intelligence deck, which gives over 30 battle encounter combinations. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Link for eBay feedback in signature line.
I love this game, but it plays too long for me and as a result it just will not see the table very often.
Please notice in the pictures that the box insert is slightly damaged.  It still functions fine, it was like this when I opened up the game new from the factory shrinkwrap.  To sort of make up for this, all 246 of the small cards are sleeved but none of the larger cards are though(there is only 50 of those(didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have sleeves that fit).</notes>

    <notes>Includes the kickstarter version of Assault on Doomrock 2nd edition as well as the Doompocalypse expansion.  The components from the base game and the expansion have been combined into the base game box; the Doompicalypse box as well as redundant extra cards (such as the smaller versions of the bosses) have been thrown away.  The inserts have been thrown away.  The game has only been played once: it was fine but it just wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me and I have other adventure games.  Will ship anywhere in the United States.

    <notes>Hi everyone, 
I am currently selling both the original game as well as the expansion for it all in one box.
I have placed the expansion box inside the original box and removed the insert that it originally came with. The original box has some damage to it on the bottom right corner from initial shipping.
The game has only been played once, so the wear and tear is basically non existent.
I would prefer an Australian buyer as it is much easier to ship that way, but I am happy to find out the shipping cost regardless of your location.
All of the regular cards have been sleaved with clear plastic ultra pro_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, but not the smaller cards.
In regards to payment: While I have written paypal, if you are in Australia it is probably easier to just do a bank transfer. You can do bank transfers from overseas as well, but normally overseas bank transfer fees are quite exorbitant so in that case I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d suggest just using paypal.
Thanks for your consideration.</notes>
