    <notes>Folklore the Affliction is a dark fantasy role playing board game for 1-5 players that does not require a game master. Adventure in a land steeped in fear, myth and superstition. Hunt or be hunted by creatures of antiquity and legend. Explore dangerous locales to find clues to the sources of evil sinking claws into the heart of the land, and decimating the populace. Defend the weak from the scourge of witchcraft and the demonic, the taint of lycanthropy and vampirism. Advance through highly immersive stories of epic scale with multi-layer character development in an on-going quest to drive the darkness back into the hell from which it came.
The game has been played a couple of times, but everything looks like new. All the characters have been painted, as well for some creatures (see picture). To see what is exactly included in the big box (9 kg), go to the kickstarter page. Here is a listing:
Includes Folklore: The Affliction core game, KS exclusive pack, the following add-ons: Ghost Miniature Pack, Character Record Pad, Encounter Record Pad, Alternate Color Kickstarter Exclusive Pack, Oversized Neoprene World Map, Recipes and Crafting Card Set, Seasons Environments _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dark Festivals Card Set, FIVE (5) Player Mats, and the Colossal Dark Oak affliction! - PREMIUM PLEDGE

    <notes>This is essentially a Mythic level pledge from the second Kickstarter plus some add-ons.  It was a Premier level for the first Kickstarter, minus the extra set of minis and plus one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mystery Box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, and a Farmer level for the second, plus AME the Corruption and five additional trackers.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been opened and played a few times, but in excellent condition and many items are still in their original bags and boxes. All KS exclusives are, of course, included.  Loved the game but my group did not and I need the shelf space.  Photos available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>RESERVED AT THE MOMENT! :)
I am selling a late pledge _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bundle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of the 2nd Kickstarter printing including:
 - Core Game, 2nd Printing
 - Dark Tales Expansion
 - Miniatures Box Set
 - Talisman of Kremel (Metal Coin and Dice Bag)
 - World Events Card Pack
 - Equipment Pack
 - Recipes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Crafting Pack
 
I just removed the shrink wrap from the boxes and the cards and flipped through the rules. Everything else is literally untouched. Game seems to be exzellent, but the dark-horror-theme is just not my cup of tea,
Shipping costs for an insured and trackable parcel between 20 - 25 Euros, depending on the destination. Please ask me for the exact shipping costs :)</notes>

    <notes>This listing is NOT FOR THE GAME, but rather, the oversized world map neoprene play mat.
Please note that I will ship this in a card board tube to reduce any further creasing.  I have had this mat out on my table for several months to flatten it out however, there are still some light creases from the original packaging of the map.  Otherwise this play mat is in great condition and could probably be ironed flat without much trouble.</notes>

    <notes>Comprises the whole 333$ usd Kickstarter pledge. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it because I have no time to play. We played two times, so the condition is very good. Note that I discarded packaging that could not be used anymore (lots of stuff was individually wrapped), but everything is carefully ordered in the main boxes. Some stuff is still wrapped, in fact. It comprises a lot of stuff, everything available for the game:
Folklore The Affliction (Core Game)
Folklore The Affliction: Dark Tales
Folklore The Affliction: Nightmare Adventures
Folklore The Affliction: Adventure Creation Kit
KS Exclusive Metal Leader Token
