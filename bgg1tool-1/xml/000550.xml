   <description>Barbarossa, in Italian _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;red beard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by the fantasy trilogy Die Schule der R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;tselmeister (School of the Riddle Masters), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Barbarossa und die Ratselmeister (1988) from ASS
Box: Light shelf-wear and a few minor dings and wrinkles. Overall the box is in excellent condition!
Contents: One of the pencils is not original and the clay is a bit hard (it IS over 20 years old!) but everything else is here and in excellent condition! The board shows a little wear from use, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about the only real issue. The clay is easily replaced with some Play-Do or some cheap stuff from the dollar store. This is the classic version and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a fan of the game, you really should have a copy in your collection!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>RESERVED!
This game was never played. It is the Kosmos edition with the Spiel des Jahres 1988 seal on the box. I removed the shrink-wrap and taped a corner of the box because it was damaged when it was shipped to me. The board and other components are in mint condition. The modeling clay is still shrink-wrapped, but as with any modeling clay it may be hard. I would think that whenever you actually play this game you would want fresh play-doh. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>
