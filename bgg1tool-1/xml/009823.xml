    <notes>opened, but unpunched/unplayed. There is some highlighting in the rulebook. It is not highlighting through whole sentences, but bracketing paragraphs in the rules and some notes of what to pay attention to when playing.
Included as a bonus are copies of ASL modules from some old Generals. I am not sure if they are adaptable to the starter kit, but they are there anyway. They are:
ASL Scenario K: The Cannes Strongpoint from The General vol. 25, no. 2
ASL Scenario L: Hitdorf on the Rhine from The General vol. 25, no. 2
ASL Scenario S: The Whirlwind from The General vol. 28, no. 4

and
Scenario Briefing: Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Notes on ASL from The General vol 29, no. 2
Finally I had printed up some various stuff from BGG and the internet that are in the box too as extras. They are:

ASL Starter Kit #1 is a self-contained module which will let players start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately. A liberally-illustrated rules tutorial teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL.
June 7, 1944... On D+1, the 101st Airborne found itself embroiled in a two-fold effort: consolidating its units which were scattered all over the Cotentin Peninsula and establishing a firm eastern perimeter to protect the American landing at Utah Beach. Vierville, which lay a few miles inland from Utah Beach, had been liberated by American units on D-Day. Vierville was a major traffic thoroughfare since the southwesternly road which passed through Vierville led from Utah Beach to the German strongpoint of St. Come du Mont. On the morning of June 7, elements of the 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR moved out from Vierville towards St. Come du Mont, leaving Vierville virtually unoccupied. The Germans took this opportunity to launch a series of counterattacks on Vierville in hopes of cutting the road to St. Come du Mont...  
September 26, 1942... During the summer months of 1942, German forces had advanced nearly unchecked across the Russian steppes. With Russian resistance west of the Don River broken, Hitler ordered Army Group B to capture Stalingrad. Using the traditional German tactics of lightning thrusts and envelopment, and with the Russians retreating before them, Sixth Army commander Paulus sent an armored spearhead into the suburbs of Stalingrad in an attempt to quickly capture the city. The German tactics failed inside the confines of the city, however, as the Russians were able to dig in and fight from every building. The initial spearhead blunted, the Germans committed more units and soon realized that this was a very different battle from what they had been fighting. The confines of the city stifled manoeuvre, and German superiority in artillery, air power, and armor were rendered ineffective as the infantry of both sides intermingled while fighting for each block of the city. This was Rattenkrieg--the war of the rats.

    <notes>ASL Starter Kit #1, #2, and #3.  
#1 is punched with the counters stored in 2 covered counter trays.  I am not the first owner of the game, but everything is in great shape.
I believe #2 and #3 are unpunched (but I can verify if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m culling the collection to get down to a more manageable size.
I would prefer to ship within the US, however, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to discuss international options.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

READ THIS, please.
1) Will ship anywhere at cost.  Insurance/tracking, if available, at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s discretion and expense.
2) I will ALWAYS combine shipping.
3) I am ALWAYS open to offers if you’re considering a multi-game purchase.  Do me the courtesy to extend a genuine offer and I will consider it seriously and provide a courteous response.
4) I can sometimes ship from the USA and save US buyers some $$ on shipping - just Geekmail me and ask when I will next be in MN.  For large purchases I can make a special trip to the border but, please, do not ask me to drive there and deal with the Customs thugs (both ways, mind you!) to save $6 on a $20 purchase.

This means that scenarios 4 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 5 will be short 2/1 counters respectively (unless proxied or using VASL, obviously :) )
The expansion pack provides enough spares to allow these two missions to set up.
Rulebook is sellotaped together, info card is laminated, counters are clipped.
Also contains a spare map v, extra info counters and SK#2 sheet 2.</notes>

If You´re a German buyer, just read the text below (“…innerhalb Deutschlands gilt:..”)
Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

    <notes># Condition
I never played this game. It is just not my game and I lack the players and time to play it more often. I want to remove it from my collection and find a new home for the game. I unboxed the game and removed the counters (but not clipped them). It is basically like new.

Germany:    4.50 €
EU:         9.00 €
Non-EU:    16.00 €
Additional packaging costs: 2.00 €
# Shipping time
I am full-time employed and can only send the package on weekends. If you are really impatient (and I do understand) then please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t order here, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to make you unhappy.
# Payment
Ideally via bank transfer with IBAN within EU states or paypal.</notes>

    <notes>*** With every sale we donate a percentage to the Veterans Support Foundation (including this sale). ***
Wargame Depot has donated over $8,000 to this wonderful cause thanks, largely, to the wonderful Boardgamegeek community. Thank you so much for your continued support of Wargame Depot which has allowed us to give generously to the VSF.
Mint, in shrink copy available.  No dings, no dents, or anything wrong with the game.  Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
$12 shipping to US - write me for a quote to the rest of the world.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so a purchase from me will always be packed professionally and I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
And if you want this game plus anything else that I am selling on BGG, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course be happy to add other items on in order to save you on shipping!
North Carolina residents pay 7% sales tax.
Cheers,
Jason
PS:  We have many Osprey books in stock not listed on BGG.  The prices are well under publisher rates; if you are interested in them, please let me know!</notes>
