   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;decksploration_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;role_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;run_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s obstacles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; Asylum _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the box, an insert allows players to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;save_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Official FAQ_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Expansions were published in this order:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Asylum (base game) (2015)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition – Endurance (2017) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;T.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMSCTS01US)
Time Stories offers a unique blend of role-playing and board gaming experience. It is a decksploring game, and each deck of 120+ cards is a new story to explore. The players are agents in a futuristic TSA (Time Survey Agency) that detects time discrepancies and sends you on mission, usually to prevent temporal rifts. Each mission is different, being set in a different atmosphere and illustrated by a different artist, with each mission having a core mechanism that differs from the next. You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time... Time Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!</notes>

    <notes>Deck of cards ONLY!!! This listing will not include the box, manual, or any other components.
This deck, along with a copy of the rules (digital or printed), and some misc components (which can be pretty easily improvised), is all you need to play TIME Stories. The board is nice, but is really just a collection of outlines to organize the cards.</notes>

- Games are shipped via USPS Priority Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise, at which point we can discuss shipping. 
- I exclusively use PayPal and PayPal invoices. Please do not pay me until I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sent you an invoice. 
This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail.</notes>

    <notes>Leider weiß ich nicht genau, ob es sich nun um die erste oder zweite Edition handelt. Die Regeln sehen identisch zur aktuellen Version auf dem Geek aus. Das Spiel wurde einmal durchgespielt mit der _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Nervenheilanstalt_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, d.h. minimale Gebrauchsspuren könnten vorhanden sein. 
Das Inlay hat in einer Ecke auch einen kleinen Riss, aber hält die Komponenten nach wie vor sehr gut zusammen.

    <notes>The game comes from a private collection (non-smoking and pet-free environment).
It has been opened but never played. All components are in excellent condition. The tokens are still unpunched.
The box lid is still in its original shrink wrap for extra protection. It can be easily removed in case you find it unnecessary. I’m simply very picky about game condition and like to give my games this extra protection :)

Everything is in excellent condition but I listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because I know some people (myself included) can be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; picky.

    <notes>Played through the game all in one go a couple of years ago, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sat on the shelf since then. Time to find a new home!
The plastic insert is a bit cracked in places, which is how it was when I took it out of the shrink, and a fairly common issue with this game. Everything still is held together well though, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve heard you can get a replacement if you contact their support. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship via USPS, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay the actual shipping cost from 48895 to your location!
 I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to combine shipping - please check out the other games I have for sale and send me a note to work out what the total would be!</notes>

    <notes>Includes Under the Mask (new), Lumen Fidei (no separate box, stored in Base box), and Asylum (in Base box).  Base box has no insert.  One of the small player pawns was chewed by my dog, so the buyer will need to use one of their meeples or other token to represent that pawn.
Ships from Hawaii in flat rate box, so most US cities will have a shipping charge of $19.</notes>

    <notes>This would be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; except for the fact there is a crack in the insert (pictured). The crack was there when I bought it new. It never impeded storage in the insert, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just noticeable. Otherwise, the game is in AMAZING shape. My group only the Asylum _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Marcy Case. Under The Mask _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Prophecy of Dragons were obtained during a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Trade Day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; at my local FLGS, but both are in excellent condition with the decks organized to their original state (was one of my conditions for the trade I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want any spoilers LOL).
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 7.5 pounds so figure an extra pound or so of packing material. This will also not fit into a Flat Rate Box with the expansion boxes. If you would like to avail yourself of Flat-Rate Shipping, those boxes will need to be jettisoned ;P
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:

Prophecy of Dragons (used, very good condition)
Under the Mask (new in shrink)
Special Reward Promo
Printouts of fillable note sheets (very useful)

The boxes for the expansions have been removed and all cards are organized in the main box. The main box insert has been removed and all components are bagged. While the insert was a nice idea, I found the pieces would get mixed up far too easily. Also, storing everything in one box is an incredible space saver.
Excellent set for someone looking to get a start on the series.
