   <description>In Urland, players compete to get their creatures on land. One player selects which land area is scored in a turn while other players use a number of actions to move their creatures around. At certain intervals on the scoring track, gene modifications are auctioned which offer additional actions to the players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Opened and played a few times, in excellent condition. Includes printed English rules. Also includes the expansion genes.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>I sell Urland from from Doris _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Frank with the expansion, german edition.
The basegame has been played only once, the expansion hasn’t been played at all. Components are in top condition and complete. non-smoker household, no pets.
Since this offer includes base game and expansion, I put this offer in both BGG entries: Basegame and expansion.
If you live in Germany you can pick up the game in Duisburg and pay cash, otherwise the buyer pays the shipping costs, only bank transfer.</notes>
