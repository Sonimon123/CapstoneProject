   <description>Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom takes place in the Dark Fantasy Realm of the decaying Eastern Provinces of the W_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;rstreich. Players take escaped criminal adventurers on unsavory missions through four distinct regions, each with their own monsters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; encounters. As the players explore the W_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;uuml;rstreich, danger levels rise continuously across the map. Players must complete their mission before the Hand of Doom descends on the board, unleashing evil magic on the land._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dungeon Degenerates is for 1-4 players co-op. Players can form parties or split up throughout the game at will; there is no obligation to stick together. Game play is 1-3 hours based on mission. Dungeon Degenerates has an epic RPG campaign feel in an open world sandbox board game, and you bring your experience _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; items from previous missions. There are multiple missions _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; objectives of varying difficulty with multiple ways to approach each mission. Dungeon Degenerates is set in a cohesive _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; fixed world with multiple distinct regions which feature unique encounters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; thematic monsters. Encounters allow multiple interaction choices; you do not have to fight everyone you see. Play features an open experience system allowing for character customization with new skills. You are always in danger - the town is not an artificial safe zone - combat is dangerous. There are various modes of travel - players cooperate to choose their route _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; pace, or split up _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; fend for themselves. Dungeon Degenerates features streamlined combat with tactical depth; each player rolls dice only once on their turn, using standard 6-sided dice only. There are over 100 monsters with unique abilities _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; artwork._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This sale includes:
- Dungeon Degenerates base game (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/210232)
- One resin miniature of the Hand of Doom
Both are still sealed.
My apologies for the high price, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what i paid for it (including shipping) :/. i will reduce the price by 5 Euros if the buyer picks up the package from me (in Geltendorf, Germany), rather than having it shipped.
Package ships from Germany and weighs approx. 3kg. Shipping prices:
Within Germany: 7 Euros
Other EU counties: 18 Euros
Non-EU countries: see:
https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/preise/preise-international.html
and use the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;up to 5kg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; column
Reason for selling: this is my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;backup copy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and i need to sell it to fund participation in the publisher_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s current Kickstarter ;).</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is my copy of:
 Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom. Also included is the expansion for the base game:
Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom Adventurer Expansion.
A few notes; my copy was originally missing the Bloodlust skill card. The publisher is in the process of sending me a new one. When I get it, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll forward it on to the buyer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed out a copy of the skill card in the meantime, so the skill can be used while playing.
I played my copy two times, and didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get very far. The game is complete (except for the soon-to-be-replaced Bloodlust skill card), and in excellent shape.
I will only ship to Canada and the US. 
Shipping to Canada will be $22, and to the US $28.</notes>

    <notes>Only played once, didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t dig the art and couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get into it.  Retails for $80 plus shipping, get it for nearly half off here.  Fits in a USPS Priority Medium box so shipping should only be like $13!</notes>

    <notes>PLEASE READ - This game is unplayed and unpunched. However, it has a corner ding and a hole was punched in the box bottom during shipping. It was opened to check the contents - there is no damage to any game content. Sold at a steep discount due to the damage. Great deal if it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bother you; this is only available from the manufacturer at $99 shipped.</notes>
