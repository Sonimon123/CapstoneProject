   <description>In City of Iron, 2-4 players compete to build up a small nation in a world of machines, magic, and money. Become the leader of one of four rival nations: the industrious humans, the toad engineers, the scholarly Cresarians, or the clever hogmen. Produce goods like machine parts and bottled demons to gain wealth, or research steam-age technology and recruit mercenaries to control the continent. If you want to establish new cities, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll build schooners or airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands. Your cities have limited capacity, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll have to decide what to keep and what to demolish when building advanced structures. The future of a nation is in your hands. Build unbreakable foundations for an empire or disappear into the dusty pages of history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Differences from the first edition:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The expert cards have some new iconography and have been rebalanced_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The expansion town card deck is gone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The auction for player order has been simplified_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The pay track for going later in the turn is gone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     A bonus coin replaced the pirates_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The timing of scoring rounds has been changed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Players now have different end-game scoring goals depending on their contract cards and regions, rather than everyone competing for the same set of end-game bonuses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Components are punched and carefully stored in quality ziploc bags. But game was never played. Everything is in untouched condition. 
Shipping:
All shipping is done via DHL. Shipping costs depend on size and weight of the parcel and destination.
Payment:
Within Germany I prefer the standard-bank-tranfer (IBAN _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; BIC). It is fast and causes no fees.
Outside Germany Paypal (friend transfer) and bank-transfer are possible.

Please feel free to ask (german/english).</notes>

    <notes>The game was never played, but the game items were punched and bagged for protection. All game items are present and accounted for.
The game also ships with Clockwork Fortress and Cave Market are a set of two promotional cards for the 1st edition of City of Iron.
These cards are added to the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;E_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; buildings; that is, they are available to build from the start of the game. 
The Cave Market adds one coin to your income for each different type of good you own. 
The Clockwork Fortress allows you to change the order of your citizen and military decks each time you refresh that deck.
These cards may also be used with the 2nd edition of City of Iron, where they are placed above the usual row of buildings and are not removed until they are purchased.
Buyer pays shipping cost. The game will ship via UPS-Ground</notes>

    <notes>In amazing condition! Was only played once and was sleeved in Dragon Shields prior to play (sleeves included). Photos available upon request.
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 5 pounds so figure an extra pound or so of packing material.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:

    <notes>Retail Edition. Box art has some splitting, but the box itself appears fine. Most components in very good to like new condition. Player deck cards do show some (minor in my opinion) whitening around the edges from use. I can take more pictures upon request if needed.
Game has only been played twice by us, but was acquired used. Buyer pays shipping via USPS or UPS with tracking, whichever is cheapest.</notes>

this is for the Essen-Auction trade we did. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind, please buy this item in the marketplace so that BGG can get their commission and we can give feedback.

In City of Iron, 2-4 players compete to build up a small nation in a world of machines, magic, and money. Become the leader of one of four rival nations: the industrious humans, the toad engineers, the scholarly Cresarians, or the clever hogmen. Produce goods like machine parts and bottled demons to gain wealth, or research steam-age technology and recruit mercenaries to control the continent. If you want to establish new cities, youâ€™ll build schooners or airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands. Your cities have limited capacity, so youâ€™ll have to decide what to keep and what to demolish when building advanced structures. The future of a nation is in your hands. Build unbreakable foundations for an empire or disappear into the dusty pages of history.
Differences from the first edition:
The expert cards have some new iconography and have been rebalanced
The expansion town card deck is gone
The auction for player order has been simplified
The pay track for going later in the turn is gone
A bonus coin replaced the pirates
The timing of scoring rounds has been changed
Players now have different end-game scoring goals depending on their contract cards and regions, rather than everyone competing for the same set of end-game bonuses</notes>
