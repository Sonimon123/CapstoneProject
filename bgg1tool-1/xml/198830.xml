   <description>Heroes of Land, Air _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Sea is a 4X-style board game with miniatures that tells the epic tale of orcs vs. humans, dwarves vs. elves, battling kingdoms, and the individuals who turn the tides of war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players control one of these classic factions, competing to expand their kingdom into new territory. Even the greatest kingdoms begin as small townships, therefore players begin with only a basic town hall, a couple of peons, and a single warrior. From there, players must explore the territory around them, build up their work force, fortify their army, and develop their kingdom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; all through careful action selection, exploitation, war, and resource management._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As players reach milestones in the development of their kingdom, they gain access to many advantages. Peons become warriors, warriors become powerful heroes, and town halls eventually become castles. Players gain access to water, and even air, vessels and creatures. Boarding these vessels and creatures with your units allows for faster travel across the vast game board and for positioning armies for powerful attacks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;War in Heroes of Land, Air _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Sea features a cost/reward system carefully detailed on tactics cards from which players must secretly choose. The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units participating in the war. It is here that players wage their wits and legacy in an attempt to exterminate one another. For as we all know, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;history is written by the victors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Heroes of Land, Air _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Sea also boasts two economic systems, one being the risky acquisition and careful management of the resources (food, ore and mana), while the other is a twist on worker placement that requires the leveraging of peons to construct buildings, peons that could otherwise be exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating! Finding this balance is crucial to victory!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Kickstarter Deluxe Edition with the painted figures add on!!! Yes the price is ridiculous and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect anyone to pay it. I really want this game but I am willing to give it up if someone else wants it that much more.
This comes with the base game (four factions), the expansion (four additional factions), Mercenaries Promo Pack 1 (four mercenaries), Mercenaries Promo Pack 2 (two additional mercenaries), the Nomad Mini Expansion (10 nomad minis), and the Siege Engine Mini Expansion (2 siege towers, 2 ballistae, 2 catapults). All heroes and mercenaries will be pre-painted with a money back guarantee  (exclusive to Kickstarter).

-Siege Weapons Expansion
Everything is still in shrink except for the Siege Weapons expansion, which has been punched and put together. I will put this expansion inside its own box so nothing gets damaged during shipping.
Ended up not wanting to keep the game after talking it over with my game group (I started to punch the siege expansion before the conversation), and no one seemed too interested. 
The box is not a standard size so shipping will most likely be a bit more as a heads up.
Feel free to ask any questions and I will try to respond as quickly as possible. Thanks for the consideration.</notes>

Mercenary pack 1
Mercenary pack 2

Base game is assembled, punched, and has been played three times. Two of the insert slots for elves have had the type of mini that goes there written on the plastic tray.
Includes all KS extras; if there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s anything I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t list let me know; it should be there.

Be warned that this is a huge pile of stuff and shipping will be expensive.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve put this as US only; while I am willing to ship overseas, the package is so large and heavy that doing so will be extremely expensive. Please inquire if you are interested, but it will be at LEAST $100 for overseas shipping.</notes>

Which includes mercenaries, nomads, the order and chaos expansion and siege engines.  Add on neoprene mat (large!) included as well.
Cards are sleeved.
This is Un-painted
Everything is punched and put together no glue used.  Played twice.  I threw out the plastic mini molded storage as that was a pain and took up too much space.  
Neoprene mat fits inside one of the boxes.

    <notes>For Kickstarter deluxe pledge with painted minis.  It has been opened punched assembled and organized.  The cardboard constructs have tape (not very noticeable) so they stay together.  They took a couple hours to assemble, so the work has been done.  The constructs are stored in a legendary card game box that fits in the order and chaos box.  There is a small tear of the art work in the corner of main game box.  And some slight tearing while building the constructs.  They were a bit difficult to build and I build mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.
The game is pretty heavy, 18lbs.    Shipping from Michigan.</notes>

This comes with the base game (four factions), the expansion (four additional factions), Mercenaries Promo Pack 1 (four mercenaries), Mercenaries Promo Pack 2 (two additional mercenaries), the Nomad Mini Expansion (10 nomad minis), and 2 sets of the Siege Engine Mini Expansion (4 siege towers, 4 ballistae, 4 catapults).
Everything is assembled but in excellent shape. I would not call it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because some of the cardboard pieces have some wear, but honestly I think it is going to happen no matter what when constructing them. You can watch the video by Gamelyn Games on constructing the cardboard pieces and you can see that sometimes the cardboard splits. So basically, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to say it is perfect, but I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say there are any glaring problems at all. All of the minis are accounted for and in excellent shape. Some of the thinner ones could use a dip in warm water and straightened up, but that is nothing out of the ordinary for a game with so many minis. Everything was put into the 2 big boxes and everything is in bags. The boxes are in perfect condition except for a slight tear in the artwork on the vertical edge of the bottom/inner box. You can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see it at all when the top is on. All cards are sleeved so they are in perfect condition. If you want photos or have any questions let me know.

Everything is assembled and in great condition - some of the buildings have been taped as suggested in the instructions to add durability (nothing is glued). This will save many hours of work and frustration.
Full disclosure - a kickstarter reprint is going on now, but I figured a buyer may want to get this game ASAP and not wait for the reprint. 
Shipping for both boxes and the mat will come to $28 (these are huge). It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very possible some of the pieces may need some slight repair, but I will pack the constructs well.</notes>

    <notes>THIS IS FOR THE PLAYMAT!

It was never used (never taken out of the box actually). This should save you approximately $18-20 vs ordering it direct from Gamelyn. Might as well get it to someone who will use it :)
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. It will fit into a USPS Medium Flat Rate box for approximately $14 within the US. If you would like to use a different service, I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) so you can estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 5.75 pounds so figure a pound or so of packing material.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:
