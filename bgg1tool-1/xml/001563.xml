   <description>Rise and Decline of the Third Reich is a realistic simulation of the grand strategic situation as it existed in Europe during WWII. It features 6 games in 1; a campaign game of 24 turns which runs from the invasion of Poland to Germany's final defeat or victory, an advanced game providing additional complexity, a multi-player version (in which even the Italian player can be the winner), and three 12-turn scenarios which allow you to play faster games. Third Reich is not for the faint of heart or the beginner simulation gamer. For 2 to 6 players. 560 counters which includes 1 blank one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rise and Decline of the Third Reich is a classic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;grand strategy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; wargame covering the European theater of WWII.  The game is huge in scope.  Players take on the roles of all of the major national powers and can simulate the entire war effort from 1939 until the end (often isn't until 1946).  This game is a favorite of many because of an excellent balance between politics and military might, and it gives players a chance to try things that did not happen historically to see if they might have worked better (e.g., Germany invading Spain).  This game is definitely not for the novice gamer. The rules are intricate, and there are many factors for players to deal with: resources, unit production, negotiation, and, of course, strategic warfare._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>100% Complete and UNPUNCHED. Never played and the contents are excellant.  No writing or marks of any kind.  I did notice a small bit of rust(?) on the staples of the rule book, otherwise it is clean and appears unread. Box shows some minor shelf wear but no splits or tears.  Dated 1974 so I assume it is a 1st edition.  Nice collectible copy.</notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50
European Postage: £10.00
Rest of World Postage: £20.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.

There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.

Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).

    <notes>This is Third Reich with the 4th Edition Rulebook. The shrinkwrap has been removed. The game box is in very, very good to excellent condition. Inside, the components are all as new. The rulebook is clear white - no fading. It is clean and crisp - never been read. The counters are all unpunched. The game aid cards are as new. The mapboard is in beautiful condition (the colours are vibrant with no fading whatsoever). The whole set of components are in truly excellent condition.
I pack very responsibly and make every effort to ensure the game reaches the buyer in the condition it leaves me. I buy a lot of games, so I appreciate the need for secure packing.

CONDITION: Excellent, lightly used condition - counters part-punched, verified complete and sorted _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; bagged. The box has slight shelf wear and creasing.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £11.00
Rest of World Postage: £21.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.

 I believe this is a 1st edition game of Third Reich. Map is older version, but still a mounted map board. Rule book has no edition printed on it, thus my belief it is first edition. Game is in well played condition. Map is in very good shape. Counters are punched and stored in envelopes provided by previous owner. Rule book has no major blemishes, but is used. French force pool card has small tear at top. Other force pool cards are in good condition. Box is worn. Three corners of lid are split and repaired by me with packaging tape. Box bottom is intact. This is an opportunity to own 1st edition of the granddaddy of WW2 grand strategic games.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and unpunched. The shrink wrap was removed about twenty five years ago. So, there are some minor signs of aging, but otherwise the game is in very good condition. Contains the third edition map board and the fourth edition rules. 
Included with this order as part of the price is a second incomplete copy of the game, and the issue of the General featuring Third Reich on its cover. The second game contains the map board (good condition), play-aid cards, and all but 17 counters. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not quite acceptable as a game by itself, but is a good source for spare parts. 
So, for the price of only $20 (plus shipping) you get a complete, unpunched copy of the game, an incomplete copy for spare parts, and the issue of the General featuring Third Reich.

    <notes>Game is complete and would be in like new condition if the counters had not been detached. They are however neatly organized in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original tray. The game rulebook is in perfect condition. 
The box has a little shelf wear and a small (nearly invisible) dent on the top side.
The game is otherwise in like new condition, showing NO WEAR at all. For all these years it has been stored in a closed cabinet in my home, under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. 
Lastly, see the picture for your reference. 
I will ship worldwide at buyer’s expenses. Shipping to the US is 18 Euros, to Europe 13 Euros and within Italy 9 Euros. I will check shipping rates to other locations on demand and revert.
Paypal or a bank draft preferred. Feel free to email me with questions!
(IMPORTANT NOTICE: I am away from home on most weekdays, so allow a couple of days for a reply to your queries). 
Thanks for looking! Riccardo

    <notes>Punched and bagged. I believe this is the first edition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s definitely not 3rd or later since box doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the 3rd edition printing.
All components are in great shape. Light to average wear on box lid.
A bit dated but among the all time best wargames.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $19 to Canada. $26 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>Version - Box says Third Edition, Rules are Fourth Edition. Part of Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s final direct sales clearance, where games were pieced back together from replacement parts and shipped unshrink wrapped.
Condition - Unpunched and unplayed. Box is structurally strong, but has significant scuffing on all sides - it was actually shipped that way by Avalon Hill. Marks on sides where box evidently was taped shut and then the tape peeled off. Contents are in like new condition, rulebook appears free of yellowing.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Very Good Condition Punched Copy. The game box shows noticeable signs of shelf-wear, there are some scuffs/general grubbiness from long term storage. The game box is in an acceptable state and fit for purpose.
Rules/Map Boards and Scenario Cards are very good, with a hint of grubbiness here and there (touch of staple rust to the rules). Counters are bagged/roughly sorted where appropriate - a hint of grubbiness here and there but perfectly legible and fit for play.
Please Note: The Fourth Edition, strictly speaking, applies only to the ruleset. The board is shared with Third Edition, and the counters shared with Second and Third Editions.</notes>

    <notes>Complete. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play it, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just trying to find a good home for it.  This one is in nice shape.
I highlighted in the rule book years ago for some reason.  Also includes the publication _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide to Third Reich_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (pub. 12/1988), a cool historical and strategic supplement published by AH. (No highlighting in this.) It did not come with the game.
Warning: Was kept in a smoky home for years, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not too bad. (I have found that if you leave the item in a place with air movement--like on top of an empty shelf or book case--the smoky smell will dissipate completely in a few months.)
Total price: $14.60.  I will ship via USPS flat-rate ($13.60) medium box.
[Sorry, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not trying to deceive on the price.  BGG won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t let me list shipping separately.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll make about $0.30 after PayPal charge.]</notes>

    <notes>Also comes with The Gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide to Third Reich.  The game itself is in goodcondition for its age.  The box is showing shelf wear.  The copy of the Gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide would be in perfect condition, but had been stored in the game box itself for which it is slightly too big, so it is curled.
Available for delivery using Canada Post from postal code L7M4A5.  Buyer pays shipping costs.
Also available for local pickup - downtown Toronto near union station weekdays at 5-6 pm, or in Burlington (time to be arranged).</notes>

    <notes>Complete first edition game.  Counters have been punched, but are stored in the original counter sheets with a photocopy of the intact counter sheets glued behind to show where each piece goes.  See pictures for what I am talking about.  Rulebook has pencil markings on the front, but otherwise is in good shape, showing normal wear for a game of this age.  The country cards have the SR rating written in the top corner for each, otherwise are in excellent shape.  Box corners are all intact, but show typical shelf wear for a game of this age.  Map is in excellent shape.  Please see pictures for condition of box and game.  We played this a lot back in the day!
Will ship via USPS, FedEx or UPS, your choice.  Shipping costs will be actual costs.  I am located in the Dallas, Texas area.</notes>
