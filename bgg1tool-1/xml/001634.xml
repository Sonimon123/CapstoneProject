   <description>Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the Main Rulebook:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Warhammer Quest Contents -_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Orc Warrior models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Orc Archer models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Goblin Spearmen models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Night Goblin Archer models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Skaven models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    3 Minotaur models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Giant Spider models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Giant Bat models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Giant Rat models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    12 Snotling models_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    10 Dungeon Doorways_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    32 Page Rule Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    16 Page Adventure Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    192 Page Role-play Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 How to Play sheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    19 Event Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    23 Dungeon Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    30 Treasure Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    17 Blank Event Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    15 Spell Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 Warrior Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 Battle-level Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 Equipment Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 Warrior Counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Dungeon Rooms_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    5 Objective Rooms_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    7 Corridors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 Steps_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    3 T-junctions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 Corner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 Portcullis Marker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 Cave-in Marker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    3 Pit of Despair Markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Webbed Counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    15 Power Tokens_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    10 Luck Counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    18 Scenery Markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Large Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 12 Small Dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is complete.  Materials are in good condition.  Some of the miniatures were painted by the previous owner.  (Better than I could do.)  The game has been played and shows minor wear.  The box is solid, but shows self wear.  I am tossing in Issue #3 of Deathblow, a short-lived magazine devoted to Warhammer Quest.
Sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use a digital camera, I promise this is a good copy of the game.</notes>

    <notes>Notes: This copy of Warhammer Quest has a number of unique items, so please read carefully. I will be happy to supply further details and pictures to anyone interested.
General:
In general, the game is in good condition overall and is definitely playable. The only thing really missing are the 12 Skaven (ratmen) models, which had been replaced by 7+ unpunched Skaven models from Mordheim. 
Box: Game was being stored in a very nice wine crate, so it has no box. Wine crate can be shipped to the buyer or left behind as the buyer prefers. (Note that the shipping charges will probably go up $15-20 if the wine crate is sent.)
Rules/Cards:
Rules: All 3 books present. Main book shows some wear. Introduction sheet present.
Cards: All present and show little wear and no damage.
Blank cards: Have been used, only 6 remain.
Warrior Cards: All present.
Scenery:
Doors: All present, show no damage.
Tiles: show minor wear, all present.
Webbed/Power/Luck tokens: All present, show no wear.
18 Scenery markers: Missing 1 marker.
Dice: All present. (Using replacement d6s for large d6s, small d6s are all original.)
Miniatures:
Heroes: All present. All are painted with varying amounts of skill.
Orc Warriors: All present, well painted.
Orc Archers: 2 partially painted (green skin), others unpainted.
Goblin Spearmen: 2 broken, all partially painted (skin and clothes)
Goblin Archers: Complete, unpainted.
Minotaur models, partially painted. (One only primered, one badly painted.)
Spiders: Complete, unbroken, all well painted.
Bats: Complete, unbroken, unpainted.
Snotlings: Complete, unbroken, unpainted.
Skaven: Missing, have put in at least 7 unremoved from sprues Skaven models from Mordheim. These allow for customization and include many bits. 
Bonus: to make up for the lack of skaven, other painted goblin minis are included, such as fanatics, wolf riders and others.
Also available, for $13 apiece: Chaos Warrior, Warrior Priest, Pit Fighter. All are complete and show good painting jobs on the figure. To be clear - these are not included in the base price, they must be purchased separately. (Shipping will be combined with the main game if interested.)</notes>

    <notes>I have a very good copy of this game.  the only thing different is that I three hole punched all of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s documentation in order to put them all in a binder, with the exception of the Role Play book which is untouched. The box top is slightly bowed in, but that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just because the packaging on this game wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t that great to begin with. Otherwise, the game is in great shape and COMPLETE. 
 I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather let my friends at BBG score this game instead of putting it on E-bay!  This is a very hard game to find complete.  now is your chance to own a classic. I can provide pictures if desired.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete set.  There is some wear on the game in general and board tiles, but it is otherwise in nice shape.
I also have a complete, mint _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; copy and a complete _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; copy for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in those, let me know (since I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t figure out how to list multiple copies like that).
I have yet another for sale that is only in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.  The barbarian in that set has a broken sword, and there is much more wear on the game.

    <notes>PLEASE NOTE: This is not just the base game.  This is a collection that includes the base game and many expansions/extras.  Price is somewhat negotiable.  I expect shipping to be substantial, since we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re talking about over 10 pounds of stuff.
I loved this game when I got it, and bought nearly everything that came out for it.  This is a cool game with a bunch of extras that has been out of print for probably more than 10 years.  You may never see a package quite like this again.
The condition is definitely used, but the wear is not severe.  It’s no collector’s piece, but it’s in nice shape (other than the boxes).  I’m 99% sure everything is here, and 100% sure that everything important is here.  The one exception is the original boxes for the expansion stuff.  I didn’t think I’d ever want to let it go, so I didn’t keep all of the packaging, preferring to keep it compact.  I could see how some might think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pushing things to call the condition _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I think it would be a shame not to give people an opportunity to acquire and play this amazing game. 
Expansion packs:
Lair of the Orc Lord
Catacombs of Terror
Character Packs:
Imperial Noble (mini is well-painted)
Pit Fighter (primed and partially painted)
Elf Ranger (primed and partially painted)
Warrior Priest (primed but unpainted)
Witch Hunter
Brettonian Questing Knight
Wardancer
6 extra Dungeon Doorways (unpainted)
3 extra Bats (1 painted)
4 extra Snotlings (1 painted)
4 extra Spiders
1 extra Rat
One Goblin Spearman has a broken spear, seven shields are not attached to minis, and four seem to be missing altogether.
Most of the minis that come with the base set are painted.  Several different people did the painting, but most of the paint jobs are reasonably good.
Extra pack of Blank Event Cards (opened, but not used)
I have about three times the number of Treasure Cards (not counting the extras from the expansion sets) as are supposed to come with the base game.  I don’t quite remember, but I think there must have been a couple of treasure decks sold separately that I bought.
I also have 4 Event Cards that look as though they might have come from an issue of White Dwarf magazine.
Extra (low-grade) minis from another GW game (co-produced with Milton Bradley):
10 Beastmen
5 Chaos Warriors
4 Chaos Archers
(all unpainted)
p.s. At the moment, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m still looking for the Liche King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s throne from Catacombs of Terror.  I know it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s around somewhere, so it should just be a matter of time.  If for some reason I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find it and you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to wait, we can negotiate a lower price.</notes>

    <notes>Warhammer Quest is complete with an additional 20 treasure cards (for a total of 50 - the base game comes with 30).
The 4 hero figures have been painted.
Game is in surprisingly good shape considering it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age.  Box shows some shelf wear, but all the pieces are in great shape.

    <notes>Box has crisp colors, although one split box corner and a tear in the box top from too much dishing assocated with other boxes on top.  Not too large, but present.
Game is missing 1 snotling, missing the Barbarian hero counter, and 1 bat is broken.  There are 35 small figure bases and I think there should be 36.  3 of the heroes are partially painted and 1 Goblin is partially painted as well.  Not particularly well done.
The game is missing the original rule book (32 pages) and Roleplay book (192 pages) but includes a copy of these two booklets I located on a Warhammer Quest resource cite.  The full color, original Adventure Book is present.
Shipping is $13 to Eastern and Central time zone regions and $16 to Mountain and Pacific.  The box is quite large and unwieldy so shipping outside the U.S. will be high but I can figure it for interested parties.
Pictures are available upon request.

    <notes>Like new: played only part of one game, once. I think a few sculpts (a rat and orc, maybe?) may be missing or damaged, but the game came that way from the manufacturer -- we bought and have owned the game continuously.
Includes Treasure Packs 1 (opened, and either unplayed or played partially once), 2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 3 (in shrink). Also, 2 unopened packs of blank event cards although only 1 of these has the label card listing contents (17 Monster, 4 Event).

    <notes>This copy is not perfect, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s absolutely playable. 
It is missing the Wizard counter (not mini) and all dice. A few pieces are broken: several bats (snapped off the stick), 2 goblin archers (tops of bows snapped), 1 goblin spearman (spearhead), 1 skaven (sword) and the Elf character (sword). 
All broken pieces are included so a simple glue job will most likely make them as good as new. A lot of the minis were painted/primed upon arrival but I have stripped most of it. Includes several printouts of supplemental material such as extra character sheets and cards, even a couple character expansion scans as well.
All rulebooks, tiles, and cards are in very good shape...surprisingly good shape. The rules are pristine and the tiles show only tiniest bit of wear to some edges. One treasure card is a bit bent in the corner, otherwise all are in excellent shape.
Please message me for pictures (may take a couple days) or with any questions. I am putting this up for what I paid for it on eBay. I am making NO profit, so grab it while it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hot.

    <notes>This game is 99% complete with all components except one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;power_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; token*. Condition is as follows:
Box: Shelf wear, two corners fixed with clear tape, but still solid and in good nick considering the age.
Books: All in clean, unmarked and very nice condition. Still includes an ancient Games Workshop catalogue!
Boards: Generally very good condition, one hallway has a small (4mm or so) mark, some tiles have light surface wear, but no tearing or noticeable damage. Long hallway boards are curved due to age, but the plastic doorways support the ends and this does not affect play.
Tokens and tiles: All in very nice, clean condition. *The missing Power Token has minimal impact on the game; Your wizard can start with a maximum of six tokens and the game is supposed to have fifteen tokens in total, believe me, unless you level that wizard up pretty high, you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use them.
Miniatures: All are unpainted and complete, damaged ones have been replaced with identical pieces from another copy of the game, so all are in excellent condition.
Cards: Generally very good indeed, spell cards and character cards are lightly worn, but still very bright and clear, no appreciable damage.
Dice: All present, including the tiny, red dice used to mark wounds.
Character sheets: 13 of the original paper sheets left, can easily be photocopied.
Overall this game is in great shape, the box being the most worn part. It has been well looked after and is totally complete. Please ask any questions BEFORE purchase, especially if you are outside the UK. Pictures are available on request. 
Shipping to the UK is included in the cost of the game, outside the UK I will require you to pay towards the postage (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bloody heavy game at approx. 2.7 kilos!).
Thanks for looking, I really want this to go to a good home and get played! </notes>

Box has the usual scuffmarks wear, with one corner of the lid torn.
However, the game is 100% complete (all components checked and accounted for) with all the figures undamaged and STILL IN THE ORIGINAL SPRUES.
Please be aware:
This box has been stored in a damp environment, meaning that all cardboard and paper pieces have a musty smell. No visible mildew markings though; all components are looking good. Rulebook has very minor damage on the side.
The miniatures do not suffer from the issues mentioned.
So, if you are looking for all the undamaged Warhammer Quest figures still in sprues, and have a method to get rid of the musty smell in the other components (or don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them), then look no further :)

    <notes>Some minor damage to the box.
I think the Barbarian and Elf suffered some damage in the past but have been expertly repaired. Originally this copy was missing all the dungeon tiles, but the previous owner laser-copied the tiles from another copy he had and stuck them on card, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s complete.
Someone has started painting the Elf, and some of the doorways have been undercoated and/or given nice dry-brush paint jobs by the look of it. The quickstart rules are photocopied rather than original too.
Everything else is present and correct.
Also includes copies of the following White Dwarf articles, and all the included tiles/cards etc. from them made up.
WD 185: Mission Impossible
WD 186: Flames of Khazla

    <notes>Complete except for 2 power counters. All rooms, cards, miniatures and other counters are included, all in very good condition although some of the miniatures are painted. 1 Hero has a broken off sword, but the hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are nicely painted. Nothing else is broken. Doors unpainted, cards look like new, so do the rooms and all of the medium sized minis (skaven, orcs, goblins). The small minis (rats, spiders, snotlings and 5 out of 12 bats) are painted, so are the 3 large minis (minotaurs)
Will add pictures later, available upon request if interested.</notes>

    <notes>Nearly unplayed. I think I started to set up the intro rules scenario (uses a room and three figures) so one score sheet is written.
Miniatures unglued and unpainted.
Box is looking a little worn around the corners but in very good shape for a GW box of this era.
Bonus:
Trollslayer character card/ booklet/ item cards - no mini or box.
Bonus objective room Quirrik_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s laboratory and tokens but not rules (from white dwarf 195)
Does not have the original dice in the box - it came with 12 small and 6 large dice. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include replacements.

    <notes>the game was bought used and played once. it is 100% complete (NONE of the miniatures are painted) and also includes some additional treasure cards which seem to originate from a white dwarf magazine promotion (they have small marks on the sides due to their packaging withing the magazine).
the box has a visible dent on the top left corner.
the game was stored in closet, in a non-smoking a no-pets household (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m boring, yes.).
international buyers are welcome but consider the fact that shipping might be a little pricey, depending on your location. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m fine with whatever shipping method you prefer (insured, etc.) as long as you cover the cost.
picture of the game can be sent to you on request.
I also have a 100% complete, NON-painted copy of the Warhammer Quest addon _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Lair of the Orc Lord_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ready to be sold.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Warhammer Quest is 100% complete. Almost everything is in amazing condition, except for one or two Goblin spears that are broken (included). The binding on the Roleplay Book is also somewhat loose (though not due to overuse - just due to age). Tiles are nice and glossy, cards are virtually untouched. Everything is bagged and sorted. Even includes the pad of character record sheets!
The box has some shelf wear, and clear tape on one or two corners. Otherwise in very nice shape. Shipping will be actual cost. Pictures available on request.
I also have 5 of the hero expansions: Wardancer, Elf Ranger, Pit Fighter, Warrior Priest, and Chaos Warrior. See those respective pages for details.</notes>

    <notes>This is a much loved, but well played copy of GW_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s WHQ. Many of the miniatures are missing or in poor condition, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included them anyway because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have no use for them once this is sold. 
This lot includes all the cards/tokens/tiles for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Lair of the orc Warlord_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; expansion, as well as many White Dwarf mini expansions (so expect cut out and stick together cards or push out tiles etc).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve tried to photograph as much of the contents as possible, but can take further pictures if people need to see anything closer up.
The rule books are in fairly good condition, but the roleplaying book (my favourite part of the game) is rather well used, and in need of some love/repair.</notes>

    <notes>This offer is for the base game and the following three expansion packs: Elf Ranger, Warrior Priest and Imperial Noble.
Most components are in excellent condition. The box lid itself shows some wear, but is perfectly functional.
All the models are unpainted and the game has only been played a couple of times.
Going through all the models I noticed, that a few of the models are damaged as follows:
2 of the 6 Goblin Spearmen have their spears broken (one of the spears is still around and can be glued, the other one is missing but can be easily replaced
1 of the 6 Night Goblin Archers has its bow broken off above the hand. This is a bit more tricky to repair, but sure can be done (or the model can be replaced, plastic goblin archers can be bought of ebay for cheap)
1 of the 12 Giant Bats has a flight stand that is close to breaking off. This again can easily be replaced should it actually break
1 of the 12 Snotlings misses a part of his arm. This is hard to repair, but you could either replace it or just leave it (11 Snotlings will be enough for playing the game)
All the other components are in excellent condition and complete.
All the cards and tokens come sorted in zip lock bags, so that the content of the box is neat and tidy.
I got it a few years ago and had hoped that this could be something for my son. But it has turned out that he likes spaceships more than dwarfs and elves and so we now play Firestorm Armada and we do not ave the time for another miniatures game.
And instead of keeping the game and never playing it, I think it is much better to give it to someone who will really use it.
Based on the condition of the game and the prices of the three included expansions (30-50 EUR each), this is a great deal for this grail game.
Oh, and we are an animal free and non-smoking household.</notes>

    <notes>Complete.
Have a look in my gallery for photos. Some minis are base coated and two painted. Note one ork bow and a skaven sword are broken.
The cards and board are in great condition, with a brilliant shine on the board pieces.
The box is good for its age with a bit of wear. It was not the thickest cardboard.
Any questions do ask.</notes>
