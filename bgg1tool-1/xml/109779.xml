   <description>Garden Dice is a family strategy game that combines dice rolling, tile laying, and set collection. The game board depicts a garden as a 6x6 grid in which seed and vegetable tiles are placed using dice rolls as coordinates. Players take turns using the dice to plant, water, and harvest five different types of vegetables with differing point values, from the lowly squash to the mighty eggplant._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game's chaining mechanism allows players to water or harvest multiple tiles using a single action, enabling players to build upon each others' chains. Players can also use bird and rabbit tiles to eat other players' seed and veggie tiles, but not without paying a small penalty. Two other special tiles _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the sundial and the scarecrow _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; allow players to modify dice rolls or protect their own tiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Gnome expansion included in Garden Dice can be added to the base game to give players the ability to adjust the dice rolls for purchasing, watering, and harvesting their vegetables, leading to a more strategic experience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bonuses increase the values of tiles as they are harvested, and additional points are awarded at the end of the game for collecting sets. The player with the most points when the last tile is taken wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Meridae Games (MER001)
Garden Dice is a strategic dice rolling and tile laying board game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up. The board depicts a garden as a 6 x 6 grid where players place their vegetable tiles using dice rolls as coordinates. Dice are also used to water and harvest the tiles. Special tiles give players additional options and create new game dynamics. At the end of the game, bonus points are awarded for collecting sets of tiles, and the player with the most points after all tiles have been played is the winner. Garden Dice uses simple rules but delivers an unexpected element of strategy. Clever dice usage and tile placement are rewarded and the game features opportunities for symbiotic play. Even seasoned gamers will find something new in Garden Dice. </notes>

    <notes>Meridae Games (MER001)
Garden Dice is a strategic dice rolling and tile laying board game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up. The board depicts a garden as a 6 x 6 grid where players place their vegetable tiles using dice rolls as coordinates. Dice are also used to water and harvest the tiles. Special tiles give players additional options and create new game dynamics. At the end of the game, bonus points are awarded for collecting sets of tiles, and the player with the most points after all tiles have been played is the winner. Garden Dice uses simple rules but delivers an unexpected element of strategy. Clever dice usage and tile placement are rewarded and the game features opportunities for symbiotic play. Even seasoned gamers will find something new in Garden Dice.</notes>

    <notes>Played once. Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags. I will work with you to ship the most cost efficient way or however you prefer. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. If the item is a small card game the shipping will be USPS First Class and will be around $5 total with shipping materials.</notes>
