   <description>In Red Dragon Inn, you and your friends are a party of heroic, fantasy adventurers. You've raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you're back, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The four characters are Deirdre the Priestess, Fiona the Volatile, Gerki the Sneak, and Zot the Wizard._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Slugfest Games (SFG 004)
The Adventure’s over, but the party’s just getting started!
You and your adventuring companions have spent all day slogging through the Dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn.
Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t forget to keep an eye on your Gold. If you run out, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh... and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you... after they loot your body for Gold of course!
The last conscious adventurer with Gold wins the game!
Take on the role of one of these heroic fantasy adventurers - Dierdre, Fiona, Gerki, or Zot - and enjoy an evening at the Red Dragon Inn!
Dierdre the Priestess
Dierdre uses the power of the Goddess to protect and heal her friends and to smite the wicked creatures of the deep dungeons. She_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also smite anyone who treats her like a bimbo; even though she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not above working her good looks get her way.
Fiona the Volatile
This brash warrior maiden is quick with a sword... or axe, or dagger, or any other sharp or pointy thing she can get her hands on.
Gerki the Sneak
Gerki_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a shifty halfling whose pockets are always full of Gold. A master of poisons, mechanisms, and stabbing people in the back, Gerki has saved the lives of his friends many, many times. Of course, if he wasn’t so darn useful they most likely would have killed him by now!
Zot the Wizard
Zot might have had a cushy job teaching magic theory at the Wizards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; College, had he not been saddled with Pooky, a psychotic, binge drinking bunny rabbit, as his familiar.</notes>

The Adventure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s over, but the party_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just getting started! You and your adventuring companions have spent all day slogging through the Dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn. Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t forget to keep an eye on your Gold. If you run out, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh... and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you... after they loot your body for Gold of course! The last conscious adventurer with Gold wins the game! Take on the role of one of these heroic fantasy adventurers - Dierdre,Fiona, Gerki, or Zot - and enjoy an evening at the Red Dragon Inn! Dierdre the Priestess uses the power of the Goddess to protect and heal her friends and to smite the wicked creatures of the deep dungeons. She_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also smite anyone who treats her like a bimbo even though she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not above working her good looks get her way. Fiona the Volatile is a brash warrior maiden is quick with a sword... or axe, or dagger, or any other sharp or pointy thing she can get her hands on. Gerki the Sneak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a shifty halfling whose pockets are always full of Gold. A master of poisons, mechanisms, and stabbing people in the back, Gerki has saved the lives of his friends many, many times. Of course, if he wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t so darn useful they most likely would have killed him by now! Zot the Wizard might have had a cushy job teaching magic theory at the Wizards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; College, had he not been saddled with Pooky, a psychotic, binge drinking bunny rabbit, as his familiar.</notes>

The Adventure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s over, but the party_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just getting started! You and your adventuring companions have spent all day slogging through the Dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn. Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t forget to keep an eye on your Gold. If you run out, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh... and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you... after they loot your body for Gold of course! The last conscious adventurer with Gold wins the game! Take on the role of one of these heroic fantasy adventurers - Dierdre,Fiona, Gerki, or Zot - and enjoy an evening at the Red Dragon Inn! Dierdre the Priestess uses the power of the Goddess to protect and heal her friends and to smite the wicked creatures of the deep dungeons. She_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also smite anyone who treats her like a bimbo even though she_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not above working her good looks get her way. Fiona the Volatile is a brash warrior maiden is quick with a sword... or axe, or dagger, or any other sharp or pointy thing she can get her hands on. Gerki the Sneak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a shifty halfling whose pockets are always full of Gold. A master of poisons, mechanisms, and stabbing people in the back, Gerki has saved the lives of his friends many, many times.

You and your adventuring companions have spent all day slogging through the Dungeon, killing monsters and taking their stuff. Now you’re back in town, healed up, cleaned up, and ready to party at the Red Dragon Inn.
Drink, gamble, and roughhouse with your friends. But don’t forget to keep an eye on your Gold. If you run out, you’ll have to spend the night in the stables. Oh… and try not to get too beaten up or too drunk. If you black out, your friends will continue the party without you… after they loot your body for Gold of course!
The last conscious adventurer with Gold wins the game!
Take on the role of one of these heroic fantasy adventurers – Deirdre, Fiona, Gerki, or Zot – and enjoy an evening at the Red Dragon Inn! 
 
Deirdre the Priestess
Deirdre uses the power of the Goddess to protect and heal her friends and to smite the wicked creatures of the deep dungeons. She’ll also smite anyone who treats her like a bimbo, even though she’s not above working her good looks get her way.
The Good: The Goddess keeps Deirdre protected from harm.
The Bad: The Goddess’s protection does not help against alcohol. Deirdre is a cheap date.
Fiona the Volatile
This brash warrior maiden is quick with a sword… or axe, or dagger, or any other sharp or pointy thing she can get her hands on.
The Good: She’s more than capable of dishing out and taking serious physical abuse, and her formidable constitution allows her to drink a lot!
The Bad: For all her strengths, she’s not very good at keeping track of her Gold.
Gerki the Sneak
Gerki’s a shifty halfling whose pockets are always full of Gold. A master of poisons, mechanisms, and stabbing people in the back, Gerki has saved the lives of his friends many, many times. Of course, if he wasn’t so darn useful they most likely would have killed him by now!
The Good: Gerki is so good at gambling that some people suspect that he might be cheating.
The Bad: Yeah, he’s cheating.
 
Zot the Wizard
Zot might have had a cushy job teaching magic theory at the Wizards’ College, had he not been saddled with Pooky, a psychotic, binge drinking bunny rabbit, as his familiar.
The Good: Zot is good at card tricks, and, hence, is good at gambling. His mastery of many magical spells keeps him well protected, whether he’s roughhousing, drinking, or gambling.
The Bad: That rabbit is insane. Seriously.
You Get:
4 unique 40 card player decks
One 30 card Drink deck
4 Player Templates
4 Fortitude markers
4 Alcohol Content markers
50 Gold Coin tokens

    <notes>Description: Red Dragon Inn mint/sealed (shrink wrap is torn on lower right rear) [not sure which version, but was purchased recently so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess English 8th... if this is important please let me know how to tell the difference based on the exterior box]
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>
