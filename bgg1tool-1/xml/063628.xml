Shipping: Shipping rates will be determined upon sale or request. Insurance is optional but highly recommended for higher priced items. The shipping costs are NOT inflated. You pay exactly what I am charged for shipping, along with material costs. I ship through FedEx or USPS, whichever is cheaper. Normal shipping costs run from $8.00 - $11.00. If you have a commercial address that I can send to, your shipping costs will be even less!
Payment: I accept PayPal, money orders, personal and cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks. Personal checks will be accepted but I will wait until the check has cleared before sending the item. 
Return Policy: I want you to be completely satisfied with your item. Because of this, I will accept return of any item for a refund of the purchase price within 30 days of the sale. The item must be in the same condition that it was sent. I cannot refund the shipping cost.

    <notes>Minion Games (MNIMHP100)
A power struggle at the beginning of an atomic age. A revolutionary new technology. Who will use it to build the deadliest arsenal and become the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dominant superpower? The Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nuke_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities. The game features worker placement with a twist; There are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out). An espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building, representing technology theft and sabotage. </notes>

    <notes>Minion Games (MNIMHP100)
A power struggle at the beginning of an atomic age. A revolutionary new technology. Who will use it to build the deadliest arsenal and become the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dominant superpower? The Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nuke_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities. The game features worker placement with a twist; There are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out). An espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building, representing technology theft and sabotage. </notes>

    <notes>Minion Games (MNIMHP100)
A power struggle at the beginning of an atomic age. A revolutionary new technology. Who will use it to build the deadliest arsenal and become the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dominant superpower? The Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nuke_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities. The game features worker placement with a twist; There are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out). An espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building, representing technology theft and sabotage.

    <notes>Very good game, but just doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hit my table anymore.  Only played a handful of games but put my fiancee off by ganging up on her with a friend when she was winning and bombing the heck out of her...she still won.
Game is in very good condition with all parts present.  Second class UK signed-for postage is included in the price.  If you are from elsewhere then I will calculate the postage charge.

    <notes>This game has been played but is in excellent condition. It includes the Nations expansion for an extra dimension to gameplay. As per the picture this is the second edition which has brown markers for the yellow player to avoid colour blindness issues and confusion with the yellow yellow cake pieces. I have also included very good laminated player aid cards and a second print out of the rules and unofficial solo rules which create a great solo game.
Postage will be £3.50 via myhermes tracked to mainlaid UK only.</notes>

Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.

Shipping costs extra. Shipping from Maryland (21146).  Will ship worldwide but note that it will be expensive (better to have someone receive it for you in the U.S.)
Shipping costs can be combined if you purchase other items that I am selling.
PayPal for payment.  USPS for shipment.
If you are outside the U.S., please add 2 percent of the total (to include shipping costs) to cover the extra PayPal fees.</notes>
