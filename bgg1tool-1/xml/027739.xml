   <description>Hearts and Minds: Vietnam 1965-1975 is a card-driven game covering the American buildup of troops and arms in Southeast Asia as to our decision to begin troop withdrawal: 1965-1975. The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement). Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanisms actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, tokens to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies.

    <notes>Worthington Games (WOG 043)
Vietnam is a card-driven game covering the American buildup of troops and arms in Southeast Asia as to our decision to begin troop withdrawal: 1965-1975. The game is quick (3-6 hours) and clean (map using area movement) Hearts and Minds uses most major events of the period, including proposed events such as the Macnamara Line which was never actually built. Although nominally a combat game, the mechanics actually revolve around both sides occupying South Vietnamese provinces for propaganda purposes. The heart of the game is political influence. There is little doubt that the Allied player will eventually withdraw his American boys from the quagmire, but the question is, how quickly and in what numbers?
Hearts and Minds contains 80 cards, tokens to represent the American army, the ARVN army, the NVA army, VC units of varying hidden strength, the Cambodian army, the Laotian army and a small contingent of international allies. Turn tokens, withdrawal tokens, reduced movement tokens as well CAS (Close Air Support), communist Air Suppression and artillery is also included. More rules cover Air Cavalry, naval support, Riverine interdiction, and bombers. Untried troops are a liability in the game, Veteran troops are a necessity. Ultimately, the Communist player must deal the American such a crushing public relations disaster that he will abandon his Southeast Asian allies before the momentum of those allies stalemates the irreversible infiltration of South Vietnam.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m no expert on this game so Geekmail me if you have specific questions, but here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what you get (everything in great shape, no writing on, or damage to, any components): 
First edition box 
Punched counters. Sorted and bagged. Counters seem to have been updated to 2nd edition as vehicle and artillery counters have stickers on them. These stickers have been nicely printed and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hard to tell they are there at all.
Standard map and 1st edition rules
A _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Playbook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and two charts and tables cards
What I believe are the 2nd edition rules. Much longer than first edition. Seem to be photocopies and bound with those plastic grab binders
1st edition cards. All in plastic sleeves
Color printouts of all the 2nd edition cards. These are on normal printer paper and uncut. The dozen or so cards I checked had no text changes but I suppose some have been errated or updated between editions.
An excellent and verified complete copy if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to play this game.</notes>
