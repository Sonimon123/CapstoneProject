 STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions’ leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace… but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.
You have fought hard and established your Kingdom, but peace never lasts.
Your scouts report that hordes of treacherous monsters are approaching the outskirts of your Capital City. If your Capital City falls you will lose everything, along with your Kingdom.
Gather your friends and defend the onslaught in this exciting and unpredictable cooperative micro-game!
In Tiny Epic Defenders, players must select their class and work together to defend the foreboding horde and slay the Epic Foe.
Will you take on the role of the Barbarian, the Sorcerer, the Cleric or the Warrior? Each class has a unique player power that you will need to use.
In this fast-paced game, players will scramble between various regions outside their Capital City fighting off enemy hordes! Each region will offers unique properties that players must calculate into their strategy
If your group is fortunate enough to defeat the wave of monsters, you may live long enough to face the Epic Foe! Which Epic foe will it be? Will you be prepared!?
Does your group have what it takes to survive? Will you have the synergy to be crowned the Tiny Epic Defenders!?</notes>

 STORY: After the Great War (Tiny Epic Kingdoms), many of the factions, shattered and defeated, looked for something to cling to. One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions’ leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace… but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.
You have fought hard and established your Kingdom, but peace never lasts.
Your scouts report that hordes of treacherous monsters are approaching the outskirts of your Capital City. If your Capital City falls you will lose everything, along with your Kingdom.
Gather your friends and defend the onslaught in this exciting and unpredictable cooperative micro-game!
In Tiny Epic Defenders, players must select their class and work together to defend the foreboding horde and slay the Epic Foe.
Will you take on the role of the Barbarian, the Sorcerer, the Cleric or the Warrior? Each class has a unique player power that you will need to use.
In this fast-paced game, players will scramble between various regions outside their Capital City fighting off enemy hordes! Each region will offers unique properties that players must calculate into their strategy
If your group is fortunate enough to defeat the wave of monsters, you may live long enough to face the Epic Foe! Which Epic foe will it be? Will you be prepared!?
Does your group have what it takes to survive? Will you have the synergy to be crowned the Tiny Epic Defenders!?</notes>

    <notes>Selling an unopened, 100% dead stock copy of tiny epic defenders. Game is the kickstarter deluxe edition. Along with the game you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get a character meeple for both the villains and the heroes. Both are very nice and add a special element to the game. I have another copy that I play and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need the extra. Great game and great price to get with everything included. Buyer pays shipping.  Prefer to stay domestic in the US. Will be packaged super securely and in a way Id want my game to arrive.  Will ship day after payment is received, unless on a weekend and will always be the monday after. Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - Tiny Epic Defenders - has been unwrapped, opened, and only played once. Basically, this means that the condition of the game is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
! - The Kickstarter mini-expansion (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/162225/tiny-epic-defenders-kickstarter-mini-expansion) is included! I bought it separately at the same time I purchased the base game. The deluxe version wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t available at that time yet.
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/chidentity ...</notes>
