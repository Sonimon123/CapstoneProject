   <description>Stalingrad Pocket 2nd Edition - The Wehrmacht's Greatest Disaster, covers the Soviet counteroffensive and the German operations to hold the pincers apart and (if that fails) to relieve the Stalingrad pocket. Soviet play requires the use of a ponderous and fragile weapon of great size (the Red Army of 1942). German play requires sabre-like use of mobile reserves in hit and run attacks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;History: (from the back of the box:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The German Wehrmacht stands at the pinnacle of  its last season of blitzkrieg. Embattled German troops hold most of the city of Stalingrad _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;shy; but the flanks are covered with less dependable Axis allied units. Opposing these flanks are the shock troops of the 1942 Soviet winter counteroffensive. They are poised to encircle Stalingrad and turn the tide of the war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Game: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2nd Edition SP: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is the second edition of Stalingrad Pocket, winner of the 1992 CSR Award for Best WW2 Game. It includes a reworked map and Order of Battle (utilizing Enemy at the Gates, the 1994 CSR Best WW2 Game award winner).

    <notes>Brand New, still in shrink wrap. 
Shipping in the U.S. is $10 for the first game, but if you buy more than one game, then each additional adds only $1 to the combined shipping. 
For international buys, ask and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find out how much the shipping would be. 
If you live in the L.A. area, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re welcome to come by my house and pick the games up for no shipping charge.</notes>

    <notes>Stalingrad pocket - 2nd edition
Game has been set up a number of times. Game is 100% complete, not missing a single counter (as with my other listing, Borodino). I am obsessed about having all counters complete at all times.
Counters are carefully sorted into a GMT Games counter tray (not part of the original game, but part of this listing).
According to policy I must rate condition as very good. In reality I would say it is like new. The box is in near pristine condition. No damage to the counters that I am aware of (as with my other listing, Borodino).
Shipping and handling will be actual costs (post office receipt can be provided by me if needed).</notes>

    <notes>Unpunched.  Looks new minus the shrink.  Contents verified complete and in like new condition.  Stalingrad SCS style.  Awesome game from an awesome series although your counter density around Stalingrad will get heavy.  Get your tweezers out!!!  Box is square and straight with no dings or doinks.  Couple of small corner creases on the back.  Very little box wear to be seen.  Worldwide shipping and will be packed well.  All forms of negotiable instruments considered.  Combine ship with multiple purchases.</notes>

    <notes>Game in excellent condition with unpunched counters and slightly scuffed box used by The Gamers at this point in time. Will be happy to respond to any questions or supply additional photos. Happy to combine shipping and handling with other games I am selling. Shipping and handling will be a flat $15.00 for this game on its own.</notes>
