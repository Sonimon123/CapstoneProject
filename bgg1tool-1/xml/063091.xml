   <description>Space Hulk is a game of tactical combat between Imperial Space Marines and alien creatures known as Genestealers.  The combat takes place on derelict, alien infested space vessels know as space hulks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Combat is action point driven and resolved through the use of dice.  The marines have a finite number of figures to use in combat against endless hoards of Genestealers.  The object is to accomplish given missions within their parameters or die trying._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There were significant differences between the 1st edition and this one.  The first being that this version or revision was by Dean Bass and Chris Colston and based on the original game by Richard Halliwell and Paul Murphy.  The most significant difference in this version was the removal of the sand timer and thus the requirement for the marines to accomplish their turn in a limited real-time period. Also the rules of the 2nd edition did not allow the player of the Space Marines to perform actions by using command points in the turn of the Genestealer player.  Another change was the addition of combat specific dice to resolve weapons fire and a special die to resolve gun jams.  A few other minor changes were made to the rules and board graphics as well._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This version contains the initial six missions found in the first edition and adds an additional 12 missions which were different than those in the 1st edition of the Deathwing and Genestealer expansions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Digitally redeveloped into Alien Assault_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Space Hulk 2nd edition, by Games Workshop, 1996. Winner of the Origins Award for Best Fantasy/Science Fiction board game of 1989.  Rare.
Contents nearly new, clean, complete _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; undamaged, with 2 bonus items.
The 10 Terminator figures are snapped together, but are not glued or painted. Decals and banners are still on their original cards and ready for application. There are a total of 6 assembled Genestealer figures and 20 un-assembled. None are painted.
The counters and room tiles look like they were just punched out and are in mint condition. 
Bonus: 2nd edition campaign from an issue of White Dwarf in the late _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;90s titled _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Defilement of Honor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; along with the 5 special air duct tiles the campaign requires.
Bonus: an unofficial copy of the Space Hulk Bible (a collection of rules including house rules for other _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;races_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).
The box is not sturdy and there is some dishing of the box with some bent sides.</notes>
