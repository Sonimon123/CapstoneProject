   <description>Players use different character cards to bring in and move pieces around Kreta which give them influence in the provinces on the island. One of the cards triggers scoring in all the provinces adjacent to a place, and each province gives various Victory Points (VPs) to the 1st and 2nd most influence. At any time, you only know the next two places that will score, so if you cannot gain influence the current place, you can prepare for the next scoring._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player has an identical set of characters, and each character controls certain pieces which have different abilities and limitations in the game. By smart use of your characters and clever timing, you can try to have the scoring occur when you have the most influence, and gain more VPs than the other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But influence changes swiftly, the others can quickly conspire to block your control, and the scoring places can jump from one end of the island to the other, leaving you controlling worthless provinces. Can you make the right choices to gain influence in the right place at the right time, or will you be left watching as someone else takes power in Kreta?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the publisher, Goldsieber: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Settle the most important Cretan provinces with your followers. Build booming cities and increase your influence by building massive towers. Locate your fleet carefully but also try to harvest as many grapes and olives as possible. Only he who best places his Admiral, King, Farmers and Castellan will end up winning the race for power and prestige!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Online Play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;a target='_blank' href=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;http://www.mabiweb.com_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rel=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nofollow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;http://www.mabiweb.com_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;/a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; (turn-based)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Goldsieber (German) Edition.  This copy has been played twice and the game is in excellent condition.
Cost listed includes shipping. I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex and my discretion. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.

    <notes>Opened and punched/bagged but never played. They made a little boo-boo with this copy: they put in an extra house but left out a ship for green (and only the green color, the other colors are OK). Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem like a big deal to me, just turn the extra house upside down and it can pass for a ship. Of course, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve heard that Goldsieber might be able to fix this for you, even here in the U.S., so you could try that too.
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If you order several games from me, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course combine the shipping costs.

==============================================
The games I am selling come from my personal collection. I often have bought games used or traded for them. I will do my best to accurately describe their condition. I 
will confirm completeness in most cases (unless stated otherwise) but not for items that come in large quantities for which a few missing will make no difference (like 
stacks of paper money for example). Please note that I am not concerned about inserts and may have removed them from a game that I felt didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them. I might not 
think to mention that in the description. If you are interested in the insert, please ask.
Note that our home is smoke-free but not pet-free. I can not guarantee the complete absence of cat hair in the boxes
I prefer to ship via USPS Priority. I use non-Flat Rate boxes unless it will save you money for me to use Flat Rate boxes. I buy the postage on-line and charge the 
exact cost to the buyer. I am happy to combine multiple items to save you on shipping
I have perfect feedback here on BGG. On ebay, where I am selling my record collection, I am ronattic, and have 100% positive feedback. So please buy with confidence.</notes>

Payment in advance possible via: 
- IBAN _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; BIC within EU (preferred)
- Amazon Gift Cards
- Paypal (You have to pay the fees, ask about the fees beforehand. You can also send the money as a friend so there will be no fees.)

**********
Shipment Costs depend on where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re living, have a look here: https://www.dhl.de/en/paket/pakete-versenden.html
I will only send without insurance as it is cheaper. If you want to have the shipment with insurance please ask explicitly for that!</notes>
