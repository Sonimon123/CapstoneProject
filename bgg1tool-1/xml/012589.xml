   <description>A card game re-implementation of Knizia's earlier board game Ra with the only notable changes being the re-theme and lack of catastrophes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This time players are mafiosi bidding for the booty stolen the previous night.

Once a lot contains enough desirable items (or when a policeman card is revealed), players bid on the displayed items using the available cheques._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The round ends when all the cheques have been spent, or when enough policemen arrive to raid the building and put an end to the illegal auction. Players then score points according to what cards they have accumulated - some cards are discarded after scoring, while others remain in that player's collection for the following rounds. Whoever has the highest score after the third round is declared the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game comes with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    99 Booty cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    21 Policemen cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    16 Cheques_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 Scoring/Player aid cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 Board_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 Rule booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.

I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Very good condition.  German rules, English rules printout, almost all game components are language-independent.
SHIPPING:
USA: $8.95 shipping in USA.
MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping! So look at my other games for sale. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game.
MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance. (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.
Thank you! I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>My late husband collected board games.  He took excellent care of his games.  They are either gently used or have never been played.  He liked to open the games up to see what they had, however he didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play all of them.  :)
Excellent condition, smoke free home.  If Played, no food or drink were ever allowed near the games.
Thank you!</notes>
