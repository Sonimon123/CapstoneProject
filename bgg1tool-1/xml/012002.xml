The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by buying and selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets.  The game is played with cards which allow players to buy and sell goods, can help you or hinder your opponent, and others which add a bit of spice to the game.  Return to the dark continent where the players alternate turns with up to 5 actions each until one player reaches the goal and wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Original description from Games4You._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from.

And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game's attraction lies with the many special cards.

    <notes>English edition. Has been played several times, but none of the components are showing heavy wear, and the box is also in good shape.
Shipping costs will be true, and based on your chosen options and speed. I ship via USPS. Your options are Parcel Post or Priority and any other extras you would like such as Insurance or Delivery Confirmation.
I pride myself on a fast turnaround time, and am almost always able to get orders out within 1 business day of receiving payment.</notes>

Game Description: Jambo! is the friendly greeting Swahili traders offered their customers in Central Africa before colonization. The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets. The game is played with cards which represent goods, people (which can help you or hinder your opponent), and animals (which add a bit of spice to the game). Players take turns with up to 5 actions per turn until one player reaches the goal and wins the game.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games - Jambo
Language: English
2 player card game
12 year and older
Duration: about 40 min
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 0,400 kg
Theme: Central Africa long before colonization, where trading was an important part of society for hundreds of years. The players are the Swahili traders selling hide, fruits, tea, silk, salt and trinkets for gold. But trading is not easy; as goods need to come from distant places and lions, snakes and crocodiles are everywhere. The game offers many special cards and card combinations which makes each game session different. The art is fantastic and brings an exotic atmosphere.

Please note that I will post to the UK only. P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P for the game is £3 but let me know if you would like to purchase more than one game and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll work out a combined shipping quote for you.</notes>

    <notes>White Goblin Games - Jambo
Language: Dutch
Players: 2
Age: 12+
Duration: about 40 min
Weight: 0.600 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Central Africa long before colonization, where trading was an important part of society for hundreds of years. The players are the Swahili traders selling hide, fruits, tea, silk, salt and trinkets for gold. But trading is not easy; as goods need to come from distant places and lions, snakes and crocodiles are everywhere. The game offers many special cards and card combinations which makes each game session different. The art is fantastic and brings an exotic atmosphere.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 251)
Jambo! is the friendly greeting Swahili traders offered their customers in Central Africa before colonization. The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets. The game is played with cards which represent goods, people (which can help you or hinder your opponent), and animals (which add a bit of spice to the game). Players take turns with up to 5 actions per turn until one player reaches the goal and wins the game.</notes>

    <notes>[size=14][b][u]Comments:[/u][/b][/size] 
To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once.   Excellent condition.
Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top/bottom have some dishing. The rules were missing and a copy was printed and is included.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English. RGG.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>I love this game. This game came out frequently in my old game group, but we moved several years ago. After moving, I bought a copy of Jambo and we have played it twice. In short, my primary gaming partner, my wife, hates it. She doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like games with lots of card combos and this game has a lot of them. After holding on to it for 4 years hoping she would change her mind, I have come to realize that is not going to happen. All cards and components are mint and complete. Shipping: $10 flat rate US/ actual rate to Canada.  Box has moderate shelf wear.</notes>

    <notes>The game was purchased second hand from a Half Price Books. The components were discovered to be new and they are still in excellent condition after 1-2 plays. The box shows a minor amount of normal shelf wear (some minor scuffing but nothing more) and is structurally perfect.
I charge actual shipping cost of USPS Priority Mail or an alternate method of your choice.</notes>
