Hitler issued goals that ranged from the far oil fields to a city on the Volga by the name of Stalingrad, finally deciding not to decide and ordered the far flung Army Group to divide and go for both._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Across endless steppe, in the blazing sun and freezing cold, the Axis legions advanced to the edge of Asia and the Caucasus mountains. Some of the oil fields, and most of the city were taken._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Then the Red Army had its turn..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case Blue is a game that covers both the Axis advance (1941 and 1942) as well as the Soviet counterattacks (Nov 42 to Jan 43) and the German counteroffensive at Kharkov (Feb-March 1943) that ended the series of campaigns in the south. The game covers in great detail all the operations from October 1941 until May 1943 on a large play area extending from Voronezh almost to the Turkish border. The full scope and grandiose nature of these operations come to life here._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case Blue covers and replaces the 1994 award winning game Enemy at the Gates. Players get to encircle Stalingrad, run their pocket and relief attempts and the many operations that game covered._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case Blue is the 10th game in the award winning Operational Combat System and is the result of over 6 years of intensive research and testing. Players control units ranging from battalions through divisions (OK, there are a few very strange companies), making key decisions on the use, objectives, and means of war. The series is based on modern concepts of maneuver warfare and allows players a far more insightful look into how campaigns (large and small) really work._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case Blue is designed to be played both separately or linked to the 2001 game Guderian's Blitzkrieg II. The monster linked game allows players to run operations on the entire Eastern Front (except for Leningrad) from the fall of 1941 until mid-1943._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Multiple scenarios (one map to very large) allow play to be picked up at various key points in the campaign._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If you want a serious look at these pivotal campaigns while having fun at the same time, this is the game for you._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Perhaps the Operational Combat System finest hour, this game is huge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Turn: Half Week_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units: Company to Division_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Inventory:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Nine 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheets (Maps A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 14 x 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheet (Map E)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ten dual-side printed countersheets (2,660 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Unit counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Marker counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 48-page OCS v4.0 series rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 16-page Case Blue game rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 80-page Case Blue Scenario Book 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 48-page Case Blue Scenario Book 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 24-page Case Blue Axis Booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 24-page Case Blue Russian Booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 4-page two-color OCS v4.0 Charts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Tables booklets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is still in shrink.  Condition labelled _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s slight box crunch on the right-hand side due to poor packing by MMP.  I am reasonably sure that the contents are undamaged as that was the case for my other copy that I opened, that had a similar crunch.
Shipping in the US will be $15 for Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box + insurance.  Non US-shipping will be at cost (game + packaging will be about 7.5 pounds/3.4 kg); customs and duties will be the responsibility of the buyer.
I accept PayPal, check, or USPS MO for US buyers, and Paypal only for non-US buyers. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for a brand new unused and undamaged ziplock copy of the game in perfect condition. The game was purchased direct from MMP without a box or dice during their warehouse move after they came across enough copies of Case Blue to create a limited number of ziplocked sets of the game.
All reasonable offers will be considered.
Delivery charges:
Within the UK - Parcelforce express48 including full insurance ¬£20.
Outside of the UK the cost is likely to be very expensive given its weight- please geekmail.
Buyer responsible for all Customs charges.
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs, postage for Europe and the rest of the world is by airmail with delivery confirmation/tracking.
I can combine multiple purchases to reduce shipping costs where possible.
UK buyers can send a personal cheque or use paypal plus 3.9% (unless funds sent as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;gift_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;) all others must use paypal.</notes>

    <notes>To circumvent the Italian postage rates, this game was originally purchased as still being in it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shrinkwrap, but the shrinkwrap was partially removed so facilitate shipping in two seperate packages.
As part of a mass sell-off, sadly Case Blue has to go. It really is as new, with none of the components having been handled/read.
Pristine condition.
Please contact me for shipping costs. I will pack the game so as to ensure it reaches you in exactly the same condition it leaves me.

    <notes>This game has never been played. The counter sheets are unpunched, the rulebooks, OOB booklets, Scenario booklets unread.
There are two issues which would stop this being classified as 100% pristine.
1) There is a small dink/depression on the top left corner of the box (see photo), presumably as a result of transit. As can be seen it is very minor.
2) Map A has a small tear (half a hex in diameter) at the bottom left edge (see photo). Unless you knew it were there, you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see it when the map is laid out.
Please contact me for shipping costs, I will pack very safely/securely.
Postage in the UK is: GBP 19.25
Postage to Europe varies by destination, but to give an example - postage to Germany would be GBP 29.90.
Postage to the USA would be GBP 50.98

    <notes>Unpunched.  Contents verified complete and in like new condition.  This is big.  This is massive.  You will spend hours setting it up.  You will stare at it on end in your basement.  Your dog will miss you.  Your kids will miss you.  Your wife will..........nah.  Your cat will think you are crazy - your cat.  You will gain weight and stop showering.  You will start to eat Cheetos and drink chocolate milk.  You hate Cheetos.  Army Group South OCS style.  You know you have to set it up - give in to it.  NOT A PERFECT BOX.  SEE PICS BELOW.  Box is square and straight with 4 strong tight corners.  Corner creases front and back per pictures.  A goodly amount of corner rubbing.    Worldwide shipping and will be packed well.  All forms of negotiable instruments considered.  Combine ship with multiple purchases.  Its all here minus the Cheetos.</notes>

With the exception of the box, all other components are in excellent condition. The box is a little rough with some creases on the corners.</notes>

The box shows signs of wears and tears (those MMP boxes of those times are not too great for that).

    <notes>This copy is in good to very good condition - 80% unpunched.  All components are accounted for and in fact this copy has an extra countersheet #1 (completely unpunched). The Axis and Soviet books are lightly stained (on cover) and highlighted, but only to a small degree. Box has light shelf wear.
Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
