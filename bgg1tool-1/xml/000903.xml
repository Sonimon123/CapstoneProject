    <notes>The game is complete and in excellent condition. It was only played once.
I prefer to ship via UPS for tracking reasons, so shipping will vary depending on the destination. The package will be well packed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting this for sale a little low because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to reduce my collection in prepration for my move. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting more games soon, so keep a eye out for those as well.

    <notes>RIO Grande Games (RIO 035)
Game Description: The wooden wheel is divided into twelve sections by small barriers. The players have to try to get rid of their game pieces by placing them skilfully into these sections.The wheel automatically starts rolling when the pieces are placed. The thrill is that once it is rolling, you might get pieces you do not want. The winner is the one who first got rid of his pieces.It´s a crazy roundabout game for the whole family and players of all ages.

    <notes>The game is still shrinkwrapped. This is the first Zoch edition from 2000. There is a 1-inch split in the shrinkwrap on one side - when it was shrinkwrapped it looks like there just wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t enough plastic on the one side. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>
