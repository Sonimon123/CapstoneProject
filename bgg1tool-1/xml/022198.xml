   <description>This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Condition notes: Great Wall of China - Open, but in excellent condition inside and out. All contents accounted for.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the process of cleaning out the game cabinet. Look back for more deals later. For open and played games, expect prices below what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay at an online discounter. 
Shipping: I will ship most games USPS Priority Mail using a flat rate box plus Shipping Confirmation - Actual Cost: $10.45. For some games, you may be able to obtain a cheaper rate if you contact me before purchasing. I will attempt to get you the cheapest and most timely shipping possible.
All games come from a non-smoking, careful environment. I hope you enjoy owning and playing these games as much as I have.
I accept Paypal or Money Order or Cashiers Check. 
I do not accept personal checks because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship your game quickly with that payment method.
Currently only shipping to the U.S. If you are in a foreign country and really want one of these games, contact me and I will try to accommodate you - be aware that international shipping costs may be substantially higher.</notes>

    <notes>Complete.  Box opened, but the pieces inside are still in shrink.
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately. 
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost. I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.
Thank you</notes>

    <notes>GREAT WALL OF CHINA: New in shrinkwrap. No marks or other visible damage on box. For sale by old school gamer selectively reducing his collection. All my games are stored in plastic bins in a climate controlled environment.
SHIPPING: When I ship I package thoroughly as if I were receiving the game myself. Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear first before I ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace.</notes>
