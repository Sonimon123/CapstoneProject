Designed by Friedemann de Pedro
World War 2 air combat game depicting the nighttime air raids of British bombers hitting German cities.
As the head of the British Bomber Command, you plan the attacks on Germany in order to undermine the morale of the civilian population. Or as a General of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), you defend using your ace squadrons and organizing an effective civil defense.
The gameboard enables you to set up countless variations of these historic events. You play as many nights as you wish - each night takes 30-45 minutes to resolve.
Immerse yourself in the strategic and tactical thinking needed to survive in those dark times.
Gameplay allows for easy entry into the action with some advanced rules for the hearty wargamer. The game rules include weather conditions, full moon/new moon bonuses and penalties, clouds and thunderclouds, fog, flak, searchlights, balloon barriers, target markers, and much more.
The British player secretly plots the course of the bomber while the Mosquito acts as escort or decoy. The German player tries to figure out where the bomber is going, making sure to efficiently use the fuel to get as many hits on the bomber as possible.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7016)
World War 2 air combat game depicting the nighttime air raids of British bombers hitting German cities.
As the head of the British Bomber Command, you plan the attacks on Germany in order to undermine the morale of the civilian population. Or as a General of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), you defend using your ace squadrons and organizing an effective civil defense.
The gameboard enables you to set up countless variations of these historic events. You play as many nights as you wish - each night takes 30-45 minutes to resolve.
Immerse yourself in the strategic and tactical thinking needed to survive in those dark times.
Gameplay allows for easy entry into the action with some advanced rules for the hearty wargamer. The game rules include weather conditions, full moon/new moon bonuses and penalties, clouds and thunderclouds, fog, flak, searchlights, balloon barriers, target markers, and much more.
The British player secretly plots the course of the bomber while the Mosquito acts as escort or decoy. The German player tries to figure out where the bomber is going, making sure to efficiently use the fuel to get as many hits on the bomber as possible.

    <notes>First edition. The components are in excellent condition and in like new condition. The game has been played twice.  Unfortunately this copy had some box mold but it seems that it was exclusively on the box and not the components.   I let it bake in the summer sun after i got  and it has not spread so I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s dead.  I can ship w/ or without the box. It won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect domestic shipping that much.  Shipping within the US $10.95.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the 2nd Edition that includes 9 little expansions.   It has been played 1 time and the plastic pieces were pushed through the holes in the pieces.  The underside of the pieces is pushed outward around the plastic piece as is normal for this game.  Also, 1 of the German planes has a wrinkle across the top side.  The game has no smell or moisture issues.  I charge true shipping costs and will gladly combine. </notes>

    <notes>This is for the game and The Complete Edition expansion.  The outer shrinkwrap for the base game was removed so that I could include the expansion in the box, but the components are not punched and the cards are still shrinkwrapped.  The expansion is still factory sealed.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He loved his games and took excellent care of them!  If they were played, we no food or drink was allowed.  Smoke free environment...   He passed away in 2012 and it is time for the games to find new homes.  Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>DUEL IN THE DARK, including the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Complete Expansions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; bag of expansion pieces. Note that this does not include Baby Blitz. Bought, opened, insert assembled but never played. No marks or other visible damage. For sale by old school gamer selectively reducing his collection. All my games are stored in plastic bins in a climate controlled environment.
SHIPPING: When I ship I package thoroughly as if I were receiving the game myself. Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear first before I ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace.</notes>

I also _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;customised_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; the insert so that it would actually fit inside the box to allow the components to be stored along with the board - the way they designed it originally it would not do the latter - doh! 
Also contains the following mini-expansions - Acoustic Mirror, British 3.7in QF AA Gun, Early Nights, Ju88 Night Fighter, Quad Flak, Railroad Flak, Tactical Cards, The Walls Have Ears, V1-Bunker.
I have the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Baby Blitz_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; expansion available separately.
