   <description>In Pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Stack the players try to fill their trucks as perfectly as possible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players start each round with a random selection of different-sized goods, determine by the roll of several dice. Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods.  Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck. Players get negative scores if the truck they picked was too large (a lot of unused space at 1 point per unused space) or too small (a lot of goods don't fit at 2 points per space of goods that would not fit).  The player who gets the lowest negative score in a round gains 10 points.  Players _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pay_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; points  for their negative values, and rounds continue until at least one player no longer has any points; the player with the most points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s moving day! You have lots of boxes to load, and a truck to load them into-but how are they going to fit? Maybe on their ends? Stacked on top of each other? You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to pack your unique truck as tightly as possible, and you lose points for packing too few pieces on your truck, or for leaving pieces you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit behind. Can you pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em, stack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em and rack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em with the best?
Pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Stack is a fast and funny, wild and crazy game about moving stuff on all sorts of odd trucks. Every interactive turn is a new adventure, where all the players discover new loads, grab new trucks, and then gamble on their planning and packing skills. So, test your wits and find your cool. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to get packin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and start stackin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;! 
Pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Stack is a casual, social game for 3-6 players ages 10 and older. You can play in 30-45 minutes.</notes>

In Pack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Stack the players try to fill their trucks as perfectly as possible.
Players start each round with a random selection of different-sized goods, determine by the roll of several dice. Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods. Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck. Players get negative scores if the truck they picked was too large (a lot of unused space at 1 point per unused space) or too small (a lot of goods don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit at 2 points per space of goods that would not fit). The player who gets the lowest negative score in a round gains 10 points. Players _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pay_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; points for their negative values, and rounds continue until at least one player no longer has any points; the player with the most points wins.
