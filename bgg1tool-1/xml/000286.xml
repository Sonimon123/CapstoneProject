   <description>Machiavelli recreates the historical situation of the fast developing and ever shifting balance of power struggle in Renaissance Italy. There are five major powers: The Republics of Florence and Venice, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy (which was a secular power in this era) along with 3 major foreign powers: Valois France, Hapsburg Austria and the Ottoman Turks. All of these states singly or in combination compete for control of the peninsula._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Alea Magazine nº22 contained seven new scenarios for Machiavelli._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The final edition of this classic multi-player game of Power Politics in Renaissance Italy.  This 1995 edition was a revision of the 1980 version, with a beautiful new mapboard, cleaned up rules, and stunning new counters.  Game was based on the diplomacy area movement system, but also incorporates finances, natural disasters, sieges, rebellions, and assassinations!!  Overall, one of the finer multi-player games ever produced!
Game is punched but complete, includes mapboard, 520 counters, 8 conference maps, rulebook, and die.  All components are in near mint condition - no tears, stains, or writing.  Game box is solid, with no split corners, tears, or writing.  Some very minor shelf wear is the only flaw in this otherwise excellent copy.  </notes>

    <notes>AH bookcase (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;95) version. Complete and in very good condition. Minor shelf wear on box, but contents look unplayed. Counters manifest is as follows: three powers have 53 counters each, four have 45 each, and Papacy has 49; 120 misc counters, plus 12 blanks (not included), brings the total to 520 of 520.

    <notes>This is the Battleline edition, which is identical to the Avalon Hill 1st edition except for the unmounted mapboard (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy card stock). The counters are superior, though, being twice the thickness of the AH ones. 
CONDITION: Very good condition overall, contents very lightly used and complete, with partially-punched counters (about 2/3rds punched, sorted and bagged).  The box is near perfect, just with one neatly repaired corner.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £4.50
European Postage: £6.00
Rest of World Postage: £11.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.

SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).
CUSTOMS:
Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.
Defective or damaged items can be returned for an exchange or refund within 7 days of the delivery date. All returns require authorization from me BEFORE returning the item.</notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £10.50
Rest of World Postage: £21.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:

    <notes>Boxed Battleline 1st edition with the thick counters (superior to AH reprint).
Punched, sorted and bagged. All components in near new condition. It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look to have been played. Verified complete.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>1983 Second Edition.  Opened, but unpunched/unplayed.  Box is in excellent shape save for a small, 1/2 inch spot where pervious owner wrote 2.95 on the cover.  Difficult to notice unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for it.
Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.</notes>

    <notes>1995 2nd edition.
Complete with all 508 actual counters (looks like a few of the blank counters are missing).  I counted the counters to confirm their completeness.  All 8 conference maps are included and in excellent condition with no writing.  Board and rules also in great condition.  The box is in very good condition with no split corners or dishing-- just edgewear typical for a game this age.
Buyer to pay shipping-- actual shipping cost only-- this will be determined by package weight and zip code.</notes>
