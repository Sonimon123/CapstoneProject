   <description>In Roads _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game (3rd edition) and expansion are not in shrinkwrap - the manufacturer doesn´t deliver them in shrinkwrap. Of cause still unpunched and unplayed just as I bought them. The expansion for the third edition of Roads _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Boats (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;cetera) adds new buildings, new goods, new land types, new transporters, ... 24 new scenarios, the material to play with 5 or 6 players. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;cetera contains all the rules and material previously published as Planes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Trains, plus a lot more and is compatible with 2nd and 3rd edition sets. I was able to buy the expansion yesterday at the fair in Essen. I think it is only a question of time that they will be sold out totally. 
Ask me with any questions (shipping costs, ...). Of cause everything will be packed very careful with bubble wrap,... </notes>

    <notes>Third, and best edition of the game along with a mint, unpunched copy of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Cetera, the expansion (see seperate BGG entry for more details). The box on Roads has wear, most of which occured in shipping from Germany due to poor packing. Corners have some dings, and there is some crushing on the the box top, somewhat inevitable with a game of this size unless one has an entire shelf to set aside for it.
All components present and accounted for, and the chits are all organised in a tackle box which fits inside the main box nicely. The rules and scenario booklet are in English.
Shipping on this item will be true cost and based on your chosen speed and options. I will throw in delivery confirmation for free with your order though.
If you have any qualms in dealing with me check out my ebay account (user id: cortex-bomb) where I have been dealing since 1999 with zero negative feedback to date, or even my activity here on the Geek.
As soon as you order the item and pay I will confirm, and then ship the same day, the next business day at the latest. I pride myself on a fast turnaround time, and I know that if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying a high end item like this that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be eager to get it onto the table. 
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t miss this unique chance to get a rare game, with its expansion for less than you would pay for only the base game shipped from Europe, and in 1/4 of the time to boot...!</notes>

    <notes>Rare handmade first edition. Does not include plastic overlay sheet (Splotter told international purchasers of first edition to buy acrylic sheets locally. The included sheet for this version was a 1/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; thick not-flexible sheet instead of the roll in later versions.) This first edition does support 5 players. 
Also includes Original Planes and Trains expansion. 
Also includes second edition (flat colored) hex tiles. 
Also includes third edition wooden transportation markers. (4 colors only. The first and second editions used flat wooden disks with labels on them.)
Moo,
Frank

The game has been played almost once.  All bits have been carefully punched and organized into 5 Plano boxes which I will include.  Pieces are in excellent condition.
There is slight wear on Roads and Boats box due to Splotter having flimsy boxes.  I no longer have the expansion box.
PayPal drawn from checking, regular check, money order are all fine forms of payment.
Note: this is heavy.  UPS will probably be the best way to go.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a copy of Roads and Boats Second Edition.  This is the German edition but the components are language neutral and there is a print out of the English rules. Also included is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cetera.  The compoents for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cetera are mixed in with the main game. This expansion was dual published in English and German although the parts of language neutral as well.  Everything is complete and in excellent condition.  The pieces are bagged and stored in a plano type container.  The games have never been used.
I ship to the United States only. I prefer paypal payments but I accept money orders as well. I will ship once I receive payment.
I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion. While I take every measure to make sure the game is packed carefully and well, I cannot be responsible for damages caused during shipping. Insurance is available to the buyer at cost.
Shipping is $16.00 due to the oversized box.

    <notes>Includes base game and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; cetera expansion.
I got this game from someone who sold it because they never played it. I am selling it because I never get to play it. I played it one time solo and I loved it but I know my group will not play it. So, it is off trying to find a good home. This includes the game and the new expansion. Includes plano boxes. The game is very heavy so shipping in the US is $25. I will ship worldwide but be prepared for an high shipping cost. Non-US customers please email me for a shipping quote before purchasing. I accept Paypal.

    <notes>The box top has an outward bow and is concave. One corner of the box top has a ~1 inch wrinkle (probably from a game which rested on top of it). The box bottom shows dirt. The rules, (many) cardboard counters, mine cylinders, wooden counters, glass stones, boards, rules, scenario book, and player aids are all in very good condition. One half of the wonder has a few light ~2 mm long indentations.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. (And please remember that this is a big game.) That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>Third edition.
New and unused.
This game does not come in shrinkwrap, and like most copies, has minor box issues as a result, and due to box size/shape.
Shipping this will be a bear; in addition, if I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have an appropriate box, one will need to be paid for.</notes>

    <notes>This includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;cetera expansion.
The base game has been punched and played once.  The expansion is still in the giant zip lock bag it was sold in.
I sorted the resource tokens into a plastic organizer box that fits neatly into the game box.  This is included.  In fact, the organizer, base game components, and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;cetera all fit perfectly into the huge box from the base game.  All the game materials are in excellent shape and the box looks brand new.
Shipping will be $17.00.</notes>

    <notes>Price includes Roads and Boats plus the Et Cetera expansion
Roads and Boats - 3rd edition, original German rules plus English printouts of rules and player aids. Plastic overlay is rather squashed and not in good condition (although unused - we found it easier to use a plexiglass sheet). Bits and counters complete and sorted into ziplock bags, no obvious wear and tear. Played a few times.
Et Cetera - Like new, unpunched and unplayed, German and English rules, comes in a ziplock bag.
Will sell Et Cetera on its own if wanted, £35 plus £3.50 shipping within the UK.
UK shipping options for the pair:
Standard Parcels - £8.50, No tracking, compensation up to £46
Parcelforce 48 - £13.50. Guaranteed 2 day delivery, tracking, compensation up to £50.
Parcelforce 24 - £18.50 - Guaranteed 1 day delivery, tracking, compensation up to £100.
Please let me know your preferred shipping option when you order, so I can request the correct total amount from you.
I can combine shipping for multiple purchases. If you are in the Eastbourne or Brighton areas please feel free to ask about collecting the game locally.
For shipping outside the UK please contact me for options.
I accept Paypal or cash on collection.
Thanks for looking :)

    <notes>The game was only played once (solo).
Stickers page for mines has missing stickers (I received it this was from Splotter); however, the page is nothing substantial as far as components go.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just an ordinary printout.
All payments must be received prior to shipping.  (I do this because I was stiffed once.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have any negative feedback for doing likewise to anyone else.)</notes>

    <notes>Like new - MINT condition.
This is the Third Edition and INCLUDES the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;cetera expansion!!!
The game has been played only once and is in MINT condition.  All componants are included and have been bagged. 
Full disclosure: There is one small defect to the box bottom - about the size of a dime or pencil eraser.  (I recieved the game with this _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ding_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; when I purchased it new (not that it makes a difference).  I am meticulous with my games and the box doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have any shelf wear and is NOT _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;dished_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. See images below.
I accept paypal.
This game is heavy (approx 7 lbs) and the Splotter Boxes are notoriously flimsy...
I will ship this in an oversized box with extra packing material - as a result it will cost extra to ship.  I will ship FedEx ground - cost is $30 to lower 48 states.
Feel free to geekmail me with any questions...</notes>

    <notes>This is in excellent condition.  Third Edition.
Plano divider is included in the box.
Buyer Prepays plus Shipping.  Shipping charges are likely to be kind of high for this one.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing $20 or so, depending upon your location, but the charges will be the exact charges.  Plus probably a small packaging fee, as I think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to buy a special box if I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t scrounge one up.  
Insurance will also be required on this item, for both of our protections.</notes>

    <notes>I am an Amazon seller and both of my copies were returns.  Both games are open, with shrink removed.  I inventoried both games and everything is included.  The only thing I noticed was the plastic folder had a bend in the near the corner.  Other than that, the inside of boxes seem like new condition.  Unless I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m mistaken, I believe one of them has components punched out already, but I forget as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m at work.  Please message me on details if that concerns you, but all components are still in box and in good shape.  Nothing appears to have been used.
The box is the reason I believe for the returns.  It still has its integrity, but on the front of the box there is a very large indentation like it was improperly shipped.  The rest of the box is in good shape.
I will upload images soon.  If I forget, message me if interested and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get it done.  Shipping will be $10, but only to lower 48 states.  Local pickup available in Austin Texas.</notes>

    <notes>I have played this game once. The box has a slight dishing on the bottom. I bought the game new and this is how it came. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s almost unavoidable with a box this size.)
This fourth edition was notable for small money counters that were printed too dark. I used the file supplied by Splotter to make stickers that I applied to these counters.

    <notes>NOTE: Local Toronto area pick-up strongly preferred. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the Yonge/Davisville area in midtown. The box is huge and shipping would be very costly.
Like new, played once. Excellent condition copy of Roads and Boats.
Everything punched and sorted into Plano box.
Bought this from BoardGameBliss. It came with the Replacement Tiles to fix the misprint of bronze-coloured coins.</notes>

    <notes>Played twice. The box top has approximately an 8-inch wrinkle because the box is so large that it tends to cave in a little. The components are in excellent condition and are beautifully sorted into a $10 plastic box and a gmt counter tray, which are included in the price. 
I plan to sell this ONLY with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; cetera expansion because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s already sorted and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to separate all the base game components from the expansion. The expansion is listed separately but you should plan on buying both if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested. There is no box with the expansion; it was sold in a large resealable plastic bag and it all fits in the base game box.</notes>

    <notes>Immaculately cared for Roads _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Boats game. Box has been kept under plastic, everything is like new - including the small coin tokens which are known to have been misprinted with too dark a contrast in this edition. There are replacements available from Splotter if inclined, though the difference is only cosmetic.
Price is in CAD, I will accept CAD/USD by Paypal or Canadian Interac EMT.
The box is quite large so expect shipping to run $20-$25 probably in Canada and more elsewhere. I will ship anywhere, contact me for a quote. I already have the box set aside and dimensions to figure it out.</notes>

    <notes>Very good condition save a for a tear on one of the box corners, played once, includes the expansion.
Please note, shipping internationally is very expensive. You can verify how much it will cost you approximately by going to the Canada Post website and sending from J4W 2L8 to your address with the following parameters:
Size: 20.13 x 12.50 x 2.63 inches or 51.1 x 31.8 x 6.7 cm
Weight: 5.15 lbs or 2.3 kg
I say approximately because unless I wrap it in brown paper (and nobody wants that), the box will add both size and weight to those numbers. So you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll end up paying more than that estimate.
Second note, while I will accept paypal, I will add 10% to the cost to pay for their merchant fees. My preference is to be paid by interac eTransfer (for which I would be willing to deduct a dollar from the final cost to make up for the interact charge to your account).</notes>

    <condition>acceptable</condition>
    <notes>The copy is listed as acceptable because of the following either minor or fixable issues:
1) the box lid is bowed a bit inward with minor creasing just inside the top edges. Something heavy must have been stored on it. And the outside box bottom must have gotten very dirty at one time. It was definitely _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wiped_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in an attempt to clean it, but the bottom still is dirty. However the inside of the box bottom is in excellent condition, and the top only bows in approximately an eighth of an inch, and the contents of the box are in good to very good condition.
2) the game is missing the original plastic sheet and marker that goes with it (I received it in trade that way and chose to play with spare wood rods, not included in that or this trade, instead of drawing roads on plastic). I have a 19_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x40_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; vinyl plastic sheet bought at Walmart ($2) to replace it. It would be up to you to replace the marker (wet eraser markers or grease pencils are probably better than a dry erase marker).
3) some of the original stickers on the clear plastic mine bags fell off and got lost. I replaced all the stickers with a set I printed. Also, I replaced a lost clear plastic mine bag with a near matching one. These changes look good and will never affect play.
4) one small resource chit (out of over 800) is missing. It should never affect play.</notes>

All components and box are in like new condition otherwise. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only listing it as Very Good condition because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve altered the counters, but I think you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find them to be better than non-clipped counters.

    <notes>This is a complete copy of Roads and Boats 4th Edition. The components are all generally in very good condition; there may be some very minor tearing or peeling on a few of the chits, but I noticed none on a quick inspection. The box has some damage at the corners, which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve tried to show clearly in the photographs. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also throwing in two bead boxes for sorting the chits, shown in the pictures.
UK postage is £8.50 with Collect Plus. European buyers please enquire about shipping prices, but they are likely to be prohibitively expensive.</notes>

    <notes>Very playable and enjoyable copy but not without its flaws:
- Purchased as a ding and dent, so the box has some general wear. Most notably is a gouge on the bottom that has been taped up and reinforced. One tile was damaged upon opening but has since been replaced
- Small stain on box bottom
- Mint goods were misprinted as black instead of gold. Never had the publisher replace these since the game is still playable and fine with the misprint
Other than that the game has been played only a few times and well taken care of. May be tough to find a cheaper copy</notes>

-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use PayPal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
No longer in shrink, but still unpunched/unused/unplayed.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Listed as very good because the game has been punched and played a few times. However, it is in really excellent condition. Includes the et cetera expansion, which has never been played. Also comes with two Plano-style boxes for organizing the components, so that you will be able to play immediately. (See photos.) Game is all ready to go!
Local pickup in SF Bay Area preferred. I can ship, though, and still have the tough original box in which it traveled from Splotter in the Netherlands to California! Feel free to contact me to discuss shipping and insurance before purchasing if desired.</notes>

Includes both Roads and Boats and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Et Cetera expansion.  75% punched and baggied with about 25% of pieces still needing punched. Box lid shows very light wear in corners from storage. 
Shipping only to U.S. Will do in most cost effective way possible/desired in coordination with the buyer. Local pickup in Pittsburgh or Western PA. Also very willing to wait to coordinate potential exchange in person. We occasionally make it to the larger cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest in the course of a summer (e.g. D.C., Baltimore, Philly, New York, Cleveland, Detroit). Will also be at WBC in summer 2018.</notes>

    <notes>Basically like-new--it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just that I consider like-new to mean never-used. 
Includes plastic box with compartments for storage of pieces, and a set of black wooden pieces (like the wall pieces, but black) for use as roads (if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to play with the plastic overlay and markers)</notes>

    <notes>Includes base game, planes and tranes, and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; cetera expansions, and a plano divider will be included. There are also various laminated player aids, but the original plastic covering is not included (plexi works much better). If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in pictures, please contact me.
This box is large and heavy, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to meet in the VA/NC area if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wish to pay for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Includes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Cetera expansion.
Opened but unplayed.  Box cover has some dishing and minor wear from storage on the shelf.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll call the components _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;partially punched_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because some of the tiles have become unpunched just from moving around in the box.
This game box is large and somewhat heavy.  Measures roughly 20_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, so just long enough that it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the USPS large flat rate game box.
Local pickup is available in the Danbury, CT or Poughkeepsie, NY area.</notes>
