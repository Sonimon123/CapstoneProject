   <description>Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s capital._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;burned._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;* 1 Rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG WHC01)
The Invasion Begins...
The Old World seethes with ancient rivalries and boils in the cauldron of savage warfare. Enemies and allies alike face off against one another to settle ancient claims, and to live the glory of battle for themselves.
Brought to you by famed designer Eric M. Lang, Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy’s capital.
Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos? Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG WHC01)
The Invasion Begins...
The Old World seethes with ancient rivalries and boils in the cauldron of savage warfare. Enemies and allies alike face off against one another to settle ancient claims, and to live the glory of battle for themselves.
Brought to you by famed designer Eric M. Lang, Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy’s capital.
Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos? Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?</notes>

- includes first two big box expansions (Assault on Ulthuan and March of the Damned)
- As well as all Corruption Cycle Battle Packs (The Skavenblight Threat, Path of the Zealot, Tooth and Claw, The Deathmaster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Dance, The Warpstone Chronicles, and Arcane Fire)
- And all Enemy Cycle Battle Packs (The Burning of Derricksburg, The Fall of Karak Grimaz, The Silent Forge, Redemption of a Mage, The Fourth Waystone, and Bleeding Sun)</notes>

    <notes>This is a package deal of:
1 core set            (220 cards representing 4 factions)
1 Assault on Ulthuan  (large expansion with 3 60 card packs)
1 March of the Damned (large expansion with 3 60 card packs)
1 Legends             (large expansion with 3 60 card packs)
1 corruption cycle    (6 40 card packs)
1 enemy cycle         (6 60 card packs)
total: 1360 cards (if my math is correct)
At retail at lowest online price (coolstuffinc.) this is 187.00 worth of cards.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this set of cards for 90.00 in very good to like new condition. Cards are packed into a Thunderstone expansion box with dividers and organized into the 6 factions and neutral cards. All other game components are bagged and packed into the core set box. 
Cards are not sleeved. They are of a high quality and show very little to no wear. The sets have the appearance of being new. I do have all the boxes for all the expansions and cycle packs and can ship those as well if requested, but will increase shipping cost due to extra bulk.
Shipping and handling will be estimated 15.00 for weight and size via UPS or USPS.
Will ship as soon as payment clears. Payment will be done through a paypal request for $90.00 + shipping costs

    <notes>I have two copes of the Core Set, Assault on Ulthuan and the original 40-card printings of the first three Battle Packs in the Corruption Cycle. 
I have one copy of March of the Damned and the first two Battle Packs of the Enemy Cycle. 
This variety of cards is a great way to get into the game with all six factions. 
These cards have seen varying amounts of play, but aside from some very minor white around the edges, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in fine condition. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have sweaty hands and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play games while I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m eating food. 
This is $225 worth of cards that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering. The listed price is for the whole set, but certain bits of it might be negotiable on their own. </notes>

    <notes>This offer is for the basic Warhammer: Invasion and the following deluxe and smaller packs. These cards have been either kept in sleeves or in binder page sheets. Mailing cost is the maximum and based on location I will only charge actual to ship cost. If you are overseas you will pay for exact shipping that will be in excess of $35.
My offer is to send you the cards, counters, rules and boards in the large main box and not to add to your shipping by adding in each deluxe and battle pack box. If you want all the pack sleeves and boxes that will increase the shipping.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGWHC01)
The Invasion Begins... The Old World seethes with ancient rivalries and boils in the cauldron of savage warfare. Enemies and allies alike face off against one another to settle ancient claims, and to live the glory of battle for themselves. Brought to you by famed designer Eric M. Lang, Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s capital. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and maneuverable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos? Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction? </notes>

Additionally, I have the boxes the Core Sets came in, as well as the extra copies of the faction boards, the rulebook, one set of unpunched tokens, and another set still on the cardboard.  Almost all of the cards are sleeved, with the exception of the extra duplicate cards from the Battle Packs, etc, that go beyond a legal playset, per the rules of the game.  None of the unsleeved cards were played with.
Shipping to be paid by the buyer.  Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you the actual cost based on where you want me to send it.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want the rulebook and boxes, I can condense the cards/tokens/faction boards down into a smaller package to keep the costs down.  If you live in the Toronto area, I can always meet you in person and cut out the shipping altogether.</notes>

    <notes>This is a very large collection all packed into a card box (see picture).  Two core sets included.  Deluxe expansions Legends, March of the Damned, and Assault on Ulthuan.  Several small expansion packs are also included (somewhere in the range of 15-20).  Sorry I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not going to search for any particular expansion as there are tons.   This is a great lot for someone who wants to get started in the game as it comes with all races and hundreds of cards.  
None of the original boxes are included as they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve all been long thrown away.   This is a heavy shipment and the buyer will be charged $20 for shipping to USA.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and played several times, in excellent condition. All cards are in sleeves.  Also the game includes a new box to hold expansions you might want to buy - the original box is no longer included.  This new box is great - made of a stiff foam core-type material - shoebox size.  Awesome way to store the cards, way better than the original box and insert.  Also includes laminated cheat sheets to help play the game.  See pictures for detail.  
Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.</notes>

    <notes>Contains 2 copies of the core set
1 copy of everything released. This means that for the 40 card versions and the first deluxe expansion I only have one copy so not a full playset of every card, but very close to a complete collection.  Also contains promotional contested villages and some of the acrylic burn tokens. I should still have the original cardboard tokens somewhere, but there is a very slight chance I accidentally disposed of them. No original packaging sorry. 
Add $20 shipping in Canada, $30 in USA. 
Please note: Canada Post can potentially strike soon, provided they have not at time of purchase, it will for sure leave country in time since they have to give 72 hours notice. Just message me beforehand to make sure :) UPS or FedEx may still be cheap enough but will have to get quotes first.</notes>

    <notes>Included in this lot:
-Warhammer: Invasion Core Game
-Complete Corruption Cycle (6x Battle Packs):
    -The Skavenblight Threat
    -Path of the Zealot
    -Tooth and Claw
    -The Deathmaster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Dance
    -The Warpstone Chronicles
    -Arcane Fire
-Deluxe Expansion:

This copy of Warhammer: Invasion has been played twice. All cards, tokens, player boards, and game box are in factory condition (some cards are still shrink wrapped). This game has been properly stored in a child-free, pet-free and smoke-free home. I no longer have the time to play unfortunately, so I decided to put the game up for sale. All components are accounted for and are as they were from the factory.
Shipping and handling will cost $12.00 (due to the weight of the large number of included components) and will be shipped out the following business day after confirmation of payment via paypal. Additionally, a tracking number will be provided once the package has been shipped.
If you have any additional questions feel free to send me a message via BGG. I also offer free pickup if the buyer is located in Rochester, NY.</notes>

    <notes>Bought the lot a few years ago in excellent condition via ebay and played it twice so far. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know why, but the lots of cards were somehow rather discouraged than stimulated us from building more decks and trying new combinations. The lot comes without any original box as there are simply too many cards. The cards are basically unplayed.
Please be aware that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not every single weekend at my parent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s home (where the game is stored), thus shipping ca be delayed a bit. If you want to go sure, just ask me in advance.
The lot includes
at least 1x Base set 
Never figured out exactly what the previous seller did here, apparently he also added figures from up to two other base set to his collection. As such there are also two manuals included

If you want the cards only, shipping is $4.00 for First Class Mail. If you want the box and all its contents, shipping is $14.00 for Priority Mail (which includes insurance). PayPal payment can be sent to bitva2@yahoo.com, thanks!</notes>
