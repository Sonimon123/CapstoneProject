   <description>Tunisia: The Tunisian Theater of Operations, November 1942 to May 1943, is about the campaign in Northwest Africa from November, 1942 through May, 1943. It covers the end of the Axis presence on the African continent as well as the death of the Afrika Korps and the surrender of all Axis forces in Africa, May 1943._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tunisia is the third game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Notice to buyers and sellers: There maybe a discrepancy in the counter manifest depending on when the game was collated.  It has been posted on Consim that because Tunisia had a long run, that the later copies may have a newer version of the of the generic OCS countersheet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The original game had four countersheets. The inventory listed in the game specific rule book has the following. Two sheets numbered 1 and 2. These have the unit counters for the various sides depicted in the game. Countersheet 3 has 80 generic OCS makers. Sheet 4 is listed as having 140 counters and has more generic OCS counters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the discussion on Consim it seem that it is possible some copies had the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Countersheet 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; replaced with a sheet labeled _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Countersheet OCS Markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. So be aware that it is possible that there are two different counter mixes for this game. One with the newer version of the generic OCS counters (with 280 counters.)  and the original _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Countersheet 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; with a 140 countersheet. Also note it should be one OR the other, not both._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Turn: 1/2 week_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units: Battalion to Division_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Inventory:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 2 markers - 780 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 40-page OCS version v2.0i rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 24-page Tunisia specific rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 4-sided OCS v2.0i Charts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Tables booklets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One Counter Stowage Tray_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity: High_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Solitaire Suitability: High_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players: 1 or more_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: 2-50 Hours_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50
European Postage: £7.50
Rest of World Postage: £14.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS: 
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment. 
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice. 
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS: 
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).
CUSTOMS:
Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.

This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS:
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment.
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice.
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS:
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months! There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).
CUSTOMS:
Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.
Defective or damaged items can be returned for an exchange or refund within 7 days of the delivery date. All returns require authorization from me BEFORE returning the item.</notes>

Copy is from my personal collection.  This game is getting tough to find, so grab it while you can.  It is one of the best intro games to OCS.

    <notes>This is a new copy in shrinkwrap.  However, the box has slight damage - one of the corners is pushed in somewhat.  It is not pierced or torn and fully expect the components inside to be fine.
Non-smoking environment.

    <notes>*** With every sale we donate a percentage to the Veterans Support Foundation (including this sale). ***
Wargame Depot has donated over $8,000 to this wonderful cause thanks, largely, to the wonderful Boardgamegeek community. Thank you so much for your continued support of Wargame Depot which has allowed us to give generously to the VSF.
Mint, in shrink copy available.  No dings, no dents, or anything wrong with the game.  Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so a purchase from me will always be packed professionally and I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
And if you want this game plus anything else that I am selling on BGG, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course be happy to add other items on in order to save you on shipping!
North Carolina residents pay 7% sales tax.
Cheers,
Jason
PS:  We have many Osprey books in stock not listed on BGG.  The prices are well under publisher rates; if you are interested in them, please let me know!</notes>
