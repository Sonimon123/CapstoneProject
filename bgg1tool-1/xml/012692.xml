   <description>The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Gloom: 
The Game of Inauspicious Incidents 
and Grave Consequences 
The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any worse, they do. But some say that one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond. 
In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins. 
Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got to see (through) this game to believe it! 
For 2 to 4 players, ages 8 and up. </notes>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition.  The cards are mint, but the seal on the box has come loose.  I can recommend getting a card box for this set, as they fit perfectly and it’s much better storage than the factory box.  I’m also selling the Unhappy Homes expansion as well, so please check it out!  Shipping within the USA will be $3.99, and if you buy the expansion as well I’ll ship together to save on shipping costs.  Please contact me for international shipping.
Many thanks for your business!</notes>

    <notes>*Includes base game plus Unwelcome Guests expansion*
The listed price is to buy both games.  (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed the pair under both the base game and the expansion.)
The box to the base game is in good condition, with wear at the joints.  The box for Unwelcome Guests is in very good condition.  The cards and rulebook are in good condition.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like, I can send you an extra copy of half of the cards from the base game.  However, these extra cards are blurry, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really recommend them.  (I bought the first printing of the game, and Atlas sent me a legible replacement for the one deck which was misprinted.) 
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

Gloom: 
The Game of Inauspicious Incidents 
and Grave Consequences 
The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any worse, they do. But some say that one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond. 
In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins. 
Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got to see (through) this game to believe it! </notes>

The Game of Inauspicious Incidents and Grave Consequences! The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any worse, they do. But some say that one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond. In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins. Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got to see (through) this game to believe it! </notes>

I only ship via USPS Priority Mail, and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay the actual shipping cost. Should be pretty cheap (in the US anyway) since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a small box!</notes>

Please do not purchase if you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t win this auction.
- Games are shipped via USPS Priority Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise, at which point we can discuss shipping. 
- I exclusively use PayPal and PayPal invoices. Please do not pay me until I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sent you an invoice. 
This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail. </notes>
