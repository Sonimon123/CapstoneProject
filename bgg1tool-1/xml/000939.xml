   <description>Based on the four battles at the end of Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace -- the battle on the plain between the Gungan forces and the droid army; the attempt by Naboo forces, led by Queen Amidala, to storm the palace and capture the Trade Federation viceroys; the fight between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights; and the space battle in which Anakin's starfighter destroyed the Droid Control Ship._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The forces are represented by 155 plastic miniatures on three separate boards, including a three-level palace.  The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side.  Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order.  The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides.  Combat is resolved using special attack and defense dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a brand new, still in shrink copy of Star Wars--The Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Gambit.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship anywhere (due to the fact that the buyer pays shipping ; ) ). If you live outside the USA, please suggest a shipping company that you like.
PayPal is great, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship it same or next day after I receive it. Checks and money orders are okay as well, but I have to wait for them to clear before shipping. I estimate that shipping costs to US locations should be about $13 for USPS priority mail.</notes>

    <notes>Game is out of print and still in shrink.
Warning - this game is too heavy to ship in an up to 2 kg surface package. So shipping migh be quite costly depending on destination.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.</notes>

Contents punched and played once or twice, but complete and in excellent condition.  Box is also in excellent structural condition, marred only by a small dent in one corner and minor shelfwear on bottom and back side.
Downgraded to Acceptable due to some figures being stained by the bleeding-red color from other figures.  Normally this would not affect gameplay; however, some of the green damage counters were stained, one of which is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;secret_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Queen Amadala counter.  These would need to be cleaned or painted over to match the others.</notes>

    <notes>The game is missing one (of 12) Destroyer Droids. All 12 are needed upon game setup and so a proxy will be required until the first one is destroyed. Otherwise the game is complete and in excellent condition.
I will ship anywhere but costs will be reasonable (~$16) to Canada, expensive (~$26) to the US and outrageous (~$58) anywhere else. (Actual shipping charges will be whatever Canada Post charges.) </notes>

    <notes>I love this game but I am a graduate student with four mouths to feed and have to part with some cherished... _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;ahem_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;members_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of the family.
Game is complete, no smoke no pets.  Minor shelf wear would be the only issue, if at all.  
Shipping:
I will only ship to Europe if BUYER agrees to pay for ALL shipping costs (sorry).  I will pay first $15 for US shipping, buyer pays the remainder.
Payment:
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind if you pay by check but I will need to wait for the check to clear before I ship the game.
Other than that, drop me a line if you want.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ask me your questions buyer, I am not afraid!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;

    <notes>Item Name: Star Wars The Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Gambit
Description: Star Wars The Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Gambit from Hasbro. Game is missing one (of 65) battle droid, but has an extra multi troop transport, armored attack tank, catapult, green damage counter, anakin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ship stand, and go first marker. Game is in used, but good condition with minor box wear and the board all in good shape.
Shipping Weight: 7 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in almost perfect shape! I found this AWESOME game at a flea market and already own it. The game is in almost perfect condition and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it was ever played. It is missing one piece which is the small Anakin ship...but all the other hundreds of pieces are accounted for including about 20 extra pieces. </notes>

Only one blemish on the entire box. (No shelf wear noticeable, box integrity excellent / no warping, etc...)  The single blemish is a 4mm wide by 5cm long scuff on the lower right corner on the front of the box.  (The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;scuff_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is only on the exterior paper _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wrap_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of the box, revealing the (basically unharmed)cardboard underneath... thus no box integrity compromised...
Willing to ship anywhere, but shipping paid by buyer. (No _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;handling fees_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; though...)</notes>

    <notes>More than complete -- comes with all game components plus a bag of random spare figures!  Most game boards are warped to some extent, and some of the lighter figures have picked up some dye from some of the darker figures.  Neither of these issues affects game play at all.  All remaining game components are in excellent condition.
Box is structurally intact but has a serious smush on one corner.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling a used copy of the Star Wars Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Gambit Board Game. All the pieces, including the extra ones, are included. The cards, boards, instructions, and pieces are all in great condition. The corners of the box are slightly worn but nothing glaring. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d say considering the game is over ten years old it is in pristine shape because it has only been played a few times. 
Game comes from a smoke-free, pet-free home.

    <notes>A solid, complete copy of the game that I have double-verified all component totals against the amounts shown in the included rule book.  The cards, boards, rules, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there, and then some, as you can see listed below.  The box lid has minor cosmetic damage, but rule book, boards, and miniatures are all in great shape.  I have several pictures I can e-mail you if interested.  Only issue I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve noted with the game is one of the Theed Palace cards has a slight crease off to the side, but it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect our gameplay at all.  This is a really neat game that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been holding onto for several years but our other hobbies (fishing and boating) have taken the center stage for the time being.  
The Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Gambit came with a huge amount of components, but this copy came with many extra miniatures, as listed below.  Along with those extras, I am also including two laminated player aid sheets that I downloaded from BGG that helps speed play up if you are not familiar with the game.
Extra miniatures included:
1 extra Multi-troop Transport (4 total)
1 extra Battle Droid (66 total)
1 extra Catapult (4 total)
1 extra Captain Panaka (2 total)
2 extra Viceroy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s (4 total)
1 extra Naboo Fighter stand (note, an extra stand only, not an extra ship) (2 total)
1 extra 1st player marker (2 total)
1 extra Armored Attack Tank (5 total)
1 extra Fambas (3 total)
2 extra green counters (11 total)
1 extra Destroyer Droid (13 total)
1 extra Gungan (28 total)
1 extra Palace Guard (22 total)</notes>

    <notes>The lid shows some bubbling probably because the box itself feels weak and not very well made. Given the price point, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to take some pictures and send them to you if you are interested in the game.
Components are used, cards show a little wear but nothing is marked or missing. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve looked over the figures and everything seems alright. Some of the gungan pieces are a little soft but I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just the kind of plastic used to make them.
Shipping world wide is crazy expensive. Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask what shipping is to your country unless you are going to be ok with the answer being around 80 bucks. Might be cheaper, but expect it to suck.</notes>
