Blood and Bridges is a complete stand-alone World at War module that depicts the struggle for control of the bridges in the Rhine River Valley. Fresh Guards units are spearheading the assault into Western Europe, bending defending NATO forces to their breaking point. It is up to forces of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), to stop the Soviet advance which, if successful could ultimately threaten Britain itself.
This stand-alone expansion to the Award Winning World at War: Eisenbach Gap System, contains everything you need to play right out of the box. A new, fully updated and expanded rulebook covers the entire original World at War rules and adds new rules to expand the on-map action. Included are regulations for bridging units like Soviet MTU-55, improved positions and air power, which was a special scenario rule in Death of the First Panzer (An earlier add-on covering West German forces with an 11x17 map, 40 new scuff-resistant counters, and 6 new scenarios). Now the NATO forces will have improved positions to help them cope with the Soviet onslaught. Air power becomes an official game element, with rules and counters representing American A-10_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, Soviet SU-25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, and British Tornado_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s. Birds that can deal out a massive amount of destruction on the battlefield, and look sexy doing it. At least as sexy as a cardboard chit can look. Also, expanded artillery rules, introduce Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), and electronic warfare.
In addition a new table brings battlefield chaos effects to the game. War never goes as planned and great leaders must deal with adversity when it happens. So we thought, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shake things up a bit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. In games with this option, if you draw the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;battlefield chaos_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counter, a roll is made to see what the gods of war have hefted upon you, your enemy, or both of you. Anything from bad weather, extra support missions, shell-shocked troops, or skillful battle plans, can come your way.
The war is raging on and now it is up to the British and their formidable array of weapons systems to blunt the Soviet spearhead. Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong with top-of-the-line Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridge layers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft and many more. There is only one mission here. Hold the bridges or see Soviet armor on Channel coast. Are you up to the task?
World at War: Blood and Bridges is the latest complete game in the World at War series. It features 352 counters (we just added an extra half sheet of admin counter goodness), a mounted 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map, 12 scenarios, two player-aid cards, dice, and a complete rules set.

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage will normally be by Royal Mail standard parcels within the UK unless otherwise agreed with a charge of £4.41 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £4.99. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
There is the option of first class post and courier may be available for large orders.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.
Barry

    <notes>Lock _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;N Load Publishing (LLP4003)
The war is raging on and now it is up to the British and their formidable array of weapons systems to blunt the Soviet spearhead. Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong into first rate Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridge layers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft and many more. There is only one mission here. Hold the bridges or see Soviet armor on Channel coast. Are you up to the task? Units activate by formation chit drawn, fire in a flurry of dice, and look good doing it. The initial game rules cover self-propelled mortars, thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons, ranged combat, opportunity fire, ATGM depletion, assaults, helicopters, chemical attacks, dual purpose conventional munitions, smoke, HE, opportunity fire, simple line of sight (bit more complex for helicopters), transporting infantry and overruns (great fun). This expansion updates those rules and brings to the table new opportunities including Bridging, Improved Positions, Airstrikes and Air Cover, Jamming, Battlefield Chaos, gun launched ATGMs, MLRS Strikes and others. Better still, World at War: Blood and Bridges is not just a game, but part of the World at War game system. After learning the rules of this standalone expansion, you can play any of the modules and the original Eisenbach Gap. </notes>
