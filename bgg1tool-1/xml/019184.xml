   <description>Lectio (previously known as Lexio) is based on the traditional Chinese game system of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Zheng Shangyou_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the climbing game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and is virtually the same game as Big Two (also known as Chinese Poker). Many other card games are based on the same mechanism (The Great Dalmuti, Gang of Four, Tichu, etc.), but Lectio uses tiles similar to those in Mah Jong instead of cards, and they are of excellent construction. In accordance with Chinese tradition, the number _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is the strongest number. The suits are named after the sun, the moon, the stars, and the wind._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, a player leads a tile or set of tiles, and the other players must follow by either playing a higher tile or set of tiles or passing. The play continues until all players have passed in succession after the final play, and the player who played the last set leads next. Play continues until one player has played all of his tiles. Then each player pays chips to those players who performed better _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; that is, the player who went out will get paid by all other players, and the other players pay points to one another based on the difference in the number of tiles each held at the end of the hand. A game lasts five rounds, and the player at the end of the game with the most points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Combined shipping available on multiple purchases so check out my other items for sale.
I ship via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation were possible. I only charge you what it costs me to ship the game and I will try to ship without flat rate shipping where weight and distance would result in a lower price. For international shipping there may be some restrictions on where I will ship to. Please contact me before purchasing. </notes>

All shipping is done via DHL. Shipping costs depend on size and weight of the parcel and destination. 
Payment:
Within EU I prefer the EU-standard-bank-tranfer (SEPA,IBAN/BIC). It is fast and causes no fees.
Outside EU Paypal and bank-transfer are possible.</notes>

    <notes>Lectio - New White Edition
Box is open (came that way) but tiles still in shrink. 
Game will be packed with care. 
Buyer pays actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred. International buyers cover insurance (usually only $2-3 extra) to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>A rare chance to get hold of this lovely looking game.  The condition is really _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but as the game is a decade old .. :)
Offers considered.
UK postage £6.  
Please note the tiles are chunky and therefore the game is heavy.  There is little point in requesting shipping outside of the UK unless you are willing to pay circa £50 for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Buyer pays shipping of $13.00 in the Continental US.
As for the money chips, there are 23 yellow, 24 red and 20 green.  This means the game is missing one red money chip.  All players starts with 5 red, so in a 5-player game, there will be one missing red.  (However, I will say, while the components are generally great, these chips are awful and would do well to be replaced with poker chips.)   Also, there is no bag.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know what bag they are talking about either. I have the black edition, and it has no bag.  I read something about a travel bag, so maybe that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what they mean?  But anyway, this is the Dagoy White 2005 edition.
 
Otherwise, unplayed and new.</notes>
