The Battle for Normandy is a game that represents the climactic campaign in Normandy from D-Day, 6 June 1944 to the first week of August 1944 at primarily battalion level. Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams. 
The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel. 
 The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved. Scenarios include: (As of March 11, 2008 - we are working on a couple more):  
Campaign : 5 maps, 6 June - 10 Aug
Bloody Omaha : part of one map, 6 June - 10 June
Cobra : 2 maps (most of play on one though), 25 July - 31 July
Goodwood _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cobra (combined): 4 maps, 18 July - 31 July 
Operation Epsom : 1 map, 26 June - 1 July
The Battle for Cherbourg : 1 map, 18 June - 27 June

He passed away in 2012, and the time has come for me to start selling games.  Please keep in mind that not all games on his list are for sale, but feel free to ask me about any of them.  Thank you

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT0912)
The Battle for Normandy is a game that represents the climactic campaign in Normandy from D-Day, 6 June 1944 to the first week of August 1944 at primarily battalion level. Numerous scenarios are included to play out various smaller battles in Normandy. It is intended for two players or player teams. The game uses a unique sequence of play and a system of fire combat throughout the airdrop and beach assault phases with company-level breakdown units, then a more traditional odds-type combat approach throughout the rest of the game. Initial beach defense deployments at start and daily air support and defense allocations, hidden to the opposing player; create a level of uncertainty that makes for a tense, challenging duel. The game combines a detailed, extensively researched order of battle with relatively fast-playing game mechanics to make it not only the largest representation of the Normandy campaign available to date, but a manageable one that is meant to be played, not shelved.</notes>
