   <description>The rules of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Red_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; are simple: highest card wins! But _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Red_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is just one of seven games you'll be playing in Red7, and if you're not winning the current game at the end of your turn, you're out! The last person standing wins the round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The deck in Red7 is 49 cards: each of the colors of the rainbow numbered 1 to 7.

The Rules? - Simple. Win condition? - Easy peasy, just have the best card. The Strategy though...that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a completely different story. Every turn you take could be your last. New from the brilliant minds of Carl Chudyk and Chris Cieslik. 49 cards are numbered from 1 to 7, and feature the seven colors of the rainbow (ROYGBIV). Each set of colors has the unique ability to change the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s current rule set to make a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hand the current winner. The cards are labeled with unique iconography that allow the game to be color-blind friendly. Red7 is easy to teach, quick to learn, and fun for all skill levels of card game players.</notes>

    <notes>Asmadi Games (ASN0050)
The Rules? - Simple. Win condition? - Easy peasy, just have the best card. The Strategy though...that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a completely different story. Every turn you take could be your last. New from the brilliant minds of Carl Chudyk and Chris Cieslik. 49 cards are numbered from 1 to 7, and feature the seven colors of the rainbow (ROYGBIV). Each set of colors has the unique ability to change the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s current rule set to make a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hand the current winner. The cards are labeled with unique iconography that allow the game to be color-blind friendly. Red7 is easy to teach, quick to learn, and fun for all skill levels of card game players.</notes>
