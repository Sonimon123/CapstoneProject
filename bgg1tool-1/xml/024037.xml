   <description>An island made up of 37 hex-shaped plastic tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board).  Each player controls 12 Atlantean Tribesmen that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island sinks.  Players can either swim, latch onto a dolphin, or use boats to travel but must avoid sea monsters, octopuses, and sharks on their way to safety._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Escape from Atlantis is similar to the Parker Brothers game Survive! but with some key differences (e.g., people pawns are not worth a variable number of points)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2010, a reworked version of Escape from Atlantis which combines the rules of the game along with the rules to Survive! was printed by Stronghold Games titled _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Survive: Escape from Atlantis!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Waddington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s classic 1986 English first edition with brightly painted wooden people (meeples) and 3D atlantis pieces. Everything in mint condition, and hardly played, considering its age.
(far prettier disney-like wave artwork than recent bland 3D _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;reimagining_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; IMHO!)

This is the version with brightly coloured miniatures for the atlanteans and lovely, bright plastic 3D creatures (the disney-like waves across the board is far prettier than the new bland wooden one with dull CGI board art IMHO).
grab a bargain and a classic game!

    <notes>Bought used, played once, put away. Has the charity shop sticker on the box (Barnados!), some wear and creasing on the box, otherwise in very good condition, no splits, no tears, no sellotape. No inlay in the box, the components are all bagged by me but slide around (don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if the game came with an inlay). Contents in perfect condition.
In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played.
English rules.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
Can ship quickly in the UK cheaply by courier.
Can ship quickish to the EU by Royal Mail
Can ship slowly by sea to the USA/Canada by Royal Mail cheaply. If you want airmail, that costs.
Other locations will research when I get an order.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
If you make the Paypal payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If you make the Paypal payment as a commercial transaction, I get charged near 4% of the payment because you get protection in a dispute. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously.</notes>
