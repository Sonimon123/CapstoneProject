   <description>International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Simulating the Pacific Front of World War II has always been one of the great wargame design challenges. The same distance that planes could cover in a few hours took days for ships and weeks for foot soldiers. Hostile jungles and great oceans combined to make logistics and transport of paramount historical concerns. These and other design puzzles are solvable by only the most gifted designers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Renowned Japanese wargame designer Tetsuya Nakamura has successfully met these challenges and Multi-Man Publishing is to offer the elegant result - Fire in the Sky. Fire in the Sky has, until now, only been available in Japanese._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With only one map and 180 counters, Fire in the Sky packs years of prior Pacific design attempts and experience into an effort that beautifully distills the essence of the conflict and serves as further proof that great things do indeed come in small packages. Fire in the Sky provides players with the same problems and perspectives faced by the historical combatants, yet does so in a game that can be played in 5 hours or less. The game is ingeniously balanced and so provides not only a look into the minds of the actual commanders, but also a fun, competitive and tense gaming experience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game includes glorious 1-inch counters, a clever map that integrates hexes and areas, and rules that cover all of the essential aspects of the Great Pacific War. Oil convoys and troop transports are as vital to victory as the massive Carrier fleets that steam over the vast Pacific. Tetsuya Nakamura_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s intelligent and ingenious design also offers Western players a fascinating glimpse into the Japanese perspective on the war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Complete and in excellent condition. Box shows a small amount of creasing on the front, and some edge and corner wear. Map is in excellent condition with only minor crease wear. Counters are neatly trimmed, sorted, and bagged. One counter (US Air Superiority marker) was lightly damaged during trimming and shows a little ink from touch-up. Otherwise, everything is in excellent or better condition with little sign of wear.
Shipping weight is 2lb, so shipping will be either by USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Box ($9.80), or regular Priority Mail if you live close enough to CA for that to be cheaper.</notes>

Shipping is by priority mail, either flat rate ($11.35) or by distance, whichever is cheaper for you--so maximum CONUS postage for this item will be $11.35. Canadians may pay more. You pay extra for insurance and whatnot. Just let me know when you buy and I will add that in to the shipping cost.</notes>

Please contact me for shipping costs if you live outside the UK.
Shipping in the UK is GBP 11.22, recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.
I pack very safely and securely.

    <notes>This game has had the shrink wrap removed but is un-punched and 100% complete.
The interior contents are new for all practical purposes.
The box, however, has a few minor dents and light shelf-wear. There is also a small mark/stain of some sort on the bottom edge of the box. But even so, the box is still strong and makes a good appearance overall.  </notes>

Please contact me for shipping costs if you live outside the UK.
Shipping in the UK is GBP 11.22, recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.
I pack very safely and securely.

My late husband was an avid board game collector.  It is time for the games to find new homes, hopefully to someone who enjoys them as much as he did.  All his games are in excellent condition, he took very good care of them.   If he did play the games, no eating or drinking was allowed.  
Please feel free to ask any questions.   Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Punched and played twice, but in great condition and all pieces accounted for. Because the map is laminated (I laminate all maps after a notorious flooding problem  two decades ago) and requires a tube to ship in, the game will come in two packages. I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t edit the settings, but I will cover the shipping, so the $100 includes everything, as long as it is to the lower 48 states (sorry Alaska and Hawaii!).</notes>

    <notes>Buyer pays shipping from Toronto Canada.
Very few plays. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in overall excellent condition with all components complete. Charts and player aids have been laminated. Counters have a protective layer on them. Map has been laminated. Basically, this game should be able weather tons and tons of plays. Rules are intact, no highlighting, no yellowing or other kinds of notes. Counter tray is included in the box.
Please note that with a laminated map which I would have to ship that component in a tube. However both the game box and map would be shipped together to cut costs. I estimate $28 USD for continental US addresses, but that was based on mostly US north east codes postal codes, not sure how much of  difference it would make if sent elsewhere in the US. Canada will likely be cheaper (I will still quote in USD though). 
Outside of North America shipping costs may well match or exceed the sale price, though I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to consider a $10 discount in such a scenario (I would update the price upon agreeing to a sale).</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Punched but unplayed. Box has very light shelf wear but could easily pass as off the store shelf new stock. Counters are unplayed, unworn, and in excellent condition. Rule book, map, and all other original content in like new condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Punched, clipped and counters in plastic ziplog bags. The game was never played. The game is not huge nor weights a ton, so it is relatively cheap to send it abroad.
Buyer pays shipping. Paypal is OK, but I prefer bank transfer if you are in Europe. I could keep this one under 1 kg with packaging and protective stuff, but if I ask for more money than it costs at the end, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refund the difference via Paypal as a gift.
Orientative shipping, so you have an idea:
España (Ordinary 4.67€ / Certified 7.17€); Europe (Ord. 12.60€ / Cert. 15.45€); USA (around 22€ with tracking, but I have to check first)
***
Todas las fichas están separadas de las hojas y repartidas en bolsitas. Por lo demás el juego está intacto.
El pago en España y Europa sería por transferencia o ingreso bancario.
El envío se realizaría por Correos y el gasto corre a cargo del comprador. Son 4,67€ por correo ordinario y 7,17€ por correo certificado. El envío por Kiala (kiala.es) es otra opción más económica (5€ hasta 8 Kg) y cómoda que dependerá del comprador.</notes>

    <notes>Buyer to pay shipping, USPS medium flat rate box @ $13.60.  The game is unpunched, kept in a smoke-free home, no split corners on the box.  This includes a spiral bound updated rules set, rules summaries, play aids, etc. from the web.  Errata/FAQ included as well, basically the game is updated and ready to punch and play, just never found time to get this to the table, hoping someone else might.</notes>

Shipping costs extra. Shipping from Maryland (21146). Will ship worldwide but note that it will be expensive (better to have someone receive it for you in the U.S.)
Shipping costs can be combined if you purchase other items that I am selling.
PayPal for payment. USPS for shipment.
If you are outside the U.S., please add 2 percent of the total (to include shipping costs) to cover the extra PayPal fees.</notes>
