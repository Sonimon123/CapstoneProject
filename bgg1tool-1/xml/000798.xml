   <description>Ace of Aces is an innovative 1-on-1 combat game that simulates a dogfight between WWI aircraft. Each player has a book with pictures of what they see out the cockpit of their airplane. Each player selects a maneuver (bank left, barrel roll, etc.) and tells their opponent a page number to turn to. This new page, when cross indexed with the maneuver made, gives the page number that shows the results of the chosen maneuver. The object of the game is to get your opponent in your sights and shoot them down._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are advanced rules for fuel consumption as well as a campaign game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a used version of the WWI Air Combat Game, Ace of Aces.  It is the Handy Rotary Series, but I am unsure if it is the earlier or later edition.  It does not have the original slip cover, they are the books only.  Someone who is looking for a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version of this game NEEDS TO LOOK ELSEWHERE, but if you simply want this game, mine will do just fine.  The edges of the books are dirtied, but there are no tears on any pages, therefore it is playable.  Please note that shipping to places outside the United States will be $10.00.  </notes>

    <notes>Like New! - As received from the original publisher, before it was shipped with a game box.  These two books are in beautiful condition.  No damage of any kind to report, and no smoke smell to them either.
This game ships for FREE when ordered with any of my other items here on BGG (excluding games with this same offer, of course).
I can accept Paypal if necessary.  Please add 5% to your total if you wish to use this service.  Other payment methods are available as well.</notes>

    <notes>All games are complete to the best of my knowledge, if I have any doubt I sell it as pieces.
I am a non-smoker.  The games have been stored in a dry basement in bookshelves. 
I wrap all the games I sell in plastic to prevent damaged. The game come with trays in them, if they came with them or I if added them.
I also professional mailing company’s. They do a good job in packing and insurance. Never had a problem with either them.   Due to some non-payment of items sent, I will only now take PayPal and will have the postage and the game amount paid in full before I send the game
