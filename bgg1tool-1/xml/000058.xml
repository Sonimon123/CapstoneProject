   <description>Kings _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Things is a classic Tom Wham game of warring kingdoms in a fantasy world and the legions of things that inhabit them. The board is made from hex tiles, which allows for a different board layout every time. Utilizing an interesting flipped counter element, players attempt to out bluff one another regarding the types of things they have in their armies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    King of the Tabletop_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I purchased this on Ebay some time ago, so please read the description before you buy.
This is the 1986 West End edition. The box is in acceptable condition, but was apparently stored in direct sunlight for an extended period and is extremely faded. There are also some minor stains on the front (top), though there are no rips or tears, or torn corners. There is considerable shelf wear. The components are in very good condition however. The counters have been punched but all appear to be present (at least when I played recently). They are in very good condition with some wear. The tiles, rules and racks are all in very good condition also. Four 6-sided dice are included.</notes>

    <notes>This is the English West End/Games Workshop version.  This game is in GREAT shape.  Box has very minor cave, little or no shelfwear.  Counters are unpunched, hexes came apart prior to opening so are punched.  Grab this chance to own a steller copy of the English version of this fantastic game.  
Shipping will be for cost, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll supply the box.

    <notes>This is the West End Games (English) version.  It has a few stains on the rulebook.  Box is solid, slightly caved on top.  It is complete except for, I think, one small marker.  The rulebook says 351 and I count 350.  If anyone has an inventory, I could try to sort out which one it is, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t imagine it would effect gameplay.</notes>

    <notes>Games Workshop edition in bookcase box. Punched and bagged. Everything in great shape. Includes 3 additional photocopies of the rules. Box has above average shelf wear and lid is slightly bowed.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $19 to Canada. $26 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>!!Please read my description before you buy!!
I purchased this game used from Noble Knight Games. It is (as best I can tell) complete. I listed it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s actually a tale of 2 conditions. The box is quite shelf worn, with some extremely minor staining, and a bit of dimpling. The components however, are a different story, and a happy one at that. The counters, racks, and terrain tiles are in excellent condition. The manual is somewhat worn, but is in remarkable condition considering it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age.  So while the box is borderline acceptable/good (by my standards), the components are borderline very good/like new.</notes>

Within Euro-zone I do prefer payment via EU-standard-bank-transfer (SEPA, IBAN/BIC) because it has no fees and is quick and safe.
If you want to pay via PAYPAL this will normally be OK, too, but please contact me upfront and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to take over all PAYPAL fees.
