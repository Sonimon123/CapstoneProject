   <description>Fighting ships in the age of sail!  This classic title details military engagements in the golden age of sail with a plethora of historical scenarios.  Players take their groups of ships and form their ship lines and then go at it.  The game comes with a large generic ocean map overlaid with a hex grid.  The ship counters occupy two hexes and include special rules for moving and firing with this design.  Players can begin with the smaller scenarios and work up to whole fleets engaged in pitched battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Wooden Ships _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Iron Men is a well cared for vintage game copyrighted 1975 by Avalon Hill.
Contents to my knowledge are complete, undamaged, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; complete.  Chips are partially punched.  Contents include instructions, game board in 2 sections, the Ship_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Log Pad (from which I think only 1/2 doz sheets used), Advanced Game Tables, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; a die.  
I have rated the game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because the box top has 1 split corner and shelf wear.</notes>

    <notes>This is the complete game, opened and played, in good condition.  It is the Avalon Hill edition of the game, published in 1975.
About half the counters are punched, and all are in very good condition. The rulebook is in good condition, with clean interior pages, but with discoloration and dirt on the cover, and with wear and slight bending to the upper right corner of some pages. A few of the ship’s log pads have been used; the rest are clean. The tables page is slightly discolored. The mapboard is in very good condition with a few light dents from die rolls. It lies flat without difficulty. The box is in fair condition, with a slight bend to its sides, dirt from the price tag, and significant wear on all edges.
The listed shipping price is for USPS Priority Mail -- You can likely save $2  or more if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind using Parcel Post, instead.  Also, note that I do reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount. (I charge an estimate of the actual shipping cost.)</notes>

Map in good condition with no tears. Box in very good condition with very minor shelf wear. It had one split corner but this has been repaired (not with tape). The packaged game weights 3 lbs 4 oz and I charge only exact USPS shipping costs from zip code 21702 (Maryland). If you are unsure of the shipping costs, please geekmail me your zip code and I will give you the exact cost options. I will ship internationally if you are willing to pay the costs and assume responsibility for any loss although I have never had any problems before shipping internationally. I can provide photos if you want. Any other questions please ask.</notes>

    <notes>Very good condition. All pieces accounted for (map in two pieces, ship_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s log pad, advanced game tables, counter sheet, one six sided die, and box. Box has normal shelf wear for a game published almost 40 years ago; corners are tapes on two sides). Most counters are unpunched.

    <notes>Punched and bagged.
All components in near new condition. Does not look to have been played. Box has average shelf wear but no damage.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

1975 Avalon Hill.  1st ed near as I can tell.  Box in poor shape: all corners split and taped, heavy edge wear, age discoloration.
All components present; plenty of blank log pads; a couple of variants printed from the web.
2 units loose and bagged, balance unpunched.
Rules have some handling wear; maps VG.

    <notes>Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 1981 second edition.
All parts are present, but I have used eighteen out of the thirty original pages of the Log Chart; nevertheless, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s easy enough to print or photocopy more logs if you use up the remaining twelve. Some wear on the board, bits and tables. Some items on tables circled in pencil, and my name is written (in small letters!) on the rule book and Combat Results Table. A few of the counters also have the name of that ship on the underside. The box has a fair bit of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;shelf wear_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on it, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all in one piece, and there are no tears at the corners.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to accept payment in either Canadian or American dollars, whichever is most convenient for you.</notes>

    <notes>Complete, unpunched, unblemished, zero wear and tear, all components completely unused. The box is very slightly yellowing with age, but is basically unblemished. Incredible for a 30+ year old box.
The rule book is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fixed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version with the center pages in place.
I am unsure that all the components come from the same print run, and have no way to check, which is why I rated this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. This copy has been opened and perused, and has been owned by more than one person. I can say for sure is that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a complete copy with all the components in unused condition, but it may not be precisely like it just came out of the shrinkwrap.</notes>

    <notes>200th Anniv Edition.  Still sealed in shrink wrap, but one section of shrink wrap top right corner has torn away a bit. 
Box may have a slight yellowing and musty smell from basement storage. Salvaged from a lot of games I bought at an estate sale. 
Best of the lot.  Postage extra. Thanks all.</notes>
