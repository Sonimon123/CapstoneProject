   <description>Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A brief description from the rule book:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ships at landings that are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;complete_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing.

Age of players: 12++
Length: 60-120 minutes
Game Description: 
The search for a viable route to India was, since the mid-15th Century, the main goal of almost
all expeditions made by the Portuguese Kingdom.
In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and Pedro da Covilha found a
land route, but it was only in 1498 that Vasco da Gama reached the goal and became the first
European to reach, after some stops along the way, the legendary Calicut by sea. Vasco da Gama accomplished something exceptional, granting Portugal the possibility to achieve a monopoly on the spice trade between India and Europe.
Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India. Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build Ships, launch them and send them to the Landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa and Calicut. For each Ship sent, Players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). The further the Ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the Player will earn. Ships at Landings that are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;complete_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; at the end of the Round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.
During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, Purchase Projects or Characters). Planning is fundamental: The right to take an action could be free
of charge or paid for.
The earlier a Player plans to take an action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.
Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area. Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge
action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them. This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters. Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players. Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points; Manuel I (The King) will allow Players to take an additional action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.

The search for a viable route to India was, since the mid-15th Century, the main goal of almost
all expeditions made by the Portuguese Kingdom.
In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and Pedro da Covilha found a
land route, but it was only in 1498 that Vasco da Gama reached the goal and became the first
European to reach, after some stops along the way, the legendary Calicut by sea. Vasco da Gama accomplished something exceptional, granting Portugal the possibility to achieve a monopoly on the spice trade between India and Europe.
Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India. Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build Ships, launch them and send them to the Landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa and Calicut. For each Ship sent, Players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). The further the Ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the Player will earn. Ships at Landings that are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;complete_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; at the end of the Round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.
During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, Purchase Projects or Characters). Planning is fundamental: The right to take an action could be free
of charge or paid for.
The earlier a Player plans to take an action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.
Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area. Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge
action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them. This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters. Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players. Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points; Manuel I (The King) will allow Players to take an additional action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 405)
The search for a viable route to India was, since the mid-15th Century, the main goal of almost all expeditions made by the Portuguese Kingdom.  In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and Pedro da Covilha found a land route, but it was only in 1498 that Vasco da Gama reached the goal and became the first European to reach, after some stops along the way, the legendary Calicut by sea. Vasco da Gama accomplished something exceptional, granting Portugal the possibility to achieve a monopoly on the spice trade between India and Europe.
Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India. Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build Ships, launch them and send them to the Landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa and Calicut. For each Ship sent, Players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). The further the Ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the Player will earn. Ships at Landings that are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;complete_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; at the end of the Round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.
During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, Purchase Projects or Characters). Planning is fundamental: The right to take an action could be free of charge or paid for.
The earlier a Player plans to take an action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.
Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area. Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them. This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters. Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players. Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points; Manuel I (The King) will allow Players to take an additional action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.</notes>

    <notes>Never played, absolutely pristine condition, except the box bottom is slightly dented in (was that way in the shrink unfortunately). 
Optional Plano case (see photo) included if you want to pay $5 extra (I will ask when I send you the final price). It fits nicely into the box and holds many of the components. Otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll transfer those components to a baggie.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is a fixed $11.35. International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.

    <notes>Game is sealed but has a crease going along the width (a couple inches) of one side of the box from being pressed inward.  This also caused a crease along the back of the box.  Looking at the front you wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know anything is wrong at all, but please note this is considered a ding and dent purchase.  
Shipping is $13.65 priority flat rate medium box.</notes>
