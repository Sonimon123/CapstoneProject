Contact me for shipping, but US rates should be about $10. (Given the weight, the Priority Mail Flat Rate box is going to the be the best option.) Shipping rates outside the US will be significantly higher, because of the higher cost of international shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Illuminati: New World Order is the collectible card game version of Steve Jackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s classic game of secret society_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and covert world domination. This copy for sale is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;One With Everything_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; factory set that includes every card in the first release of the game. (Over 430 cards!) It does not include the 20 blank cards that came with this set and one card (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;First thing we do..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) has bent corners. Otherwise it is complete and in very good condition.
Also included are 101 cards from the Assassins expansion. (E-mail me if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like a list of these.) </notes>

    <notes>See condition notes before buying (summary: cards like new, boxes acceptable).
This is for two rare and out of print items from the 1995 Steve Jackson Games collectible card game Illuminati. Both items have been opened and used twice. Boxes are worn but intact, contents are in near-mint (excellent, unworn) condition (unworn, unbent).
   1. Illuminati New World Order One With Everything Factory Set
   2. Illuminati New World Order Unlimited Edition Starter Set
1. Factory Set:
    * Contains one each of every Common, Uncommon, and Rare card from Illuminati New World Order
    * One each of the Pyramid and The Duelist special cards
    * 3 each of the nine Illuminatis (main group cards)
    * 10 blank Group and 10 blank Plot cards
    * Total of 450 cards in original box. Box condition is scuffed at edges (see picture) and corners with a crack at bottom but is still strong and holds together.
2. Unlimited Edition Starter Set
    * Over 50 Illuminati trading cards in excellent condition.
    * In original box, which has been opened and is worn at edges and corners, creased at front bottom, but intact.
Why am I selling?
I am the original owner of this set. I bought it at a closeout at a comic book shop in Flushing, NY about ten years ago and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve used it just twice. I am past ready liquidate it for its value.
Payments accepted/shipping:
You can pay via paypal and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll eat their fee. Americans can also send a check if you prefer but I will not ship until it clears. My addresses to be provided to the buyer.
Shipping: 6$ to the U.S., other countries to be quoted.</notes>

    <notes>This is for two sets of the New World Order decks.  It does not include the boxes (I removed them from the boxes when I bought them and stored them in hard plastic card cases).  It also does not include the instructions (god knows what I was thinking there!) but the complete instructions can be downloaded here:
http://www.sjgames.com/inwo/rules/inwo-rules-12.pdf
The cards themselves were played once at Gen Con the year the game was release and have been in storage ever since.  So while the box and instructions are missing, the cards are basically new.
Shipping will be, at most, my exact cost.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t pad my price with handling charges.

    <notes>For BGG user khues only.
Compared with the inventory in the document below, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there. 
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/11291/illuminatidoc
The only differences are what you would expect: 
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the Starter Set Box stuff listed at the end (since this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a starter set).
I have 20 blank cards (10 with the red back and 10 with the blue back).
I have 3 of each Illuminati card.
I have the World Domination Handbook and a big page about the One With Everything set.
In terms of condition, the box has some wear, but the cards and rules look new. I think we actually played the game only twice and looked at the cards once or twice in addition to that.  
images documenting condition are here:
