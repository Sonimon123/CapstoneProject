   <description>In Cathedral, each player has a set of pieces of a different color. The pieces are in the shapes of buildings, covering from one to five square units. The first player takes the single neutral Cathedral piece and places it onto the board. Players then alternate placing one of their buildings onto the board until neither player can place another building. Players capture territory by surrounding areas that are occupied by at most one opponent or neutral building. A captured piece is removed and captured territory becomes off-limits to the opponent. The player with the fewest 'square units' of buildings that can't be placed wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I have rated this as very good because of the condition of the box. The box shows significant shelf wear and there are a couple of small tears in the paper. The corners are intact. The contents are brand new. The wooden pieces and board have never been out of their plastic. This is a wooden edition from Family Games. Instructions are included (they are underneath in the plastic case that the wooden board and pieces are sealed in) but not pictured.
Shipping will be via USPS Parcel Post (unless Priority is requested) based on actual distance and weight.  </notes>

    <notes>I believe this copy is from the third edition run, published by Family Games Inc. from Quebec.  At any rate, this is the classiest print of the game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen; beautiful blonde and brown wooden pieces, and gothic prints titles on the box.
The box has seen very minor wear, the pieces and board are all in great shape.  I live in Portland, OR if you want to avoid shipping costs.  Otherwise, due to the weight of all that wood, the shipping will likely be $11.35 flat rate to anywhere is the United States.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Cathedral
Description: Cathedral used, complete. Box has wear, but components are all in great shape as is the instruction booklet. This is the Mattel version with red/gray plastic pieces.
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>All pieces present and correct.  This is the wooden version of the game.  The box has some damage including a tear to one corner, but the pieces are all in excellent condition.  Non-smoking household.
Also I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve made one modification to the set. Originally, the cathedral was painted grey, while the rest of the set was natural wood. I sanded off the grey and varnished the cathedral. I think it looks a lot nicer, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s obviously not original any more.

    <notes>The all-plastic game components are in very good to like new condition.  The box shows moderate wear and is structurally sound.  The original rules have been replaced with printed out rules from the BGG website.  The box is too large for medium flat rate shipping - expect shipping to be in the $14 - $17 range, depending on location.</notes>
