   <description>Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;epochs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the Box:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

    <notes>Alea/Rio Grande Games edition. In excellent shape. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re missing Alea game #1 on your shelf, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your chance.
One minor caveat: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve replaced the Ra figure and wooden bidding tiles from this game with those from the Uberplay version. The Ra figure is identical to the Alea version, and the bidding _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;sun tiles_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; look the same, but are a tad lighter. Still, very nice material.

I accept PayPal transfers. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t accept PayPal credit card payments. For international orders PayPal transfers (not credit cards) are strongly preferred but I will accept checks in USD drawn on a US bank. There may be additional shipping delays for international orders paid by check as I wait for the check to clear.
Buyer pays actual shipping charges for US addresses. International orders will incur a $2 handling fee. I will ship game within 1 business day of receiving payment, unless payment is by personal check. Personal checks will delay shipping by upto 7-10 business days after check arrives. I will combine shipping on multiple orders to lower overall shipping charges.

    <notes>UberPlay Entertainment (UBR 129)
Ra is an auction game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase three lots of tiles with their bidding tiles. Once a player has purchased his three lots for the round, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The tiles give either immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three epochs. The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.</notes>

    <notes>UberPlay Entertainment (UBR 129)
Ra is an auction game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase three lots of tiles with their bidding tiles. Once a player has purchased his three lots for the round, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The tiles give either immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three epochs. The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games - Ra
Language: English
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 12+
Duration: about 60 min
Weight: 1,090 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Ra is an auction game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase three lots of tiles with their bidding tiles. Once a player has purchased his three lots for the round, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The tiles give either immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three epochs. The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.

    <notes>This is the Alea/RGG version (Alea big box, Englsih language) and looks great next to all those other Alea big boxes. Punched but pristine. You know, that shelf you have that is just missing number _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. This is it. Three cheers for RA!
Buyer to pay actual USPS Priority shipping. Personal checks must clear prior to shipment.

Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

Using these limited tokens, players must decide when to bid and how much to get the tiles they want.

You pay all shipping charges. For domestic shipping, this game can be shipped inside a medium Priority Mail flat rate box for $11.00.  This method also does not include insurance, which can be added for $1.75. I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged shipments if you do not purchase insurance.
Please note that the Priority Mail flat rate box does not allow for much padding, so if you are concerned about damage during shipment you may want to have it shipped by another method. I will ship by any carrier you prefer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping for multiple items. I have quite a few games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling, but it is taking me a while to list them, so e-mail me for a complete list. Use zip code 98104 to calculate shipping costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to arrange for local pickup in the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia area.
I will ship anywhere, by your choice of carrier, however there is a $10 surcharge per international shipments above the cost of shipping to compensate me for the additional time involved in shipping internationally. Note that this is per shipment, so if you buy several games from me and have them shipped together, you just pay once. Sorry to have to do this, but international shipments are much more time consuming for me than domestic shipments.
Payment by PayPall only, except for local pickup which must be paid in cash. Sorry, no checks or money orders.  I will ship within 3 days of receipt of payment.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original Alea version with the #1 on the box edge.  Game is in very good condition, but does have light rubbing wear on the box bottom.  There is also a very light horizontal score on the box front just below the game title. (see photos)
The Alea version is in German, but does have player aids which have been downloaded from the geek.  
Let me know if you have any questions.  Shipping is in a medium flat rate priority box.</notes>

    <notes>One corner is bowed slightly outward.  I can provide a photo if requested, but the damage is so slight that you might not even notice unless you were looking for it.  Box is otherwise in pristine condition and the game is unplayed.  All parts and pieces included.  Just never really got into the theme.
Shipping will be by USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Box unless buyer requests otherwise.  Local pickup accepted in Winter Park, FL.  Contact me for details.  This is the only option for which COD is accepted.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Edition. 
Played only a few times. Ra: The Dice Game has fired Ra from our collection. Ra can play 2, but isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fun since it has an auction mechanic. Ra: The Dice Game sees a ridiculous amount of table time with us so I am parting with Ra so someone else can enjoy this game.

--++ General Information ++--
The item comes from a private collection (non-smoking). If you want pictures of the box or have any question in advance, just send me a geekmail or email to baxel@gmx.at , I will usually respond within 48 hours.
--++ Shipping ++--
Shipping costs depend on the size and weight of the package and the destination. I use the austrian federal postal service (usually the cheapest option).
Estimated shipping costs within EU:
Up to 1kg without insurance: € 14,-
Up to 2kg with insurance: € 15,-
Up to 5kg with insurance: € 18,-
Shipping costs to destinations outside of the EU vary.
--++ Payment ++--
I prefer bank transfer (IBAN/BIC) because it is fast and causes no fees. PayPal is also possible but discouraged.</notes>

Uberplay edition. I played this at Origins many years ago and loved it. Then I bought this and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played it. Cardboard is unpunched. Excellent condition.
My wife doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like auction games so I need to purge this.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO119)
Ra is set in ancient Egypt. The players strive for power by collecting tiles that represent various aspects of economic, spiritual, and technological growth. The players acquire the tiles by bidding for them in auctions. The currency for these auctions are tokens given to players by Ra, the sun God. Using these limited tokens, players must decide when to bid and how much to get the tiles they want. And, yes, the new version will include rules for 2 players. </notes>

All game components in great shape, the 2006 second-edition includes a drawstring bag to ease tile selection.  Rules are a printout only, though. Also, there are initials written ~0.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-tall in ballpoint pen on cover in upper right corner, but non-obtrusively (previous owner).
Shipping is exact cost + $0.50 (shipping materials) via USPS from 53534 (about 2.6 lb).

    <notes>[listitem=4170604]Item[/listitem] for no-ship auction winner landcsf only.  Local payment+pick-up to be arranged via GeekMail.
Full condition description follows:
New in shrink. Two or three corners of the box have had the shrink worn through to the box, presumably due to handling at retailer—there is now the tiniest bit of whitening at these corners.
Additionally, a production error resulted in part of the box-lid paper not fully covering the box on one side of the lid—the paper appears to have tucked under itself, leaving a triangular-shaped portion of the inner cardboard visible.
Lastly, shrink on back of box has a small mark of ink (presumably some kind of colour coding by retailer).</notes>

For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
Three options are available for delivery within the continental United States - local pickup only in the San Jose, California area, USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate, and FedEx Ground. The cost options are:
FedEx 18 x 15 x 5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 5 pounds (one medium size game or two to three small games) - $20.60
FedEx 18 x 15 x 9_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 8 pounds (one large or two medium size games) - $26.45
FedEx 18 x 15 x 13_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 10 pounds (two large or three medium size games) - $32.95
FedEx 24 x 13 x 9_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - up to 10 pounds (one extra large game) - $28.00
USPS Priority Mail Small Flat Rate Box (suitable for one very small game) - $6.60
USPS Priority Mail Medium Flat Rate Box (either configuration, suitable for one medium size or two small games) - $12.65
USPS Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box (either configuration, suitable for one large game or three small games) - $17.15
Local pickup - no charge
Costs include shipping materials. Unless a larger box is specifically requested, shipments by FedEx will be in whatever of the above box sizes best fits the total order with reasonable room for padding (1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; margin minimum on all sides, 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or more preferred). Shipment by USPS will be in whatever flat rate box best fits the game - keep in mind the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;game size_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; flat rate boxes leave very little width or height for padding for standard size games and are not recommended on that basis. In either case seller is not responsible for damage during transit. Prices for heavier FedEx shipments than listed above will be costed (increased) accordingly. Short hop FedEx shipment prices significantly lower than the above baseline will be costed (decreased) accordingly. Discount of $3 on FedEx shipping to a FedEx recognized business addresses. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Shipping terms and rates are NOT NEGOTIABLE.</notes>

Condition - New in shrink-wrap.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve said _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; but it is close to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. Only played twice. Lacking a box insert and any non-English rules.
My preference is to deliver locally, which means pretty much anywhere in Hampshire at a mutually convenient time. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very happy to come to a Southampton On Board evening, or the Stabcon South event in early April. Failing that I can ship within the UK only, through an agreed courier. The buyer pays the shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>NOTE: I have had 4 enquiries on this item already. I had to hide it while I made updates. I am offering it to the people that enquired first, so please DO NOT BID on this item now. I hope this is OK.
Bought new, punched, played once or twice, put away. Never liked it.
This is the earliest edition. My copy is in excellent condition. There is the very slightest of wear on the bottom edges in two small places. Otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s as good as new. German rules in the box, with a print out of the English rules.
Can provide photos of my copy on request.
Can ship in the UK quickly, other places will need research (new at this).
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English. [b]The version that everybody wants with the nice wood pieces!!  And the more functional art.[/b]
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Played maybe twice, selling because I have too many games. Smoke-free home. I live in Mid-Missouri, so shipping is pretty standard.
I will upload pictures soon hopefully...
