   <description>Discover the lost treasures of Egypt and make your fortune! _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; You are an archaeologist working the dig sites of the Egyptian desert. Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots and other priceless artifacts. Explore an ancient pyramid hoping to uncover a huge stash of treasure! Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The aim of the game is to make the most money by finding treasures and selling them to the museum.  Players find treasures by digging at the dig site (draw pile of cards).  Sets of treasures are collected over the course of the game and players choose the best time to sell them to the museum.  Once a player sells a treasure set to the museum the value of that set is credited to the player, and is no longer subject to loss or theft._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If a player finds any maps at the dig site, he can use them to explore an ancient pyramid where more treasures are hidden.  Players can trade their treasures with the local marketplace to increase the value of their collection.  If a player meets a thief at the dig site, he will use this thief to steal treasure from another player.  If a sandstorm hits, all players are affected and may lose some of their treasure._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG4050)
Discover the lost treasures of Egypt and make your fortune! You are an archaeologist working the dig sites of the Egyptian desert. Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots, and other priceless artifacts. Trade shrewdly at the marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum for maximum profit. But beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery. </notes>

Amazon gift cards or Bank Quickpay transfer greatly preferred, this is easiest for me.  Paypal or money orders ok too.  Any questions, feel free to ask.

    <notes>Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from Chicago, IL, USA. Local pickup is available.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>
