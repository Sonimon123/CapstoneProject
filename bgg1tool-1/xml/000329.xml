The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Consolidated Rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.  However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The Wargame Academy Tournament Rules_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Various rules are subject to interpretation.

To that end custom map extensions have been designed by more than one player.  The VASSAL module now has map extensions available as an option for play.

Also includes the original postcard for a friend (to send them an Avalon Hill catalog) and the blank subscription card for The Avalon Hill General magazine.
Box has some wear on the edges and corners and one area on the front that has bubbled slightly...looks like the glue bunched up underneath it.  All contents are in perfect condition.

    <notes>Punched, verified complete. Excellent condition appears unplayed. Very good counters well cut away from the pane, i.e. using an exacto as opposed to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;punching_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  The rules and charts/cards are very good to like new.  Box is excellent.  AND you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive a comprehensive article collection of almost all the published articles. Including many not listed on the article index. You have to know where they are and have the periodical. e.g. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Russian Front Overtime_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;German Front_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; variants. Plus a copy of an introductory scenario from the HTF Battleplan #9. I leave out  the General articles because they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re common and if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have an issue you most certainly have the issues on a disc.  So I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll  assemble the esoteric and/or HTF together in a kit it will take a weekend to just read through.</notes>

    <notes>[b]Box:[/b] Both front and bottom box have a cut corner on the upper right side (clean cut that can be taped). Otherwise the box shows shelfwear and some bleeching, but is intact.
[b]Components:[/b] Counters, maps, PACs and rulebooks are still in pretty good condition given the games age.</notes>
