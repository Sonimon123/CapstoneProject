To do this, you must first buy the best mining concessions, hoping to find gold veins. You can also try to become the Mayor of Whiskey River or San Narciso, in order to get a small cut on concessions sales, or build a saloon where lucky prospectors will spend their nuggets in moonshine whiskey. If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you. A well placed stick of dynamite can also solve some minor problems._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Piraci features the same gameplay as Boomtown, but with the players now sailing the waters instead of panning them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>Face2Face Games (F2F 101064N)
Boomtown is a game with auctions, dice, and some fun and nasty action cards to play on your fellow gold diggers.
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gold in them thar hills!
In Boomtown, you start as a gold digger and try to end as a tycoon.
To do this, you must first buy the best mining concessions, hoping to find gold veins. You can also try to become the Mayor of Whiskey River or San Narciso, in order to get a small cut on concessions sales, or build a saloon where lucky prospectors will spend their nuggets in moonshine whiskey. If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you. A well placed stick of dynamite can also solve some minor problems.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gold in them thar hills!
In Boomtown — a game with auctions, dice, and fun/nasty action cards to play on opponents — you start as a gold digger and try to end as a tycoon. To do this, you must first buy the best mining concessions, hoping to find gold veins. You can also try to become the Mayor of Whiskey River or San Narciso, in order to get a small cut on concessions sales, or build a saloon where lucky prospectors will spend their nuggets in moonshine whiskey. If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you. A well placed stick of dynamite can also solve some minor problems.
Piraci features the same gameplay as Boomtown, but with the players now sailing the waters instead of panning them.
