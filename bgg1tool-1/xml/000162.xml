   <description>The Eighth Edition is finely produced with thick cardboard counters and a sturdy thick game board. The rules are in full color (with cartoon) and very well done. This humorously entertaining game pits two players against each other aboard a spaceship.  One plays the ship's crew, trying to kill the evil and rapidly-multiplying aliens controlled by his opponent.  And although the crew members have several weapons available to them, they don't know what effect those weapons will have until they try using them in combat against the Awful Green Things. Originally appeared in the Dragon magazine #28.  The Outside the Znutar expansion, published in Dragon magazine #40, is included in the box in the Steve Jackson Games versions of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A similar but more serious game is The Wreck of the B.S.M.

    <notes>Purple box edition.  Box, inner tray and board are very good.  Rules are photocopied.  This rule book indicates 151 counters, but game has 128 counters.  I also have a copy of a counter sheet showing 148 counters.  So I think there may be differnet editions with different numbers of counters.  There are some hand made counters also included.</notes>

    <notes>Condition:
I have the original map, but this also comes with my color photocopy enlarged and laminated map. All cardboard counters are mounted to custom wood blocks for ease of play and enhanced aesthetics. This is a great custom set that allows an ease of play unknown to the original cramped and cheap production. Pictures of my custom set are here on BGG, check the game images.
$6.00 shipping cost inside USA. Will be sent USPS Priority Mail from Minnesota.

Punched but never played. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve put in 6 normal sized green dice to supplement the 4 little green ones they give you (box says they give you 5, mine came with 4). 
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If you order several games from me, I will combine shipping.

    <notes>Offering the big box Steve Jackson version (I think that this is the collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item version).
Condition Notes:
Played once.  Contents look almost unused.  Box has some shelfwear and slight dishing.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE.
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address.
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price).
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 30 cents higher.

    <notes>The game is the TSR 1980 version, blue box as depicted in BGG. This is the oldest version of the game and has all the original pieces. The game is in great shape, all pieces are there, the box cover is a little torn, but still functional. Would make a great addition to any game collection!</notes>

    <notes>Box is a little bit dented, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in good shape.  Very playable.
Let me know where you live (zip code at least) and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be happy to calculate the shipping costs for you to keep it cheap.
To cut down on the possibility of scams (all too common I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m afraid), I will issue a paypal invoice for all transactions and will wait a few (no more than business 3 days) prior to shipping for payment to clear.  So you will need a verified Paypal account, and make sure the shipping address is correct on it.
If there are special cases, just let me know and we can see about working something out!</notes>

Monsters Everywhere!
The crew of the exploration ship Znutar just wanted to cruise around the Galaxy, discovering strange new worlds and playing pool. But then their ship was invaded by the Awful Green Things . . . and suddenly they were fighting for their lives!
In this wacky two-player game, one player controls the Awful Green Things. They grow and multiply every turn - especially if they can gobble up a crew member! The other player commands the crew, frantically trying weapon after weapon (pool sticks, fire extinguishers, cans of Zgwortz) to find something that kills the monsters.
This classic game by Tom Wham first appeared in Dragon Magazine in 1980, and has been a fan favorite ever since! This edition includes Tom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Outside the Znutar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rules and counters, for going out the airlocks and fighting on the surface of the ship, and upgraded components: a mounted gameboard, heavy die-cut counters, and a full-color rulebook!</notes>

    <notes>Steve Jackson Games (SJG1335)
Monsters Everywhere! The crew of the exploration ship Znutar just wanted to cruise around the Galaxy, discovering strange new worlds and playing pool. But then their ship was invaded by the Awful Green Things . . . and suddenly they were fighting for their lives! In this wacky two-player game, one player controls the Awful Green Things. They grow and multiply every turn - especially if they can gobble up a crew member! The other player commands the crew, frantically trying weapon after weapon (pool sticks, fire extinguishers, cans of Zgwortz) to find something that kills the monsters. This classic game by Tom Wham first appeared in Dragon Magazine in 1980, and has been a fan favorite ever since! This edition includes Tom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Outside the Znutar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rules and counters, for going out the airlocks and fighting on the surface of the ship, and upgraded components: a mounted gameboard, heavy die-cut counters, and a full-color rulebook! </notes>

    <notes>This is the original insert from Dragon magazine.
The counters have been nicely mounted on cardboard and laminated. They are in great shape and bagged.
Map and rules in great condition.
The rules mention there should be 140 counters. The actual counter manifest on BGG shows only 139. The game has 139 counters. The difference is that the rules say there should be 29 weapons, but there are actually only 28. Based on this I think the game is complete.
This does not include the Dragon magazine this game originally came in.</notes>

    <notes>It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an old classic so the outside box has seen better days. It is however complete and comes with the original Steve Jackson promo stuff (including the 1994-95 product catalog). The rule book has some color coordinated highlights to make reference a little quicker. I also scanned the original board, enlarged it, and mounted the new board for a slightly larger play area. Trust me when the fighting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fierce, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be thankful for the extra room to stack all those chits. I took a picture of the new map by the old one so you can see the difference. Coming from a smoke free home.
