   <description>This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>When this hard to find game lists on ebay it normally goes for about $125-150. On a game retailer site, your looking at a price of at LEAST $150. This copy is in great shape, punched but almost like new.
I will consider trades, though I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty picky about what I want (see my wants). This price is non-negotable. 
I will accept Paypal if you pay the 3% I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m charged. Personal checks will delay shipping until they clear. 
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This s a spare copy of the game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;d forgotten I had.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s one of from the last great AH sell off from Amazon.com; so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s got two pieces of tape to seal it and no shrinkwrap.  Altho the box itself is a bit shelf worn, I would imagine that the contents are mint and unpunched.</notes>

    <notes>This is my heavily played copy of Titan from college.  The box has heavy scuffing and two split corners. The rules are completly readable but have stains.  The board and counters show wear.  There are two counters missing.  A warbear and a giant.  I replaced them with homemade stick figure counters drawn on some blanks.  They are ugly but they work.  Anyway this is a copy for game players not collectors and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s available for a reasonable price. I will send pictures on request. </notes>

    <notes>Everything complete EXCEPT missing 1 green legion control marker. Only an issue if you play with 6, and probably not even then as someone will always be eliminated before anyone gets to 12 legions.
Also, the battlelands have the name of the reverse side land written below the land name on each sheet, so you can easily see what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s on the back without flipping them over and over again. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s written neatly in ink.
This is a great copy of a very hard-to-find game. I will require the buyer to pay for postal insurance on this game as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very rare.</notes>

    <notes>The box has seen some wear from a long shelf life. I once had an accident with some water which has left a stain on the backside of the box, but NONE of the counters or boards have been affected.
Rulebook, counters and bits are all a bit worn, but not much.
I prefer Paypal or Western Union
Shipping will be by airmail and will cost 41$ to USA
Feel free to email me other questions or other shipping costs to your country.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a Box of Titan, missing the following elements:
- chits:
1 guardian, 1 centaur, 1 lion, 1 ranger and 2 light brown legion marker (there are a few blank counters left though). This is enough for at least a 5 player game (tested once, never found a 6th player to test though)
- Battlelands: there are printouts of the 11 battlelands included with the game, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not the original ones.
- Rulebook: There is also a printout of the rules (as found on the net). They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not a copy of the original ones though.
- dice
The box itself is in acceptable condition (per BGG criteria), with some wear and tear, an adhesive tape over the lid (I can figure out a way to remove it without ruining the box), and a scratch on the bottom.
The counter themselves are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition, as well as the main board. Some of the damage counters are still unpunched.</notes>

    <notes>Gently used. Excellent copy for playing. 
The game really is in good condition overall. Condition is actually in between Good and Acceptable. But just so you know exactly what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting, here is a full description of the condition:
Missing one non-crucial piece (one of the 12 red army cover-counters; the other five colors have all 12). Possibly also missing one or two creatures (email me for exact count of each creature type, if desired). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played this several times (2-4 players) and never come close to running out of any counters. 
Everything else is complete and for the most part in very good condition: master gameboard, tactical combat terrain maps, dice, and rulebook. Dice are small d6, probably not original (original game apparently came with only four d6). Also includes two small plastic bins (not part of original game) that contain all the counters - these are handy to keep things organized (there are tons of counters in this game). 
Box is a little worn. There are a few blemishes on a couple terrain boards (see photo) and one box corner has tape on it. A small minority of the counters are very slightly darker than others, from use or age I imagine - I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t call this very noticeable. I have included a picture of what I believe to be the only imperfections of any significance – the couple small blotches on two tactical maps, and clear tape on one corner of the box.
I have bought stuff online before, and I know how nice it is to know exactly what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting. Unlike many ebay auctions that may just say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Used_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and show you a picture of the outer box, I have tried to give a complete and accurate description of this game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition. 
Feel free to email me, and I will be happy to provide more photos or more details. I bought this copy used, about five years ago. My home is smoke, mold, and pet free. The game has no mildew smell or anything.
This is my first time selling on BGG. But I have sold several things on ebay - my ebay user name is payson64. Check out my profile:
http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;userid=payson64_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;items=25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;page=2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;frompage=-1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;iid=-1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;de=off
This is one of my favorite games. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played this copy about five times. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sad to let it go, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much time for long games like this, now that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got two young kids.

SHIPPING INFO:
I will ship worldwide. Exact shipping will be charged - no extra _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;handling fees._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; If you are dissatisfied with this game, you may return it and I will refund the full price, plus half of your return shipping cost.

    <notes>bought this game for my nephew about 15 years ago and he never played it.
clearing out his family attic we found it and was returned back to me.
seeing the prices of titan on ebay right now i think the price of 90 + 8.60 priority shipping in the us is fair.

Box, map and counters are in excellent condition. I only played this game for 3 or 4 times. Everything is present except for 1 of the 4 original (crappy) dice. One battleland has a very light stain (see picture),  otherwise all bits are in excellent condition.

    <notes>Brought game from Amazon a while back, when the game arrived, it does not have the shrinkwrap on, instead it is sealed with two thick clear tape on the side and have a sticker label with the wordings _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For AGES 8 and Up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in the lower right corner of the box cover (see pictures).
I then called Amazon up and asked about the condition of the game and worried that they are selling used copy of the game. They then send me a replacement copy and the game that came is the same condition. I called them up again and confirmed that all their copies are in the same condition - no shrinkwrap but sealed with two tapes.
This is the original condition of the game as it came to my house.
One of the clear tape is loosen due to age/storage (see again pictures). But beside this, everything is in pristine new condition. I have stored the game in a box, so the wear to the outer box is minimal.
Thus the game can be claimed as new, unpunched and unopened. That is the condition of the game.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original, self-published version of Titan from a production run of 500.
The set has been played twice. The paper shows some foxing consistent with its age. One of the die has cracked. Following the suggestion of the publishers, the cardboard game pieces were clearcoated with Krylon to prevent ink bleed before they were punched out. The box shows its age, and is slightly dinged. Included in the set are typescript notes and errata on the game along with all playing pieces, boards, and rulebook.
Will ship anywhere, but will need to work out shipping costs separately if outside USA.</notes>

    <notes>AVALON HILL in MINT condition!!! I was a boardgame collector in the Eighties, but have not played in the last fifteen years. I never bought used items, I only bought them new in the shop. I have played TITAN (Bookcase Game by Avalon Hill) a few times (5-10) in the Eighties, but was very very carefully. All counters are there in separate boxes. Board, counters, rulebook and sheets are in absolutely MINT condition. The box would be perfect, like new, but on one bookcase-sideit has a light damage, but colour is NOT broken. Shipping: Germany 6 Euro. EU in Europe: 17 Euro. Rest of Europe: 30 Euro. USA, Canada: 35 Euro. Rest of the World: 40 Euro. International Paying per PayPal, in Europe and Germany bank transfer too - auch per Überweisung. Perfekt erhaltene Ausgabe von TITAN (Bookcase Game von Avalon Hill). mit allen Bestandteilen. Wurde von mir damals neu im Laden gekauft und auch beim Spielen (5-10mal) wie ein rohes Ei behandelt. Spielbrett, Counter (in kleinen Boxen geordnet), Rulebook und Sheets sind deshalb noch immer in Top-Zustand!!! Box sehr gut erhalten - wie neu, wäre da nicht eine leichte Delle an einer Bookcase-Seite, aber die Farbe ist noch intakt (wie minimale Risse im Lila der Box, bei denen man aber kaum Weiß wahrnimmt). Sonst alles, als wäre es eben NEU gekauft worden! Deutsche Übersetzung der Regeln liegt auch bei.</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY 004)
Titan is back! And it has brought along a few hundred of its friends!
 
Titan is a full-out monster slug-a-thon, in which players must be prepared to sacrifice their creatures to cause maximum damage to their opponents. Players take the role of the Titan, and roam the board attempting to recruit bigger and badder monsters to fight for their legions. But just as your own army grows, your opponents themselves will be seeking the clash of battle, and there can be only one true Titan!
Titan is played on a main gameboard, where armies are recruited, and positions set. When two armies meet, the action transfers to a battleboard, where the opposing forces battle for position and power. Only the strongest monsters will survive, bringing both points and glory to their Titan.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Valley Games edition of Titan, released circa 2009.
  
It is in excellent condition with very minimal wear and tear. I would list it in New condition except all the pieces are punched out.  
All components are 100% intact and present and the game has been well preserved.
If you are looking for a copy of Titan you cannot go wrong with my copy. 
I will ship first class and seller will pay for shipping.

I just wish I could have gotten it to the table more than once.  One corner of the box is split from when I received it new. Flat rate shipping because there are a lot of player boards in this game and it is very heavy.</notes>

    <notes>Description: 
Titan is back! And it has brought along a few hundred of its friends!
Titan is a full-out monster slug-a-thon, in which players must be prepared to sacrifice their creatures to cause maximum damage to their opponents. Players take the role of the Titan, and roam the board attempting to recruit bigger and badder monsters to fight for their legions. But just as your own army grows, your opponents themselves will be seeking the clash of battle, and there can be only one true Titan!
Titan is played on a main gameboard, where armies are recruited, and positions set. When two armies meet, the action transfers to a battleboard, where the opposing forces battle for position and power. Only the strongest monsters will survive, bringing both points and glory to their Titan.

Punched but never played.  All parts are in great, original condition.  The box is in very good shape with minor scuffs at the corners.  Also for sale is the Valley Games Titan Expansion I figures still in the box.  They are delicate but unbroken.  These were offered to folks who pre-ordered the game from Valley Games.

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will normally be by courier (3-5 working days) with a charge of £4.99 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £3.49. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.

There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a small nick one corner of the lid and the single-sided board has some surface damage on the unplayed, unused side (not the play surface). Also, in the nature of full disclosure, note that the Valley Games version of the game is heavy and the components push against the walls of the box, making future damage to at least one corner of the box walls likely (as far as I know all copies of this version are going to have this same _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;feature_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;). Combined shipping available. Buyer pays shipping from CA. Local pickup (San Ramon area, maybe Davis or Stockton areas) possible.</notes>

    <notes>Hello,  This is a copy of Titan from Avalon Hill back in 1980.  My wife and I read the rules over two hours and in our first battle I killed her Titan winning the game in 15 minutes so she swore she would never play again.   Game and parts are in great shape for a 30 year old game. Non smoking home.  I am selling it to someone that will give it a good home and enjoy the game.</notes>

    <notes>Complete Unpunched game. The box has some light shelf wear overall and some foxing (light tan spotting) on two of the side panels and just along the very top edge of the box top; with a small ding in the center along the bottom edge of the box bottom. The Rules booklet is lightly wrinkled overall, has one very small tan spot left of center near the top edge of the front page, and there are some small rust marks near the staples in the center. Counter sheets are clean and white where they are supposed to be with no wear. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rate the Counter sheets and BattleLands (the six BattleLands sheets are still bound together, as published, with only the top and bottom of the sheet bundle pictured) as near mint, the MasterBoard as excellent, the Rules as very good (downgraded due to obvious handling wear), and the Box as good (downgraded due to foxing).

    <notes>The game has great color and little wear on the box except for two very clean splits at two corners of the the lid (could easily be taped on the inside with little to discern the split from the outside and one corner of the box bottom has a split.  This game is super heavy and the splits occurred as a result of some clumsy handling that promptly split the corners.  A couple of the game boards have slight scuffs at one of their edges that can be seen upon close inspection.  The tiles and other game materials are in great shape.
The game will be shipped via USPS priority mail from 43202 and the packed game weighs in at 7 lbs. 6 oz.  I am only shipping to US addresses at this time.
Please let me know of any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete except it appears to be missing 1 of the 20 dice that came in the box. Box has a few split corners that have been taped, but it still looks good and shows only minor shelf wear. Rule book shows a bit of wear from being flipped through, but still perfectly readable. All other components look great and I would say they are in very good condition.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill version. The board, charts and counters are all in very good condition. The box has some shelfware and also has three small-ish tears on the one box-spine.
However, the game is missing one Lion token (out of 28 total in the game), all of the casualty markers and the two dice. There are six spare blank counters in the box so making a replacement for Lion would not be a problem and it is also not likely that you will need all the Lion counters every game.

    <notes>This is Titan Valley Games Edition. I bought it brand new right when it came out and opened the exterior shrink wrap but never got around to playing it. Everything in the box is still unpunched and unplayed. The box has some shelf wear but everything else is in perfect condition.
The game weighs approximately 8 lbs, and shipping will be calculated upon checkout. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing it will be somewhere around $15-20 depending upon your location. I will ship worldwide, but it will obviously cost extra. The game will be packaged carefully so it arrives at your doorstep in the same condition in which I sent it out.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>I have a 1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Titan board game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to move. This is the older version with the pinkish box. Not sure the price is right so let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s negotiate. 
The game is almost entirely intact with only a small number of wound markers missing. The main board and the battle boards are all in excellent shape but the box is heavily worn with two torn corners. 
I can ship to continental US for 8.00.</notes>
