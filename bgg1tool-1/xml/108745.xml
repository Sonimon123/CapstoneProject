   <description>The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first phase _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Prelude_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Draw new cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;time track_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; would move forward._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;exchange rates_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMSEAS01)
Assuming the role of one of the greatest sorcerers of the time, you will be participating in the legendary tournament of the 12 Seasons. Your goal is to raise the most victory points by gathering energy, summoning familiars and magic items. If you amass enough crystals and symbols of prestige, you will become the kingdom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most illustrious mage. Optimize the cards through skilful combinations, using the seasons wisely to access the energies of crystals and become the the new Archmage of the kingdom of Xidit. In a first phase, select 9 power cards at the same time as your opponents. Do the right choices, because they will determine the rest of the game. Acclimatize to the season to make the most of the actions proposed by each roll of the dice! Collect energies, invoke magical and familiar objects, and collect enough crystals, symbols of prestige. </notes>

Assuming the role of one of the greatest sorcerers of the time, you will be participating in the legendary tournament of the 12 Seasons. Your goal is to raise the most victory points by gathering energy, summoning familiars and magic items. If you amass enough crystals and symbols of prestige, you will become the kingdom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most illustrious mage. Optimize the cards through skilful combinations, using the seasons wisely to access the energies of crystals and become the the new Archmage of the kingdom of Xidit. In a first phase, select 9 power cards at the same time as your opponents. Do the right choices, because they will determine the rest of the game. Acclimatize to the season to make the most of the actions proposed by each roll of the dice! Collect energies, invoke magical and familiar objects, and collect enough crystals, symbols of prestige. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMSEAS01)
Assuming the role of one of the greatest sorcerers of the time, you will be participating in the legendary tournament of the 12 Seasons. Your goal is to raise the most victory points by gathering energy, summoning familiars and magic items. If you amass enough crystals and symbols of prestige, you will become the kingdom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most illustrious mage. Optimize the cards through skillful combinations, using the seasons wisely to access the energies of crystals and become the new Arch mage of the kingdom of Xidit. In a first phase, select 9 power cards at the same time as your opponents. Do the right choices, because they will determine the rest of the game. Acclimatize to the season to make the most of the actions proposed by each roll of the dice! Collect energies, invoke magical and familiar objects, and collect enough crystals, symbols of prestige.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMSEAS01US)
Assuming the role of one of the greatest sorcerers of the time, you will be participating in the legendary tournament of the 12 Seasons. Your goal is to raise the most victory points by gathering energy, summoning familiars and magic items. If you amass enough crystals and symbols of prestige, you will become the kingdom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most illustrious mage. Optimize the cards through skillful combinations, using the seasons wisely to access the energies of crystals and become the new Arch mage of the kingdom of Xidit. In a first phase, select 9 power cards at the same time as your opponents. Do the right choices, because they will determine the rest of the game. Acclimatize to the season to make the most of the actions proposed by each roll of the dice! Collect energies, invoke magical and familiar objects, and collect enough crystals, symbols of prestige.</notes>

    <notes>In sehr gutem Zustand, zwei oder dreimal gespielt.
Versand innerhalb Deutschlands als DHL-Paket ist 5,99 €
Versand außerhalb Deutschlands ist grundsätzlich auch möglich, allerdings lohnt sich das bei den derzeitigen Versandpreisen eigentlich nicht. Ihr könnt mich aber gerne anschreiben, wenn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s trotzdem sein soll.
---------------------
In great condition, played no more than three times.
Shipping within Germany is 5,99€
Generally speaking, shipping outside of Germany is also possible, yet not really practical due to the high shipping costs these days. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d still like to have this shipped internationally, just contact me and I can provide the shipping cost for your destination.</notes>
