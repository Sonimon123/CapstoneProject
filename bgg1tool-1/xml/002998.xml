   <description>(from GMT website:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reds! is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Moslem partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    One 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Game Map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    One Sheet of 240 Counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Two Player Aid Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    One Rule Book _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE     1-2 months per turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE     65 miles per hex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE     Brigades, Divisions, Corps, and Armies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis and Volko Ruhnke_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

    <notes>The game is complete. The counters and map look (and are) hardly used. The only real downside is a minor dent in the frontcover and the back of the cover is very wavy (NOT due to getting wet or something - it looks more like a production error). Non-smoking household. I accept PayPal or direct transfer into my account</notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT011112)
In the spring of 1917, the Tsarist autocracy of Nicholas II collapsed under the strains of the Great War (World War I). In the fall of that year, Lenin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Bolsheviks toppled the shaky Russian Provisional Government. White anti-Bolshevik forces were quickly routed, and Lenin soon declared resistance to the regime at an end. He was mistaken. With western support, White forces began to gather in the Caucasus, in Siberia, and in the far north to oppose the Reds. The new Russian government also faced opposition from ethnic minorities who wished to break loose from the Empire and from other left-wing parties (not least, groups of well-armed Anarchists). By August, 1918, the Reds, controlling the heartland of Russia, were threatened by enemies to the east, north, and south. Not until late 1919 would the tide turn decisively in their favor. But, in 1920, the Reds would face a new threat - an invasion by the armies of the newly independent Poland. Reds! is a two-player wargame covering these dramatic events from August 1918 to the start of 1921, when the last organized opposition to Red rule outside the far east was destroyed. The single large-hex map stretches from Warsaw in the west to Omsk in the east and from Murmansk in the north to Tashkent in the south. Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies. Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Moslem partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train. To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side. From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game. It is also a realistic depiction of some of the most titanic and unusual campaigns of modern history.</notes>

    <notes>*** With every sale we donate a percentage to the Veterans Support Foundation (including this sale). ***
Wargame Depot has donated over $7,700 to this wonderful cause thanks, largely, to the wonderful Boardgamegeek community. Thank you so much for your continued support of Wargame Depot which has allowed us to give generously to the VSF.
Mint, in shrink copy available.  No dings, no dents, or anything wrong with the game.  Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
$12 shipping to US - write me for a quote to the rest of the world.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so a purchase from me will always be packed professionally and I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
And if you want this game plus anything else that I am selling on BGG, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course be happy to add other items on in order to save you on shipping!
North Carolina residents pay 7% sales tax.

dadoodoflow
The price has been set at the winning bid, or Buy It Now, price posted to the auction item comment page.
If you won multiple items, please be sure to add them all to your cart at once and then check out so I can include them in your shipping estimate.
As a reminder:
I will only ship to the addresses within the United States.
I only accept PayPal and payment details will be sent alongside your final invoice.
Your item(s) will ship on the Saturday FOLLOWING verified payment. 
I will provide tracking information for your item and insurance sufficient to cover the final price of the auction on shipped items.
Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.
If you have any special requests, please Geekmail me so we can discuss prior to payment finalization.
Thank you for your purchase and I hope you enjoy your new game(s)!</notes>
