GAME OVERVIEW:
MISTFALL - BASE GAME[/b]
Mistfall is a fully co-operative adventure game set in a fantasy world of mystery, eldritch powers and high adventure.
At the start of the game each player chooses a hero with a fixed deck of equipment and power cards, before embarking on a dangerous journey through a set of monster-ridden locations. Each hero also comes with a pool of advanced abilities that can be added to their basic deck during the game to customize and expand their powers. A variable board setup, randomized encounters and enemies, a simple but robust monster AI – all that makes for a game that is a varied and challenging experience both solitaire as well as with a group of up to three friends.
Gather up your resolve, check your gear and get ready to brave the unrelenting Mists. A world of perilous adventures awaits!
[b]MISTFALL: VALSKYRR - THE CAMPAIGN EXPANSION[/b]
Valskyrr expands Mistfall with a campaign system in different ways. Some of the features can also be used in the classic game variant.
Legacy Feats: A new deck of special Feats that can be purchased by any Hero. Use these abilities to sharpen your keen edge or supply your Hero with a little bit of what is not usually their forte.
Setting Cards: As your Hero Develops, so do the Mists. The expansion pack comes with a small deck of cards that will randomize ways in which each subsequent Quest will become harder, as the relentless Mists, aware of your presence, will push back, trying to stop your advance.
Elite Enemies: The Valskyrr will also come with an alternative version of one type of Enemy from each of the three groups (Wildlanders, Borderlanders and Undead). When introduced by a Setting, these will succeed the Regular Enemies in their respective decks, making the most basic footman of your Enemy a greater challenge to face.
Epic Villains: Just like the Regular Enemies, some of the biggest and baddest evildoers will receive an upgrade. The expansion will provide you with a final battle that will truly feel like a worthy conclusion to an epic tale.
Character Development
Over the course of four Quests, your Hero will be able to retain a limited number of their Advanced Feats bought during the game, not only giving you a sense of continuity, but also allowing you to make more strategic decisions before going off on another perilous adventure.
Legacy Feats
A new deck of special Feats that can be purchased by any Hero. Use these abilities to sharpen your keen edge or supply your Hero with a little bit of what is not usually their forte. And although each Legacy Feat can be used only once per Quest, once bought, it will return to your deck before you brave the Mists once more.
Setting Cards
As your Hero Develops, so do the Mists. The expansion pack comes with a small deck of cards that will randomize ways in which each subsequent Quest will become harder, as the relentless Mists, aware of your presence, will push back, trying to stop your advance. The Setting cards can also be used in a single-Quest game by players who wish to make it a more challenging and changing experience.
Elite Enemies
The Valskyrr will also come with an alternative version of one type of Enemy from each of the three groups (Wildlanders, Borderlanders and Undead). When introduced by a Setting, these will succeed the Regular Enemies in their respective decks, making the most basic footman of your Enemy a greater challenge to face. Similarly to the Setting Cards, these tough opponent can be use in a single-Quest game to raise the difficulty level.
Epic Villains
Just like the Regular Enemies, some of the biggest and baddest evildoers will receive an upgrade. The expansion will provide you with a final battle that will truly feel like a worthy conclusion to an epic tale. And, once again, you will be able to use these alternate versions of the already known villains in single Quests, if you feel the game is not challenging enough to suit your tastes.

Includes the campaign and anything else.
i went and bought everything individually. 
I also sleeved alot of cards, and added in the cards that needed to be reprinted. 
I played once with a group and then, another session of learning the rules solo.
Please find me a safe home for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mistfall_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. He doesnt eat much, and he needs a good loving home</notes>
