   <description>Howdy, ya'll._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;C'mon in and sit a spell. Let me tell ya about Jack Colty and his gang, and get ya up to gallop on all the interestin' events. Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The year is 1892._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Adios, Amigoes!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Chew on this, Gringo!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;He shot my hat clean off!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Fire at will, boys._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory Conditions:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Escape across the Mexican border._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Kittens_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG8 002)
The year is 1892. The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed. Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as the gang shot its way, whooping and holering, out of town.  Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty – a man so mean he”d steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man”s eyes – and the Colty gang to justice. Revolver is a non-collectible card game set in the Old West.  One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang, lead by the infamous Jack Colty.  Each player has his own dieck with different cards and abilities.  Both players have different goals to win the game: the Colonel must take down all of the Colty gang, and Jack must either escape over the Mexican Border or survive and make the 3:15 Train out of Rattlesnake Station during the final battle!   Consisting of two unique, yet balanced, 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle.  Do you (as Colonel Ned McReady) have what it takes to bring Jack Colty and his gang to justice (or to their demise)?  OR, are you (as Jack Colty) mean enough to shoot down the rest of the lawmen and survive the day just to rob and pillage again?</notes>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SHG8002)
The year is 1892. The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed. Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as the gang shot its way, whooping and holering, out of town. Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;d steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s eyes - and the Colty gang to justice. Revolver is a non-collectible card game set in the Old West. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang, lead by the infamous Jack Colty. Each player has his own dieck with different cards and abilities. Both players have different goals to win the game: the Colonel must take down all of the Colty gang, and Jack must either escape over the Mexican Border or survive and make the 3:15 Train out of Rattlesnake Station during the final battle! Consisting of two unique, yet balanced, 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. Do you (as Colonel Ned McReady) have what it takes to bring Jack Colty and his gang to justice (or to their demise)? OR, are you (as Jack Colty) mean enough to shoot down the rest of the lawmen and survive the day just to rob and pillage again?</notes>

Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as the gang shot its way, whooping and holering, out of town. Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;d steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s eyes - and the Colty gang to justice. Revolver is a non-collectible card game set in the Old West. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang, lead by the infamous Jack Colty. Each player has his own dieck with different cards and abilities. Both players have different goals to win the game: the Colonel must take down all of the Colty gang, and Jack must either escape over the Mexican Border or survive and make the 3:15 Train out of Rattlesnake Station during the final battle! Consisting of two unique, yet balanced, 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. Do you (as Colonel Ned McReady) have what it takes to bring Jack Colty and his gang to justice (or to their demise)? OR, are you (as Jack Colty) mean enough to shoot down the rest of the lawmen and survive the day just to rob and pillage again?</notes>

The year is 1892. The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed. Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as the gang shot its way, whooping and holering, out of town. Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;d steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s eyes - and the Colty gang to justice. Revolver is a non-collectible card game set in the Old West. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang, lead by the infamous Jack Colty. Each player has his own dieck with different cards and abilities. Both players have different goals to win the game: the Colonel must take down all of the Colty gang, and Jack must either escape over the Mexican Border or survive and make the 3:15 Train out of Rattlesnake Station during the final battle! Consisting of two unique, yet balanced, 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. Do you (as Colonel Ned McReady) have what it takes to bring Jack Colty and his gang to justice (or to their demise)? OR, are you (as Jack Colty) mean enough to shoot down the rest of the lawmen and survive the day just to rob and pillage again?</notes>

    <notes>The chance to buy the complete Revolver card game range from White Goblin Games. The main game has been played twice, and two of the expansions were played with. The Revolver 2 game is unopened and four of the expansions have not been played with.
So for sale are:
Revolver
Revolver 2: Last Stand at Malpaso
Revolver Expanions1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and Revolver 2 Expansion 2.1
As you can see from the pics, the bottom of the 1.2 expansion box does not close properly, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how I received it. Otherwise, the game and the boxes are in very good condition.
Great chance to own the whole collection.
Will post 2nd class signed for in two parcels, the cheapest way. £7.80. Post only to the UK.</notes>
