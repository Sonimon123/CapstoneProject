   <description>On 14 June 1800, the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte was taken by surprise and attacked by the Austrian army under General Melas. Outnumbered and out-gunned, the French were defeated and forced to retreat. But later that same day, French reinforcements arrived under General Desaix, and in what amounted to a second battle the French counter-attacked and won, taking thousands of prisoners and driving the Austrians from the field._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Thus was won the battle of which Napoleon was always the most proud _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Marengo._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bonaparte at Marengo recreates that dramatic battle.

    <notes>This game is in pristine condition and never played.  The shrink has been removed to check the contents which are perfect and complete.  The box is also in excellent condition.  This game is quite unusual and winner of the 2005 Charles S. Roberts award for pre-20th century wargames. It had a very small printing run and has been out of print for over a year.  
The map and playing pieces are truly innovative.</notes>

Played once and in excellent condition.  Wood pieces so how much wear could there be?  Box has a slight crease on the top side (received it that way) but everything else looks great.  Buyer pays actual shipping but I will combine shipping if you buy multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>The game is complete, save for one (1) copy of the original rule book. (The game was supposed to have two (2) rule books, but my copy only had one.) Upon receiving the game a second copy of the rules, plus some player aids, was downloaded from the publishers website, printed and are included. The game box bottom shows some shelf wear. There is a small dent in one corner of the box bottom and a very small dent in the bottom edge of the box top.</notes>
