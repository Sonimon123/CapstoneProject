       <name primary="true" sortindex="1">D-Day at Tarawa</name>
         
   <description>Based on John Butterfield's groundbreaking D-Day at Omaha Beach system, this solitaire game presents the critical days of fighting at platoon and company scale. You command the invading American forces against dug-in Japanese defenders, which are controlled by the game system. Tarawa covers the landings on Betio Island in November 1943, and the operations of the US 2nd Marine and 27th Infantry Divisions to clear it -- the first heavily contested landing of the Pacific War. The battle for the tiny Island raged for four days and, when it was finally over, fewer than 200 of the 5,000 Japanese defenders remained alive. One map, two counter-sheets and 55 cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Decision Games (DCG1025)
Command the US 2nd Marine Division in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;one square mile of hell_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;! D-Day at Tarawa is a solitaire game simulating the amphibious invasion of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. The US marines assaulting the tiny island, with its strategically vital airstrip, found themselves in their toughest battle of World War II, a fight to the death against 5000 Japanese defenders. D-Day at Tarawa advances the solitaire game system of its award-winning predecessor D-Day at Omaha Beach to the next level. You control the US forces against a tenacious Japanese defense. An innovative diceless combat system highlights unknown enemy deployments and the importance of the right weapons and tactics. Event cards keep the action flowing and the rules simple, while introducing extensive historical detail. Players familiar with Omaha Beach will recognize the harrowing amphibious landings, overlapping enemy fields of fire, uncanny Japanese strategies, and the emergence of US heroes and leaders, as the story of the two-day struggle unfolds. Tarawa adds new features covering LVT landing craft, movement through the surrounding coral reefs, close combat, Japanese night infiltration, US combat engineers and Japanese tanks.</notes>

Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) â preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (Â§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data â in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) â is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.

Command the US 2nd Marine Division in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;one square mile of hell_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;! D-Day at Tarawa is a solitaire game simulating the amphibious invasion of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. The US marines assaulting the tiny island, with its strategically vital airstrip, found themselves in their toughest battle of World War II, a fight to the death against 5000 Japanese defenders. D-Day at Tarawa advances the solitaire game system of its award-winning predecessor D-Day at Omaha Beach to the next level. You control the US forces against a tenacious Japanese defense. An innovative diceless combat system highlights unknown enemy deployments and the importance of the right weapons and tactics. Event cards keep the action flowing and the rules simple, while introducing extensive historical detail. Players familiar with Omaha Beach will recognize the harrowing amphibious landings, overlapping enemy fields of fire, uncanny Japanese strategies, and the emergence of US heroes and leaders, as the story of the two-day struggle unfolds. Tarawa adds new features covering LVT landing craft, movement through the surrounding coral reefs, close combat, Japanese night infiltration, US combat engineers and Japanese tanks.</notes>

D-Day at Tarawa advances the solitaire game system of its award-winning predecessor D-Day at Omaha Beach to the next level. You control the US forces against a tenacious Japanese defense. An innovative diceless combat system highlights unknown enemy deployments and the importance of the right weapons and tactics. Event cards keep the action flowing and the rules simple, while introducing extensive historical detail. Players familiar with Omaha Beach will recognize the harrowing amphibious landings, overlapping enemy fields of fire, uncanny Japanese strategies, and the emergence of US heroes and leaders, as the story of the two-day struggle unfolds. Tarawa adds new features covering LVT landing craft, movement through the surrounding coral reefs, close combat, Japanese night infiltration, US combat engineers and Japanese tanks.</notes>
