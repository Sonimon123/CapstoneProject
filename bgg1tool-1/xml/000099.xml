   <description>Fortress America, originally part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series, depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Star Wars_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; laser relay systems that fire from space._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Fortress America (2012)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This has the later cover without _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Saddam_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (despite what anyone may say, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Saddam_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cover is not rare). The pieces are about 1/3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;punched._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  All necessary plastic pieces are present (overall, 1 is broken and 2 are unusable due to manufacturing errors, but they are all extra pieces). 1 control marker is missing.  All components are in excellent condition.  The box has minor wear.</notes>

Shipping to the U.S. only. I can combine shipping on multiple items. Shipping within USA via USPS Parcel Post or Priority Mail, your choice. Thanks for looking!

    <notes>I did not get the chance to play this too often in my youth.  Therefore it is in very good shape.  The pieces are complete and look great.  There are even extra pieces still on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;spine_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  The board is unblemished, the cards look unused.  The only problem is the box.  While being stored, something must have fallen against it, and there is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;dent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; in the top.  I took a picture and uploaded it here on the Geek (#56809), so you can see the damage firsthand.
I was going to trade it away, but my trade fell through, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to sell it now.
Send me a message if you want me to figure out how much shipping will be, or if you have any other questions.
UPDATE:  I want to sell this so I can get other games, so I have reduced the price.  Also, I had the package weighed and it is 8 pounds.  It will be shipping from zip 12130 if you want to calculate the cost to ship it.</notes>

    <notes>Complete, punched.  Box has moderate wear, a couple corners are starting to split.  Saddam is on the cover of mine.  Cards are in excellent shape and the remaining components are fine. There are actually some extra components, mostly red, which are separated in a baggie.  Bigass box.  Free shipping to the continental USA.  Others please email me first for a shipping quote.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete. I have counted the pieces and carefully packaged so they will not fall out of the box. The outside box cover has been carefully _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;repaired_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to look very presentable.  Has the typical caved in top from age and storage, but is very presentable.  The game itself looks like it has never been played that much.  Has Saddam Hussein on cover.  Would be a welcome playable version of this game to your collection.  </notes>

    <notes>Condition as follows:
Board: Great shape, shows no wear/stains.
Pieces: All present, including extras.
Battle Markers: Missing 6 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;red invader_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; control/battle markers.
Rules: Photocopied copy of rules, battle sheet present. 
Box: Fair shape. One corner pushed in. 
Dice: All present.
Trays: Not even split apart yet - pristine. 
Pretty much the box shows heavy damage/wear and there are six red invader markers missing. Otherwise, the game is in excellent shape - no broken pieces and board is extremely playable. </notes>

    <notes>This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Saddam Hussein box cover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; edition. Complete (including extra pieces of every single type and color), except for the dice which are missing.  These are standard 6- 8- and 10-sided dice which are easily replaced.  All components are in great condition except one partisan card has a small crease on the corner.  Box is in good condition by MB Gamemaster standards: no split corners, but top is bowed in a little as usual and a small section of the outer paper label is torn away on one end (side) of the box. Buyer pays actual USPS shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Game pieces, board, rules, and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;extra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pieces are still in tact. The original dice are no longer with the game (we used the dice for other games while growing up and probably forgot to put them back in the box). These can easily be replaced with 6, 8, and 10 sided dice.
The game board and pieces are nearly _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition and only played 5-7 times. The box is structurally good but has signs of age and slight bowing (common for a game of this age).

Played but contents have been counted and verified complete.  Board is clean and undamaged, as are cards except for one small marring on back of one card (see photo below).
Styrofoam trays are separated but intact.  Box shows some wear around all the edges, and small compression creases top and bottom, but is structurally strong.
There are more figures included than you need to play the game, as the game originally came with extras.  The only exception are the blue infantry: one has a broken leg and one has a broken base, leaving 23 good ones.  The broken leg infantry is still playable, as it stands as well as the normal ones (see photo below)

    <notes>This copy was rescued from a thrift store, so the box is a little damaged. The box has:
? 1 taped corner on box top (upper left)
? 1 dinged corner on the top of box top (lower left)
? corner wear on all other corners (which is actually pretty normal for a game of this age)
? about 3-4mm of denting on box cover from crushing
? 1 split corner on box bottom (upper left)
The contents of the game are in remarkably exceptional condition. The game is nearly complete; all that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing is 5 red invader tokens, which can be replaced with generic tokens, as near as I can tell. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve confirmed that all other pieces are intact, and the pieces have all been sorted into a plastic sectioned organizer. In addition, the Styrofoam trays are all included, and still intact.
Shipping will be at my cost, but note that I am only shipping to the US.</notes>

    <notes>This is definitely a players copy and not for collectors.  All the parts are present and accounted for and the game itself is in pretty good shape for its age with the only damage being corner scuffing and age wear on the box.  This game has definitely been played quite a bit, but it was far from abused and all damage is solely due to use and age.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pricing it at $35 not due to condition, but to beat other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s prices and get this thing moved.  I need cash fast.
I prefer paypal for simplicities sake.
There is no USPS Flat Rate box that this game will fit into so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably ship USPS Parcel Post unless requested otherwise to the Continental US.  International buyers welcome, but shipping will be more and your responsibility.
Feel free to take a look at any other games I have for sale.  I will combine shipping and offer discounts on a case by case basis that will probably be anywhere from 10%-30% off depending on how many games are being purchased.
If you have any questions including any requests for pics, please geekmail me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll respond within 8 hours time.
Thanks,
Brian</notes>

    <notes>Fortress America (1987) by Milton Bradley (with bearded man and Twin Towers)
Box:  Moderate shelfwear with multiple dings and dents, the most significant of which is a deep corner crease that has caused a 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; split along one side near the corner.  Box top also has one split corner that was repaired with clear plastic packing tape.  Overall box is in decent yet unspectacular condition.
Components:  Complete and in like new condition!  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.   
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 6 lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

    <notes>Game condition:
The game is complete and the components are in very good condition, with spares to most pieces. Three of the dice are not original. Two blue d-10s have been replaced, and one red d-6 has been replaced with one that is very slightly smaller. The rules have seen some water sometime in the past and are musty. (That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what happens with age, I guess.)
Box condition:
Good. No tears or splits. Just corner/edge wear and slight dishing.
Language/Edition info:
English. Saddam cover.

    <notes>Fortress America is a classic strategy boardgame, published in early _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;90 by MB, the same of Axies _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies.
This is a used copy in very good condition.
Each Player has 60 military units:
    * 24 infantry
    * 12 hovertanks
    * 9 mobile units
    * 9 Helicopters
    * 6 Bombers
    * from 25 to 35 round battle tokens
The U.S.A. Player has in addition the following:
    * 12 Lasers
    * 30 city markers
    * 24 partisans
Board plan is like new and all pieces are in fine condition (about 320 pieces, more than 306 described on istructions).
There are also 12 dice (6,8,12 faces) and one Reference card. Manual in english and italian.
NOTES
- The carton box is worn on top cover but is otherwise in solid shape.
- There is a deck of partisans cards: originally 30 cards, but 3 cards were lost: these cards give extra units to Usa player and are very similar between them, so no lack to gameplay by this loss. (if you wish, you can buy lost cards here: www.gamepart.com/product/item/fly_119.html)

    <notes>1st edition with Sadam on the cover (no sunglasses). Box has heavy dishing top and bottom and shows wear commensurate with age, but is structural sound and otherwise in good shape. I have not counted every piece but judging from the condition of the components this game was played rarely, if at all, and appears complete. The largest styrofoam tray is missing a small chunk out of one of its compartment walls (fairly minor), though. Box isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t particularly heavy but is very large, so shipping will be a bit higher.</notes>
