   <description>This is the first of the Area-Impulse games done by Avalon Hill which later included Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout Normandy. The game simulates the ferocious battle for the Arnhem Bridge on September 18-21, 1944._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game begins with the British holding the area around the bridge, surrounded by the Germans. They try to hold out for as long as they can._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each full turn covers 8 hours and includes many mini-turns (or impulses). Each impulse, the player can move or fire a small number units. Once moved or fired, the units are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;committed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and cannot move or fire again until the next turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Combat is handled by calculating attack and defense values with each side adding the roll of 2 dice. The difference (if the attacker has the higher total) in final point values is the number of casualty points the defender must lose by retreating or destroying units._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The games is of relatively low complexity for a wargame and rates 3 (out of 10) on AH's difficulty scale._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Now this condition would be Very Good or even Like New except for one thing. The game is 95% unpunched. However, of the 5% that is punched, three or four counters are missing! The previous owner made up at least one replacement counter, but you would need to make a couple more. The counter sheets scans are available online, so this really shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be too much of a problem.
Pictures available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>Rating is kind of a mixed bag. Box shows some wear, inside everyhting there in great condition. All counters still unpunched.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Folio Edition, with unmounted map, 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (not 3/4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) counters and a 34-page history of the battle (part of the rulebook), which is not included in the boxed edition.
CONDITION: The game is in good condition, complete, with unpunched counters.  The rulebook has light handling wear and the folio cover has a fair amount of creasing, although it is still serviceable.  The countersheet and map are in excellent condition.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £2.75
European Postage: £4.25
Rest of World Postage: £7.25
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.

    <notes>Boxed edition
Box shows significant wear.  There is a 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long, ~1/8 inch wide tear in the paper of the box top.  The box has a small dent on one bottom edge.  The box top has an outward bow.  One corner of the box top was split and (neatly) glued back together. The rules are in acceptable to good condition with wear, dirt (including a couple dime sized dark patches on the back cover), and rust near the staples. The board is in good condition, with light wear and light dirt. The counters are in good condition with light dirt. I have checked to make sure they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all present, including the ones used by the early turn _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;crossing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; variant from the General magazine.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>Complete, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve counted all the counters and all other game materials are here as well.  Board is in nice shape except there is a some bowing of the cards board, which is typical for this style of game board and should level out through play and laying flat.  The rules have been thoroughly read and the front and back pages are torn off so as to allow easy viewing of some of the reference materials.  Game box is in good shape with some shelf and edgewear.
Shipping will be $8 to the Central and Eastern US; $10 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations please inquire.

    <notes>This is for the Avalon Hill Storm Over Arnhem game from 1981.
This is not the boxed game. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a folio edition and is in excellent condition.
The glossy-finished mapsheet is 32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and has everything the hard-backed mapboards have. The countersheet is unpunched, with 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters. The rulebook contains not only the rules, but an extensive historical commentary.
Mapsheet, counters and booklet are in as new condition.
For enthusiasts of this game, you could take this with you on your travels as well as play it at home.
Please contact me for shipping costs, especially if you live outside the UK.

I think it is a steal at this price -- but decided to price in line with other sellers.
This is a great game to play.

    <notes>Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of the original AH edition. Everything is present and mapboard and counters are in very good condition. Box and rulebook have been around the block once or twice. Box is dented on one side . . . OK, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;crushed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; would be a better descriptions with top having two torn corners and both showing a lot of wear. Rulebook is complete and totally readable but kind of crinkly (perhaps it was in a humid place for a while).
Still, complete and entirely playable. 
Discount shipping note: Fits into a Region A Priority Mail box, which means a discount (up to half price) priority mail shipping in the Western US.

    <notes>My late husband was an avid board game collector.  It is time for the games to find new homes, hopefully to someone who enjoys them as much as he did.  All his games are in excellent condition, he took very good care of them.   If he did play the games, no eating or drinking was allowed.  
Please feel free to ask any questions.   Thank you!</notes>
