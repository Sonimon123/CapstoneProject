   <description>A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo. The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo. Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Going into Exile_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Has 249 out of the 260 counters. I can try to provide a scan of the missing counters so you can print them out; in addition, there is a sheet of blank white counters you can use to make your own substitutes. Everything else is there. The box is very worn and creased. Definitely a players copy, not to sit pretty on the shelf!
I am willing to consider a trade for all or part of the value of this game. Shipping is $9 in the U.S. Will ship worldwide.</notes>

    <notes>Contient une traduction des règles en français.
This is the AH edition of Kremlin, with standard (english) rules and an additional booklet with french translation.
 - All components present and in good shape
 - box has some faded colors along the edges, nothing serious
 - comes with a plastic tray for holding game pieces, as well as a wooden cigarillo box for the cards (not part of the original game, but it fits nicely with the theme).
I can provide pictures if you want.
Contact me before buying so we can figure out shipping options and cost (expect ~15-20 Euros for US/Canada, less for Europe).</notes>

    <notes>KREMLIN (AH version, blue box), PLUS an original GENERAL magazine that featured the game. This is my personal copy of the game, purchased back in the 1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s. I played it 3-4 times over the years, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s moved with me many times so the box shows wear, however game is very clean, playable and 100% complete. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just not able to get this to the table, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to part with it. The General is clean and like new.</notes>

    <notes>Feb 2013 update - all counters are now accounted for, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added a 20 sided die to make up for the missing original.
This is the AH first edition of the game; blue box with Gorbachev on the cover, as pictured here:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/55578/kremlin
Includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Revolution_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion.
Missing the original 20 sided die, but I have a replacement. Box is split on one corner but otherwise intact. Rules have a slight _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;curl_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to the vertical edge; I can supply pictures on request. Other than that, I believe complete, but here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the full contents:
* 26 politician cards from the base game, with the funny names and flavor text
* 26 politician cards from Revolution with real people (Lenin, Malenkov, etc.) on one side with yellow borders, and the 26 phonies on the reverse
* 67 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Intrigue_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards - 1-34 loose in the box and are all white, 35-67 have yellow borders and are mainly unpunched although a few have come unattached.
* bagged counters, one or two have some slight ripping that I noticed but in general look great for a 25 year old game:
+ 30 blue with white sickle
+ 30 brown with black hammer and sickle
+ 30 green with white star
+ 30 yellow with black onion-dome
+ 30 dark green with white bear (?) head
+ 30 black with white hammer
+ 50 white with black numbers 0-9
+ 14 white with 1/2 red crosses
+ 15 white with some combination of green question marks / blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;CURE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
+ 1 white with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;PHASE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on it
* basic rules, advanced rules, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Revolution_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rules. See below.
* pad of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Kremlin Influence Sheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, not sure how many were used but there are a lot left
* various extra junk like a game and parts list from 1988, AH registration card, etc.
* LOTS of extra copies of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Revolution_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rules and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Kremlin Revolution Variant Influence Sheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s. These appear to be photocopies and are a little too big for the box, so their vertical edge is a little curled, and in turn they slightly curled the official rules (which do fit in the box without problem)
* the game board

    <notes>Basic game is punched and bagged, though no wear on anything. It has never been played. Even the box looks brand new.
Revolution expansion included and unpunched.
This AH 1st edition with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Gorbachev_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $26 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

This is in incredible shape. Aside from a touch of box wear the game is like new. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;influence sheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; has not been touched, the counters have not been punched and all the cards are still in one big perforated sheet waiting to be separated (see the pictures). Everything looks vibrant and brimming with Soviet Era freshness, even the Avalon Hill parts catalog is still in the box.

    <notes>Jolly Roger Games (JOL11917)
A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo. Players secretly influence politicians, using them to exile other players politicians, promote their own or wheel and deal. This is a re-envisioning of the Fata Morgana game and Avalon Hill licensed product from the mid-1980s.It will allow for three different eras (fictional, 1928, and modern) with politicians and events for each era. Each era has its own rules/foibles to make it slightly different than the others.</notes>

Like New in Shrink. 
Game sold from major retailer re-shrink-wraped. It looks brand new in shrink, and you could not tell it was a rewrap other than the label on the box. 
The shrink does have some tears from shelf life over the years, as I never opened or played it.

    <notes>KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE EDITION - includes all the special cards and slip case that only came with the kickstarter version.  Some of these have been missing a player aid and dice for each player, so I already made the effort to contact the publisher to get the extra aid and dice (just in case). 
MISB. Brand new in shrink. Game box in mint condition.
