   <description>Blimey! You and your blokes have been banished and stripped of everything but a few shillings and table scraps. Undaunted, you journey to a strange land to reinvent yourself and reclaim your honor. Will you farm the earth, fight as knights or finagle your own feudums?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Feudum (latin for fiefdom) is an economic medieval game of hand and resource management for 2-5 players. With many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in attempt to score the most victory points over five epochs._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in effort to rise in power._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s only the tip of the behemoth's horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious. Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes. Long live the King!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I need the money more than I need the game - up for sale is my pre-shipped Kickstarter pledge at the Feudum Friend level ($99 + 18.30). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve set the price only slightly higher than you would have paid at the time of the campaign. I have every expectation that the game will be both amazing and beautiful, but rent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gone up and that takes priority. Shipping has already been paid, and as such I can only ship domestically. I prefer payment methods that do not charge a fee to the buyer or seller, such as Venmo or Amazon.com gift card. PayPal offers a feeless payment system (Send Money to Friends - you can be the judge on whether applying this system to a BGG purchase is OK in your book), but if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to use Paypal Pay For Goods I would ask you to cover their fee. 
FEUDUM FRIEND - This limited-edition of Feudum is stamped in Foil and also upgrades 29 game pieces into wooden King Seals, Rosary Beads _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Archery Targets.</notes>

    <notes>Just opened the shrink-wrap to look at the board and read the rulebook. All other components have never been touched and markers are still in their punch-out  boards. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling because I will not have the time or gaming group to play this as much as I thought.</notes>
