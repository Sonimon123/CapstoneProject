It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the summer of 1985 and Soviet tanks stream into West Germany. Thinly spread NATO forces strive to delay the red hordes until reinforcements arrive, and the world watches anxiously, dreading the nuclear weapons held in each super power_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s arsenal. Welcome to the dark world of  Mark H. Walker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s World at War.  
 
A platoon level simulation that stresses command, control, and war_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unpredictable nature, World At War is an engaging, tactical action game. See About the Game, below to discover the unique mechanics that make this game so much fun. 
 World at War: Eisenbach Gap 
Charles S. Roberts Award Winner for Best Modern Era Game in 2007. 
World at War simulates, on a platoon-level, the war which began May 12, 1985 when Junior Lieutenant Yuri Andromnivitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s T-72 sent a 125mm HE round screaming into the guard tower on the ridge at Dankmarshausen, ripping mortar from rebar and sending head-sized chunks of concrete tumbling into the red-roofed houses below.  Units activate by chit draw and formation, fire in a flurry of dice, and look good doing it. The rules cover self-propelled mortars, thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons, ranged combat, opportunity fire, ATGM depletion, assault and overrun combat. Better still, World at War is not just a game, but also a game system. Learn Eisenbach Gap, and you can play any of the follow-on modules. See About the Game , below, for more details. The game ships in a box with the following components: 
 One hundred twenty eight (128) gorgeous die-cut 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters.

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the summer of 1985 and Soviet tanks stream into West Germany. Thinly spread NATO forces strive to delay the red hordes until reinforcements arrive, and the world watches anxiously, dreading the nuclear weapons held in each super power_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s arsenal. Welcome to the dark world of Mark H. Walker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s World at War. 
A platoon level simulation that stresses command, control, and war_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unpredictable nature, World At War is an engaging, tactical action game. See About the Game, below to discover the unique mechanics that make this game so much fun. 
World at War: Eisenbach Gap 
Charles S. Roberts Award Winner for Best Modern Era Game in 2007. 
World at War simulates, on a platoon-level, the war which began May 12, 1985 when Junior Lieutenant Yuri Andromnivitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s T-72 sent a 125mm HE round screaming into the guard tower on the ridge at Dankmarshausen, ripping mortar from rebar and sending head-sized chunks of concrete tumbling into the red-roofed houses below. Units activate by chit draw and formation, fire in a flurry of dice, and look good doing it. The rules cover self-propelled mortars, thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons, ranged combat, opportunity fire, ATGM depletion, assault and overrun combat. Better still, World at War is not just a game, but also a game system. Learn Eisenbach Gap, and you can play any of the follow-on modules. See About the Game , below, for more details.

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the new and improved Eisenbach Gap - Eisenbach Gap Deluxe. One game that includes all the components of both the original Eisenbach Gap and Death of First Panzer. The maps are mounted and the rules and player aid cards are full color. This is a great chance to dive into the popular World at War system with the first two modules packed in one box. Units activate by chit draw and formation, fire in a flurry of dice. The rules cover self-propelled mortars, thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons, ranged combat, opportunity fire, ATGM depletion, assault and overrun combat. Learn Eisenbach Gap Deluxe, and you can play any of the follow-on modules. Eisenbach Gap_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s six scenarios simulate the Soviet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s initial thrust into West Germany, pitting American against Russian, M1 Abrams against T-72. Death of First Panzer continues the story with a new map, new counters and six additional scenarios depicting the Bundeswehr_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s (The West German Army) desperate battle against the Soviet horde. </notes>

    <notes>Eisenbach Gap (LnL) - Complete and in very good condition. Also includes Death of the 1st Panzer expansion, which is also complete and in very good condition. Neither has been played and you can consider the counters punched, since they are falling out of the trees, and will probably all be out of the trees by the time you get it. The counters are all there, and placed in ziplock bags so they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t go AWOL. These are both First Edition copies, not the Deluxe Edition.

My late husband was an avid board gamer and collector.  He treasured all of his games and took excellent care of them.  If played, no food or drink was allowed near the game.  Games have been stored in non smoking household.  Please feel free to ask any questions.   Thank you!</notes>
