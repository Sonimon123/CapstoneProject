   <description>SPACE CRUSADE is a cooperative effort between Milton Bradley UK and Games Workshop.  It takes the role-playing elements from Milton Bradley's HEROQUEST and merges them with Game Workshop's dark vision of the future._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the manual...._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;One player must control the aliens.  This player is called the ALIEN PLAYER.  The other players control the three Commanders and their Space Marines.

    <notes>punched, but looks unplayed, really unplayed ! Excellent condition
It is in french but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m providing english rules on photocopies (from the original english rule book). Also, a translation for the cards + color scans of the original english cards, no french required at all. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m adding to set of extra missions etc. from the white dwarf magazines, 2 nice bonus.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling both expansions for SC, have a look !
Thanks</notes>

5 yellow marines with backpacks _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; various gun attachments with bases
5 red marines with backpacks and various gun attachments with bases
5 blue marines with backpacks and various gun attachments with bases (note - these blue marines have been about 3/4 painted with modeling paint - they look pretty good, actually)
4 large floor sections
4 long wall sections with door cutouts
various black clips for holding the wall _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; floor sections together
1 folded cardboard reference chart with plastic end pieces
1 large gray mech unit with 3 guns _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; base
a bunch of cardboard counters - green square ones, circular ones, and some to go into the command units
2 order recorders (yellow _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; blue) with plastic slides and spaces for 3 cardboard tokens (the plastic corner of one of these is cracked)

1 box with 3 split corners on the top (2 have been taped with masking tape); box bottom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; plastic insert are in good shape
The components that are present are generally in very good condition. A few of the extra weapons for the marines have broken pins so they can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be attached. There are at least enough weapons for every marine in all 3 colors. The long cardboard wall pieces have seen a lot of use and are creased in some places, but will still stand up fine.</notes>

    <notes>German edition.
When I was counting all the stuff I was missing 4 counters - but afterwards I had 4 counters left and I had no idea what these counters are for. So maybe it is complete. But maybe not.
I was not able to find out if the miniatures are complete. By number - yes - but they have removable weapons and there have been extra ones and I have no idea how many have to be in the game. Also no clue about the wallholders. There are some but I could not find out about them.
The box has two broken corners.
So there is no guarantee for this game - I did my best to count but had some problems - see above.
Shipping is 9.80 - wrapped only n paper, insurance 1.30$ optional.

    <notes>Checked abd all componants bagged. This has never been played - the deck of cards are still in cellophane - hence the Like New tag. However I did punch and construct the minis in a fit of youthful enthusiasm! The minis are glued to their bases, but all the weapons are separate.
The box is extremely good, with the most minor of shelfwear marks amounting to small corner rubs.</notes>

Some of the minis have been primed and some have been reasonably well painted and some are entirely unpainted.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve inventoried and it is missing one blue peg for the commander scanner.  One of the commander scanners boards has some cracking (more than just a small crack, but could easily be taped back together).  Includes 2 extra squads (of 5 each) of space marines with weapons, 2 extra blip tokens, some extra doors and door clips.  Missing the Dreadnaught box (just mixed in the main box).
Box top has split corners, bottom box has nice integrity.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve packed all the game materials up securely and it weighs in at 6 lbs 4 oz.  I will ship via USPS priority mail from 43202 and will ask for the cost of postage.</notes>

    <notes>Space Crusade COMPLETE INCLUDING MISSION DREADNOUGHT EXPANSION
The game is used, but well cared for. One Ultramarine has had the clip on Bolter snapped off (can be glued back in place, minimal impact on playability as although weapons are designed to be interchangeable, squads are required to have some marines armed with Bolters) - otherwise, all miniatures are included, none are damaged. One Chaos Marine has been part-painted, paint can be stripped with Dettol - otherwise all miniatures clean and unpainted.
All cards and counters included, with standard wear from careful use. Box is scuffed but intact. Box for Mission:Dreadnaught not included, but all components present.
UK shipping £7, international shipping please email for quote, but by all means take advantage of the weak pound and get yourself a bargain. Game will be bubble-wrapped and boxed and contents secured to prevent rattling and absolutely minimise risk of damage. Some form of insurance will need to be factored n to the postage costs - current (unconfirmed) guess is that US postage would be in the region of £20-£30
Photos can be provided, and probably will be posted up here shortly.</notes>
