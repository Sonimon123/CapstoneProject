   <description>Merchant of Venus uses many elements that come together to form a very interesting game. Players take on the roles of space traders who move their ships through interconnected systems discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities in a unique supply-and-demand system, their earnings can be used to purchase better ships and equipment (shields, lasers, engines, etc...) and construct their own spaceports (which speed up trading) and factories (which create better commodities). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat. The player who first acquires enough total value ($1000, $2000, $3000, $4000) in cash and port/factory deeds takes the day._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For the 2012 edition of Merchant of Venus from Fantasy Flight Games, the company promises that this revision _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;remains true to its magnificently campy core while updating the map and game components and expanding game play in surprising ways that will cause even the most hardcore fan to celebrate._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; That said, the player count has been lowered from six (in the Avalon Hill edition) to four, with the four races in the game being Human, Whynom, Qossuth, and Eeepeeep._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Another classic that returns in a gorgeous new edition. As always, the game is about exploring the galaxy and trading between the various alien races. Set up a profitable trading network and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re away. Great fun every time.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £41.67 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.
This game is over the 2 Kgs limit for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;small packets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (the cheapest way of sending parcels outside the UK), so I only expect to sell it in the UK. I charge postage at cost: £6.89 (myHermes, should take 2-3 days, with tracking).</notes>

    <notes>This game is in great condition, from an adult collector and smoke free home. It has had two games of play by me. I purchased from another gamer, but It did not appear to have been played prior to my plays. Pictures are available upon request. 
Only PayPal is accepted (unless local pick up is arranged, then cash is acceptable.) Shipping will be to US addresses only.  I will combine shipping if multiple games are purchased.  Typically I ship via USPS priority mail, but will ship FedEx for larger bundle for cost savings. Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Additional insurance can be include if requested.  
Local pick up in Thurston County WA is available upon request.
Please GM with any questions. Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Another classic that returns in a gorgeous new edition. As always, the game is about exploring the galaxy and trading between the various alien races. Set up a profitable trading network and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re away. Great fun every time.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £41.67 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.
This game is over the 2 Kgs limit for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;small packets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (the cheapest way of sending parcels outside the UK), so I only expect to sell it in the UK. I charge postage at cost: £6.89 (myHermes, should take 2-3 days, with tracking).</notes>

    <notes>This game was initially purchased during the Fantasy Flight Christmas Sale, as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ding and Dent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; item. One corner on the bottom edge of the box is notably crushed, but this is primarily cosmetic and the structural integrity of the box is unaffected.
The turn tracker piece is missing (it was tiny and likely a victim of cat tampering), but all other pieces are present and accounted for.  Apart from the box damage and this missing piece, the game is essentially new.
This also includes the Daedalus insert, assembled and in the box.  One part of the insert (covering the culture tokens and not required for setting up/playing the game) shows some warping, but does not significantly impact function.
Pictures furnished on request.</notes>
