   <description>Space Dealer is played in real time to a 30-minute soundtrack (or timer) with all players playing simultaneously. Players start at their own planet with a power generator and a mine. They race to generate goods and deliver them to each other (earning victory points for both the player and the recipient) or to the neutral planets. They can also do research to improve their abilities and bring new cards into play. Everything _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; from generating goods to moving ships,to playing new cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; requires at least one flip of a sand timer; the catch is that each player has only two timers!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of the game it seems like you have all the time in the world. Very soon, though, the game becomes a frantic race to make as many deliveries as possible!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A second copy of Space Dealer can be added to expand the game up to eight players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Direct bank transfer is the best way to pay.

    <notes>Real time space trading game. Make money by producing and delivering various goods. Different strategies are possible but made difficult by the use of sand timers. Game length is controlled by a cd which ramps up the tension by calling out the time remaining.Fun but chaotic(some gamers hate chaos-sigh!). shipping is parcel post prority mail is a little qicker and a little higher.</notes>

    <notes>First Edition. Only played a two times.
Since the original sand timers are not that great, I bought a new set from spielmaterial.de. They are much better then the timers that came with the game. I could include them in the game, but then the price increases by 5EUR.

    <notes>Includes the All-Zeit expansion and the base game. Publisher was Eggertspiele. Everything is in great condition but it has been played a few times. As expected, most timers don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t run in exactly 60s, actual time that each timer takes to run has been written on each timer.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>My husband was an avid gamer and board game collector.  He passed away and now it is time for me to find new homes for all his games.  He took excellent care of all the games, if they were played, no one was allowed to eat or drink while playing.  The games have been stored in a smoke free environment.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you!</notes>
