   <description>In Star Wars CCG, you take on the role of either the Rebellion or the Empire, and try to deplete your opponent's 'Life Force' by battling on the ground and in space._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the Star Wars Customizable Card Game (Star Wars CCG) players can choose from over 3000 different cards to build their own play deck consisting of 60 cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game went out of print in 2001 but an active Player's Committee keeps the game alive by producing new, free _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;virtual card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; expansions that are released frequently. You can 'customize' your deck by adding or removing cards between games to 'tweak' it._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player selects their deck of 60 cards in secret.  Cards are arrayed on a flat surface between the two players.  Location cards are laid out first and then characters or ships are laid out at the locations.  Additional types of cards can be placed on ships and characters, for example weapons and devices. The object of the game is to drain your opponent's life force.  Each card represents a unit of life force.  Playing location cards allows you to draw additional life force into your hand.  If a ship or character is destroyed in battle, the card goes to a lost pile; when all cards are in your lost pile you have lost the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a strategy based card game set in the Star Wars universe that can become very addictive.  It is a complex game that offers rewarding, strategic play for those who take the time to learn it.

    <notes>*Reserved for Toni*
One of my sons liked to collect these cards, as far as I know he never actually played the game.  There are approximately 1400 cards with many rares and from many different expansions.  I definitely know that he has the rare Darth Vader because I remember how excited he was when he bought that pack.  I have the box that is shown on this game page - the Premiere edition introductory two-player game.  My son made 2 decks (one light side, one dark side) and stored them in the box.  The original large rulebook (9 inches by 6 inches) is also still in the box.  There are also 2 limited edition 11-card expansion packs of Death Star II.  For some reason he opened them, then kept the cards in the foil.  I could tell you exactly which cards are in those 2 packs.  If you have any specific questions about individual cards, please email.  I have the cards stored in the plastic containers that are designed for these customizable card games.  I would secure the cards by sealing them in a plastic cover and then shipping them in these hard plastic cases with bubble wrap around them.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my collection of cards. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play this game and it makes me sad to just look at them. I can provide pictures and more details to any interested parties. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have anything super rare, but I have plenty of rares mostly from premiere up to cloud city. 
Includes near-complete light-side sets from Jabba_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Palace and Cloud City, so that means slave Leia and Captain Han Solo are in there. Lots of rares. I can provide the names of the cards that are missing from the sets.
The only cards missing from my light side sets from Jabbas palace and cloud city are:
Cloud city missing
Chewie with blaster rifle
Clouds (light)
Lando in millennium falcon
Lando with blaster pistol
Quiet mining colony
Z-95 be spin defense fighter
Jabbas palace missing
Agents in the court
Boushh
I must be allowed to speak
Jabbas palace: antechamber
Lando with vibro-ax
Master luke
Ounee ta
Palace raider
Racing skiff (light)
See-threepio
Seeking an audience
Stun blaster (light)
Tatooine: desert (light)
Tatooine: hutt trade route: desert
Underworld contacts
You can either profit by this...
That means there are a lot of rares included just in those two groups of cards. Here are checklists for those sets:

    <notes>The is my whole collection of SWCCG.
Three parts:
1. Sets in binders
2. Decks (lots of rare)
3. Spare (lots of rare)
(so, you u r interested in any of these, pls do not hesitate to ask, we could make arrangement, and do not be afraid of the shipment, the actual final could be much lower) pls keep reading:...
So, it includes an almost complete set of ALL of the sets. Starting from New Hope to the last Theed Palace.  I call it almost because I have not really count the number and border for them.  
Also, AI versions, Foils, and promos. 
All of the above mentioned cards are stored inside binders. They were not used for my game session.
And Next, the DECKs we used in games. Including tons of rare or foil. There are about 30 or more decks. All in good shape and always used with sleeves. (once we build a deck, we seldom break it down; but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mean we only have one Vader and one Vader deck, there is a lot of different theme decks in the collections)
And further next, assorted cards including rare and others. They are for deck buidling purpose. There is a lot. 
SO, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all. All these these groups of cards all in one HUGE LOT. 
If any one are interested, I will pick out the cards from binders protection. And then the DECKs, still in sleeves. 
It would be a very heavy lot. 
Pictures above showing all cards from 4 binders files, and 2 big boxes of decks and assorted cards. One box Episode 1, the other Ep 4-6. And you can see clear the cards are store in file set by set. e.g. Black border Vader can be find at the upper right set.

One of these decks in SEALED in shrinkwrap; the others have been opened and examined but are unplayed.  I bought these a long time ago but never played, and know nothing about the game - these have been sitting in a box all this time .

    <notes>PREMIERE (single deck starter  set, 60 cards, rule book)  In Star Wars CCG, you take on the role of either the Rebellion or the Empire, and try to deplete your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Life Force_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; by battling on the ground and in space.
In the Star Wars Customizable Card Game (Star Wars CCG) players can choose from over 3000 different cards to build their own play deck consisting of 60 cards.   This sealed deck contains a 60 card deck.
The game went out of print in 2001 but an active Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Committee keeps the game alive by producing new, free _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;virtual card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansions that are released frequently. You can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;customize_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; your deck by adding or removing cards between games to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;tweak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; it.
Cards are arrayed on a flat surface between the two players. Location cards are laid out first and then characters or ships are laid out at the locations. Additional types of cards can be placed on ships and characters, for example weapons and devices. The object of the game is to drain your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s life force. Each card represents a unit of life force. Playing location cards allows you to draw additional life force into your hand. If a ship or character is destroyed in battle, the card goes to a lost pile; when all cards are in your lost pile you have lost the game.</notes>

    <notes>Includes complete sets: Premiere through Endor.
Most of Death Star II (including Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight; no Emperor Palpatine, though), Reflections II, and Tattooine sets. And a good number of the Coruscant set.
A few cards are a little worse for wear, but most are in excellent condition.
Rates are organized by set and catalogued in a binder. Commons _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; uncommons are organized by card type and in plastic boxes. Plenty of extra copies of most cards.
Buyer pays shipping.</notes>

    <notes>A collection of approximately 4000-4500 cards from Premiere, A New Hope, Hoth, Dagobah, Cloud City, Jabba_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Palace, Endor, Death Star 2, Death Star 2, Special Edition, Tatooine, Reflections, and the Premium sets.  Purchased set from another collector, but only sifted through approximately 1/5 of the collection myself.  There are supposed to be rares, uncommons, commons within the set, but no guarantees as regarding content.  This would be a great _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;instant collection_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for anyone who is starting to collect.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a near complete set of the Star Wars Collectible Card Game.  There are complete sets of everything, except for the final 3 sets of the game that focused on the prequels, which were Tattooine, Coruscant, and Theed Palace.  All foils, legacy sets, special cards, and promos are included, minus those last 3 sets.
Also included with this lot is 2 5k boxes of cards that do include cards from those last sets, but I have not gone through them to determine what cards are still missing from those.
Each set comes in a binder, and the loose cards come in 5K boxes.  Shipping is going to be expensive for this lot, just a heads up.  I will try to mitigate how much it costs, but this is a very heavy lot.
I am open to other offers on this set and will entertain any serious offers.  PM me with your offers.</notes>
