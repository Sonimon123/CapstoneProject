   <description>In this light, fun family game, players race their paddleboats down the Mississippi, picking up passengers along the way.  But onboard coal supplies are limited, so each ship's acceleration and maneuvers must be carefully planned.  Perhaps most interestingly, the twists and turns of the river are unknown at the start of the game, and are only revealed as ships progress downstream._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Mississippi Queen: The Black Rose_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game PLUS The Black Rose expansion. Must sell together because of the extra player sticker that I was required to adhere to the original board.
PLEASE NOTE: When I bought the expansion, I made a black mark on the back of each expansion tile, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be able to distinguish them from those of the original set when returning them to their boxes.</notes>

    <notes>Box shows a little bit of wear and the bottom of the box is slightly dented.
Inside everything there and it looks like the game has hardly been played.
So the overall condition is rather very good than good, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want anybody to be disappointed.

    <notes>Very good condition, played only a couple of times.  All components are present and in super condition.  None of the smokestacks are broken, a common complaint as they are pretty easy to break.
This is the German Gold Sieber edition.  This game is 100% language independent, and the only German you will see is in the rules, easily fixable by downloading from here.
If you like this game, the expansion, The Black Rose, is absolutely a must.  Buy from me and save on shipping, in addition to my great prices :)</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande English version. Box shows some shelf wear on the edges, nothing serious. Game is complete and in great condition. Only one piece is slightly dinged; the cardboard measuring stick was bent. This was straightened but has a crease in the cardboard. I have never seen this stick used.</notes>

    <notes>Stunning condition, played only once.  There are no broken steamboats or missing pieces.  Extra stickers for the paddleboats are included, too.  This is the original Spielbox edition pictured in the default picture for this game.  The game is language independent, the only text is the rules, and those are easily found here.  I would be happy to include them in the game if you ask.  Shipping in the U.S. will not exceed $10.  Please check for shipping before buying if you live outside the U.S., I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like to confirm and then cancel sales.</notes>

    <notes>Comes with the Black Rose Expansion, which also is in good condition. The two games are together in the Mississippi Queen box, from which the insert has been removed. The Black Rose box is not included. The stickers from the Black Rose have been affixed to the appropriate boats and board space. A prong from the gray boat has broken off, but the games otherwise show almost no wear. The shipping charge to a US location is either the actual USPS priority mail rate for a 4 pound package from zip code 22801 or $10.35, whichever is less. International bidders contact me for information about shipping rates.

    <notes>Was only played twice - box has slight wear and a little crease on the bottom which is why this is in Very Good condition.  NOTE: This is the German edition - it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay as the components are language neutral, but I do want to mention it.  ALSO, the Black Rose expansion (which I am also selling) pier is adhered to one of the starting tiles.  The expansion allows for an extra player to play which is why the pier is affixed to the start tile.
Buyer pays actual shipping costs from San Diego.  Will combine with other games to save on shipping.</notes>

If you buy a used copy, it will probably have broken smokestacks.  I back up this guarantee with pieces from my personal copy.  This is the language-independent German edition by Gold Sieber. Ships from 96789, shipping to U.S. guaranteed not to exceed $10.

Box:  Light shelfwear with multiple dings, dents, and creases, including a serious corner crease on the box top that has resulted in an L-shaped split at the corner 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in one direction and 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in the other.  
Components:  Three of the boats have broken smokestacks, but this will not impact gameplay in any way.  Remaining components are complete and in excellent condition!  
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

If you tilt the tan boat just right, it shows a little glue residue from where the previous owner glued the smokestack. I did not notice it until I was asked to scrutinize that area. Not sure if any cleaner would remove it, but I am not going to try! :)</notes>

    <notes>Opened and played, in good condition (probably better, I want to be conservative in describing this game).  Measuring stick has a crease, all pieces accounted for, stickers on paddle wheels peeling from time so you will need to glue them back to secure them.  Box has shelf wear.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Mississippi Queen German first edition including the expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Black Rose_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, supporting 2 to 6 players.
There are some optical issues:
  - Box top is dented slightly
  - Box insert is missing completely
  - One stove is missing on the brown ship
  - Some stickers on the ships have gone off (replacement stickers still included)
  - The sticker containing the starting position for the 6th player has gone off (Starting position for the 6th player can be read in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Black Rose_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rules
  - Board tiles from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Black Rose_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion have been marked on the back 
Of these issues only the last one is gameplay relevant, as you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re seeing if the next tile is from the expansion or the base game.
Due to the missing insert, the content of the game will be padded inside the box before shipment.</notes>
