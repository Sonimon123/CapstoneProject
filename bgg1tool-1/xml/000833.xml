You take the role of either President Lincoln or President Davis and command the armies, promote and relieve generals, conduct amphibious assaults, dispatch cavalry raids, and even battle incompetency and political intrigue among members of your own cabinet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For the People includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The Confederate player can build ironclads, naval mines (torpedoes), submarines, conduct overseas purchases, and work towards foreign intervention. The Union player can build up his naval blockade, his ironclad fleet, fight draft riots, secure the Border States, and issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Relive the history of this exciting time when our nation was torn asunder._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE:     4 months per turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE:    6,000 men per strength point_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:    One or two_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COMPONENTS_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;420 full-color, die-cut counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 22x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mounted mapsheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;130 Cards [101 Kb pdf]_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;40-page Rule and Scenario Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Player Aid Card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Mark Herman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DEVELOPER: Mark Simonitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Rodger B.

The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(Note from Mark Herman:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;For The People_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is based on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Hannibal v Rome_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, but was my second game in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;We The People_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UPDATE:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook. This rulebook is available from GMT games as a free download._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The covering box is slightly dented in, which must_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve occurred during shipping. You can look at my picture of the game though and see it is still good.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 001106)
For the People is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War covering the conflict from Texas to Pennsylvania, from the firing on Fort Sumter to the end at Appomattox Court House. You take the role of either President Lincoln or President Davis and command the armies, promote and relieve generals, conduct amphibious assaults, dispatch cavalry raids, and even battle incompetency and political intrigue among members of your own cabinet. 
For the People includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The Confederate player can build ironclads, naval mines (torpedoes), submarines, conduct overseas purchases, and work towards foreign intervention. The Union player can build up his naval blockade, his ironclad fleet, fight draft riots, secure the Border States, and issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Relive the history of this exciting time when our nation was torn asunder.
2006 Edition Note: The 2006 version of For the People incorporates very few design modifications, but considerable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;clean up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; changes to the game rules. The biggest change from the 2000 version is the addition of twenty new optional playing cards to the deck, and a general rewording of many of the deck_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original cards. Players wishing to upgrade but not buy an entire new game may order the 2006 Edition card deck separately. The 2006 Edition rules are available as a free download from the Living Rules section of our website. Together, those two items encompass the vast majority of updates to the 2006 edition. </notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 001106)
For the People is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War covering the conflict from Texas to Pennsylvania, from the firing on Fort Sumter to the end at Appomattox Court House. You take the role of either President Lincoln or President Davis and command the armies, promote and relieve generals, conduct amphibious assaults, dispatch cavalry raids, and even battle incompetency and political intrigue among members of your own cabinet. 
For the People includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The Confederate player can build ironclads, naval mines (torpedoes), submarines, conduct overseas purchases, and work towards foreign intervention. The Union player can build up his naval blockade, his ironclad fleet, fight draft riots, secure the Border States, and issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Relive the history of this exciting time when our nation was torn asunder.
2006 Edition Note: The 2006 version of For the People incorporates very few design modifications, but considerable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;clean up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; changes to the game rules. The biggest change from the 2000 version is the addition of twenty new optional playing cards to the deck, and a general rewording of many of the deck_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original cards. Players wishing to upgrade but not buy an entire new game may order the 2006 Edition card deck separately. The 2006 Edition rules are available as a free download from the Living Rules section of our website. Together, those two items encompass the vast majority of updates to the 2006 edition. </notes>

CONDITION: Like new, contents mint, unused and complete, with unpunched counters and the cards are in their original shrinkwrap. The box has been laminated to protect it.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £11.50
Rest of World Postage: £22.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS:
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment.
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice.
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS:
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months! There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).
CUSTOMS:
Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.

    <notes>Second printing (2006).  Paper map (cardstock, not deluxe map).  Purchased second-hand and was never able to play.  Instructions are a bit wrinkled but passable.  The box is in rather good shape, but there is a bit of sag in the center.  The rest of the components are complete and in very good condition.  The chits and dice are stored in a GMT chit tray (included) and the cards are bound with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;magic tape_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. 
Kept in a smoke-free home.  Game ships USPS next business day (60543) after payment received.</notes>

    <notes>GMT 1st Edition + Deluxe Map + 2nd Edition Rules + 2nd Edition Card Upgrade = GMT 2nd Edition (counter tray holding all the counters included as a bonus!)
Condition: Excellent! Both maps and both sets of rules in pristine condition. Cards are virtually unused (if they were used, they would appear to have been sleeved).  Counters painstakingly inventoried and confirmed 100% complete.  Most counters look like they have just come off the sprue, though some have slight whitening at the edges.  Box has light shelf wear; notably, a small but noticable crease/line in top left of cover.

Shipping: the price I pay to Canada Post, FedEx, or UPS (your choice of company and method) is the price you pay. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge extra for handling or packing materials. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere in the world (yes, that includes Brazil)... but all buyers should be aware that I assume no liability for parcels when they leave my hands. Insurance recommended, particularly for international buyers.
Payment: I am an L5R addict, and I typically buy my booster boxes through CoolStuffInc, so I would prefer a CSI Gift Certificate. If the buyer would prefer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also accept Paypal, provided the buyer covers any fee that may apply.
Miscellaneous: BGG will receive its 3%, of course. Item will ship within 3 days of payment clearing. Any questions, please feel free to PM!</notes>

    <notes>Very good, punched, played once
Box: Very good; no burst corners; minor shelf wear on corners and bottom edge
Map: Very good; wrinkled around folds, but believed due to rather poor paper used by GMT
Counters: Punched; 426 counted, so perhaps some extras from C3i?
Cards: Verified complete; in good quality card sleeves
Extras: Counters (10 unpunched) and Naval Card Complex Variant Effects sheet from Cr2 #23; original 2 dice
Weight: 1lb 14oz
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m prepared to listen to an offer, and would be more likely to consider if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying several game. Low-ball offers are likely to be ignored.
*** All games on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; list will be listed eventually - feel free to look through them and make offers ***
Shipping is done from 33947 via USPS Priority or Ground service, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to keep your costs down using Flat-rate and Regional-rate boxes if that works out cheapest. If you want a rough estimate of the shipping cost use the calculator at usps.com. Total the weight of all the games, then add a lb or two for the box plus packing materials. I ship to mainland US addresses only. (A couple of bad experiences.)
Payments via personal PayPal transfers are preferred (extra charged for cover any fees), but checks, money orders, cash, and other options considered. 
Not looking for any trades at this point, but may consider 18xx games.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for a copy of For the People (2nd printing) by GMT Games.  Game is in acceptable condition based on BGG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s policy.  All components are in great shape, counters are sorted in a GMT sealable tray.  Game is missing the rulebook, which is available on BGG or GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s site.  Box is slightly worn.
Buyer agrees to pay $13.65 for shipping via USPS Priority Mail in a Medium Flat Rate box.  I only accept Paypal for payments and only ship to the US.
If you have any questions, please ask!</notes>

    <notes>My copy of For the People is punched.  Please geek mail me if you would like photos or have questions about the game.
Buyer will pay shipping and packaging costs (not my time, but the box and bubble wrap).  If you have a shipping preference, geek mail me and let me know.
Also, I live in the 21209 zip code (Baltimore, MD), so let me know if you would prefer to pickup the game and save us both time on shipping.</notes>
