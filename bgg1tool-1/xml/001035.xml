   <description>A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s last veteran nco_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;all thoughts the advance abandoned with the stunned demise or their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat of been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire against your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armour assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armoured advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows you own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Design You Own_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters or real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles of 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armoured warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Be forewarned!

    <notes>Game is complete and in excellent condition. This copy has the 4th edition rules. Pictures available upon request.
I also have two other copies, both 2nd Edition. One 2nd edition box is shot, the other has a dirty box, but the box is pretty intact. I also have a Cross of Iron which got all mixed up with it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s corresponding SL(my own copy from long ago), and is certainly missing some pieces, (either the COI or SL don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t know which). I also currently cannot find the COI rules. If you are interested in either of these other copies, let me know, and I will search for the rules some more, as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;m sure they are around somewhere. Obviously the second _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is to be sold as a set, as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s jumbled together.</notes>

    <notes>Part of a package deal, each the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;best_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (final) edition of its release:
1) Squad Leader 4th Edition (more than complete copy, has about 3 or 4 copies of the game worth of counters neatly organized)
2) Cross of Iron 4th Edition: Complete, unpunched!
3) Crescendo of Doom (1st/only edition): Complete, unpunched!
4) G.I. Anvil of Victory: Complete, Unpunched!
Also included are some extra scenarios found elsewhere.
the total for all of this is $100+ $28 shipping withint he US (These are *very* heavy altogether, particularly with GI Anvil of Victory)
The games are not available for individual purchase. The reason they are listed this way:
Unfortuantely, BGG doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t allow more than one game to be listed as one package for sale, so each game is listed at its appromixate cost within the set. I listed them this way, ebcause last time I wrote down the price of a full set of a game and its expansions under only one game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s title, someone saw the price on the sales page, didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look at the description, and flamed me for wanting so much for just one game (even those it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just one game). The prices work out to:
Squad Leader: $10
3 expansions, each one new/unpunched:$30 each
While most items can be sent overseas, shipping for this package is within the US only, unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re willing to wait quite a while for finding out the exact shipping charges overseas.</notes>

    <notes>Squad Leader, Cross of Iron, Crescendo of Doom, GI: Anvil of Victory bundle. They have to be sold as a bundle due to the way the counters are bagged (see below).
Counters:
1. I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all there -- I added the counts from the backs of the boxes, and it turns out to be something like 4,500 counters for all 4 games. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no way I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to count all those! :D
2. All the counters are in bags, sorted according to nationality, _not_ according to game. Here is the breakdown per bag:
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #1...CoD, GI: British
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #2...CoD, GI: German
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #3...SL - GI: Russian
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #4...GI: USA
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #5...SL: All (German, Russian, Minor)
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #6...CoD, GI: French and Minor
--_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Bag #7...SL - GI: Miscellaneous
3. The counters look to be in very good to excellent shape. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to look at all of them, but what I can see looks good.
Now, onto the individual games:
Completeness: all the maps, quick reference cards, rules, and scenarios are present. The whole set comes with 3 dice (2 white, 1 red).
SQUAD LEADER:
Box: Dished, much edge-wear/shelfwear, corners intact
Rules: Worn, marked, cover coming loose.
Scenarios: Stapled, slightly dog-eared
Quick reference cards (CRTs, etc.) : Good
Maps (4 total): Flat, very good condition except that one map has a 1-1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long split along the back edge at the seam, but the front side (map side) is still intact.
CROSS OF IRON:
Box: Flat. As in, flat like a pancake. There is one intact corner on the whole thing.
Rules: Worn, marked, cover is loose.
Scenarios: Stapled, good condition.
Quick reference cards (CRTs, etc.) : Slight creases.
Map (1): Flat, very good condition.
CRESCENDO OF DOOM (overall, the newest looking of the bunch) :
Box: Shelfwear, fading. All corners intact.
Rules: Good condition, marked with errata.
Scenarios: Stapled, good condition.
Quick reference cards (CRTs, etc.) : Very good condition.
Map (2): Flat, very good condition.
GI: ANVIL OF VICTORY
Box: Dished. One corner/edge is heavily worn. All corners intact.

Scenarios: Stapled, good condition.
Quick reference cards (CRTs, etc.) : Slightly worn around the edges.

Map Overlays: Good condition.

Full details of the combined Squad Leader set
Boxes: Boxes included for SL,COI,GIAOV all in reasonable condition, significant amount of storage wear and a number if corner have been fixed with clear tape but they are still perfectly serviceable
Reference cards: 8 in total, although there is no clearly identification, I think that one pair from each game
Rules: All four sets of rule some notes in them, generally good condition though the front sheet on GIAOV is loose
Maps: Although these don’t follow in sequence you’ll have to take my word for it they are a full set for SL,COI and GIAOV Maps 1,2,3,4,5,8,12,13,14,15 (original COD maps are missing but good quality full colour laser copies are included [maps 5,6]).. All in very good condition with the exception of Map 4 that is starting to split on the fold (but still quite usable).
Counters: 
SL is 100% complete
COI is missing 26 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters from 576 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 137 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters from 520
COD is missing only one 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters.
GIAOV is missing 2 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters from 528 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 309 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; counters from 1040
Scenario cards: Full compliment of cards (2 are copies on same weight card) for scenarios 1-47
Overlays: – Full set A,B,C..O (A,K are copies on card)
Dice – 2 standard Avalon Hill D6
Note: I’ve left in the scans of the counter sheets that I checked them against so you can see exactly what ones are missing.

    <notes>The box is the worst aspect.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s structurally OK, but is taped a bit and is shelfworn.  Maps are fine.  Counters are punched and bagged, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s complete.  A fine playable copy, definitely not for collectors.
The actual weight might vary slightly after packing; I just give an honest guess, in this case 4 pounds.  I ship via USPS from zip 80015.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing or handling, and will use the lower of Flat Rate ($9.30 now, but it creeps up now and then) or Priority Mail, or Parcel Post if you prefer.

    <notes>My never played 4th Edition Copy of Squad Leader.  This is the latest edition with all the errata and the nicer textured brown backed mounted mapboards.  All game components listed on the box are present.  The scenario sheets are still unseparated.  The countersheets were unpunched but a few rows have fallen out over the years so those pieces are in sepearate baggies (not pictured).  Not that it should really matter but you can tell the game has never been played because the only punched american or russian counters are the russian _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; that fell out no troops.  One German Leader (the almost never used lowely 8-0) somehow got swapped with my played copy of the game I sold over a decade ago.  So it IS included but is a lot more worn than the otherwise crisp components.  The box itself has no split corners and is pretty tight.  There is shelfwear on all sides.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t consider it too bad at all for its age but opinions always very on that.  Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t imagine much nicer of a copy of 4th Edition Squad Leader unless it was kept in shrink or otherwise packed away since purchase.</notes>

    <notes>Third edition of the rules booklet.  The game boards are in excellent shape, the book is in good shape with just a little bit of grime on the first page (not enough to obscure any text).  The scenario cards and reference cards are still bound together and not separated. The box is intact but shows shelf wear including scuffed edges but is not blown out.  I have no idea if all the chits are there.  There are far too many to count, but since I stopped playing this I really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t believe much if any could possibly be missing.</notes>

    <notes>Game was found in a used book store. Box has wear along the bottom edge and the beginnings of a split corner. All counters are present, punched, and in good condition. The rules booklet looks good, the reference/scenario cards are still bound together, and the boards look great. Probably was played only a few times, if at all (since the reference/scenario cards are still bound together).

    <notes>Game is in generally good condition.  Punched, played, some very minor wear on components.   Box top has two split corners and extensive shelf wear.  The game is not verified complete, but I have no reason to believe it is not.  For only $20, you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t go wrong with making a replacment chit or two, IF something is missing!  4th edition rules with a couple of dog ears.  Nothing major, but this is not a collectors copy.    </notes>

It was up in the attic for many years, but I finally figured I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pull it down and sell or trade.  (Yes, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to trades, too.)
Entire game present and accounted for.  Some counters still attached to each other, never punched.  All counters sorted in Plano boxes.  Please specify whether you want the Plano boxes or not.  (I have no use for them, but they might [or might not] add to the shipping costs.)</notes>

Boards and pieces are in good condition.  Fourth edition rules.  The box is beat up.  Two of the corners of the box bottom are taped and the inside is stained.  The top of the lid shows a good amount of shelf wear and the lid is noticeably dished.
Postage will be at most the cost of a medium flat rate priority box.  Postage will be cheaper if shipped parcel post or if regular priority mail from 30809 costs less.

    <notes>The 2nd edition Squad Leader.  Note to ASL bubbas:  these counters are NOT ASL, they are SL.  Have the counters seen in the photos-i.e. German/SS/Finn. For completeness gamers/collectors, I am also offering the box and counters for Cross of Iron, and GI Anvil of Victory elsewhere on BGG.  If you want all three, PM me and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll talk. 
Finally for folks outside US and Canada:  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not in the business of mailing stuff and working customs forms.

    <notes>Why so much for a Squad Leader in just Good condition? Because this item comes with the CROSS OF IRON expansion gamette. Both are second edition games, and a simpler game overall than ASL. This is a well played copy owned by a player careful with his games.
Boxes show some wear and each have had a corner repaired with clear packing tape. Counters are cut and zip-locked, maps are clean, play aids are sharp and mostly unmarked. Components are Very Good overall. SL rules show some wear but have suffered no tears or dogears. COI rules are Very Good.
I will insure the item, if requested, for an additional $5
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H of $12 is for US addresses only.
I am willing to ship worldwide if you are willing to pay the international shipping charges.</notes>

    <notes>There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just a whole lot of Squad Leader going on here. More than I really want to deal with and that means BIG SAVINGS for you!.
I got this as part of a lot of board games and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know that much about Squad Leader. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s five boxes of Squad Leader stuff and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bit much to fully sort and catalog for me. It contains, I believe, 2, possibly 3 full copies of Squad Leader plus the Cross of Iron expansion and the Crescendo of Doom expansion. There might even be more.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s less than $15 a box, The two expansions ALONE will cost you $65. If you know enough about Squad Leader or similar war games to sort the pieces out this is a good deal.
The boxes have some edge wear but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re sturdy. The pieces are punched and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a ton of them, but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t guarantee 100%.
Will accept cash checks or money order. You can pay with PAYPAL if you also pay the Paypal transfer fee as calculated by _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;thefeecalculator.com_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.</notes>

    <notes>This game I’d say is near mint.  Box:  no discoloration, minimal shelf wear; very good.  Instruction manual: near mint; no signs of ever being opened, no age spots, tears, wrinkles, etc.  Dice both present and near mint.  Pieces: unpunched, near mint.  Scenario book with quick reference data cards: Near mint, with the exception of some slight age discoloration on first page; all pages still attached to each other, no tears, rips, etc.  All four boards: near mint.  Game still has original near mint advertising pamphlets with it.  
Will consider reasonable offers.
Unless requested by purchaser, will ship by least expensive means.</notes>

    <notes>Partially punched and complete except missing one German satchel charge counter for which I have crafted a replacement counter. I can provide photos of the counters laid out on a table to compare with the images on BGG. Map boards, charts and box are in very good condition other than some minor shelf ware on the bottom of the box. I estimate economy shipping at about $5 to $6. More for priority shipping or to Canada of course. I can provide a better estimate with a zip code. Will combine shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Bought used, but never played. Counters are half-punched, looks like original owner never played, or rarely. Loose counters organised in envelopes, unpunched counters of course still on sprues. Rulebook, charts, and maps all very clean. Box scuffed but solid. Overall, a very nice used copy [though I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t guarantee every piece is here because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s partially punched - but pretty sure they are.] Happy to answer further email inquiries.
