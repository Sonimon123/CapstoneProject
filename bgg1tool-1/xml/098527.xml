   <description>The land of Kilforth is a perilous domain filled with nefarious monsters, mysterious Strangers and treacherous Locations, and dominated at its centre by The Sprawl, a huge city where intrepid Heroes begin their journey to fame and fortune. Throughout the land various factions vie for power over each other, such as the supposedly noble Order of the Rose or the terrifying Doom Guard. And presiding over the world outside Kilforth is the ever-present Overlord, Masklaw. Over the coming month, a deadly Gloom will descend upon Kilforth,which the Heroes must Battle through to prove their worth, defeat an Ancient evil, and save the land from darkness._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Gloom of Kilforth is a card game of high fantasy with a Gothic edge, playable in 1-3 hours, where 1-4 players, working individually or together, must take their humble adventurers on a journey through a dark world of magic and peril. They will visit strange places, stranger people and overcome powerful enemies in their mission to discover mysterious artefacts and mystical Spells. Players follow their Hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s tale from modest beginnings through an epic story to an exciting climactic battle for the fate of the world. Gloom of Kilforth takes about 45 minutes per player to play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Awards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gloom of Kilforth was awarded one of the Top Ten Games of 2017 by Tabletop Gaming Magazine._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>A brand new copy of Gloom of Kilforth signed by the game designer Tristan Hall at the game launch party.
In shrink wrap, which has been carefully opened at one end to allow Tristan to sign the game box. Shrink wrap still intact on every part of the box except the one end/small side that has been signed.
Will include 2 double-sided postcard-sized promos showcasing some of the art of GoK (both sides shown in the 2nd image).
Game is not only in shrink wrap, but still in the bubble wrap it arrived in - just opened at one end for signing.</notes>
