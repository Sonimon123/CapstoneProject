   <description>Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;mission_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Similar to:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Steam_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game and box are in really great shape.  The board did come damaged...the three sections all got dented on the same corner.  It is not really noticeable when the board is unfurled in all its glory unless you are looking for it.  
Game is very heavy- about 7 pounds, so shipping will be a little pricey.  I will pack it carefully and insure it.</notes>

    <notes>Game is Like New, well taken care of.  Played a few times.  Box has minimal wear on outside (small linear scratches on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;plastic film_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; that covers the box).  Components are in excellent condition.  Map has small areas ( less than 1/2 cm) of minimal fading (it came like that probably from shifting around in the box...check the old forum posts regarding this).  Map has no warping.
Thanks for looking!  </notes>

    <notes>Opened and played twice.  This IS the Eagle Games USA version, NOT the international version.  The game is in excellent condition.  If I remember correctly, there might be a slight issue with one board section being slightly misaligned.  I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t experience warping to any great degree, but I only played it once or twice.
I do combine shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games 2005 International English Edition. 
Played 3 times in our non-smoking home. Box looks great but on closer inspection it has two 2-inch-wide areas where the box is pushed in about 4 millimeters, but the strong box with linen finish is not split and does not seem weakened there. Otherwise, everything in excellent condition. 
(Regarding production problems with this edition that some mention in the forums: This board is nice and flat. The purplish-blue color looks different on the board vs. the cubes, but is not ambiguous with any of the other colors.)
SHIPPING:
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   USA: $12.70 shipping in USA.
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica, MA, USA.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering. For this very heavy and large game, it will be expensive.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS loses or damages the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: If you can provide your email address, you may pay by credit card via Google Checkout.  Or you may pay by PayPal to karlhanf@comcast.net , or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>The game is opened and punched. I think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played a total of three times. Box seems to be near pristine, but ask for pics if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re anal about such things.
Read up on the infamous boards. They warp and the warpage varies depending on where you are. If you buy my game don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t complain about the warping boards. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been warned.
Otherwise, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not much else to it. I can provide pictures on request of whatever detail you obsess about. I got Steam and only have room for one train game.</notes>

Nice shape, played a few times. Should be a 9 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might go to 10 pounds after after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship by USPS Priority Mail (this game won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit into the Flat Rate boxes, unfortunately).

    <notes>This copy of Railroad Tycoon has never been played.  This is the original Eagle Games English-language everything printing.
All pieces have been accounted for (that took quite a while to do!!)
All of the track tiles/new city tiles/western link tiles are unpunched.  The engine cards are still unpunched.  The money bills are still in shrinkwrap.
The share cards are no longer in shrinkwrap (all accounted for).  The tycoon/railroad operations cards are no longer in shrinkwrap (all accounted for).
The empty city card bag has been opened.  Each of the six train bags has also been opened.
There is one extra blue train (broken but replaced by Eagle Games).
The three boards appear in fine shape.  There doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear to be any warping (as of 10/23/09).
The outside game box is in excellent condition.  On the lower right corner of the game box top, there is a small bit of scrunching.  Barely noticeable.
This game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;international edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of Railroad Tycoon, with some of the text on the game being French.  While some of the text on the game board itself is in French, the game comes with English reference cards, so the foreign language really has no effect on the game whatsoever!
The game itself is in great shape, the paper money is still in plastic shrink and a plastic tray for storing the track tiles is included!  Please geekmail me with any questions.  Thanks!</notes>

This item will ship via UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion.  Due to the weight, size, and shipping costs increases, shipping for this item will be $16.00
As an aside, I also have Railways of Europe and Railways of England and Wales available (please message me if interested).  Purchase of these items would not increase the shipping costs.  I do not have a box for Railways of Europe.  It was combined in the main box (which I will pull out if not purchased with it.</notes>

No box shelfwear as the top half of the shrinkwrap was never removed from the box. Blue cities have matched removable labels that make their color more distinguishable from purple. Includes separate Income/Score track created by me for BGG.
Payments by paypal must add $3 plus 3%. Personal checks must clear before shipment. Contact me before for shipments outside the USA/Canada. Only actual shipping charged. (I have large boxes and packing material.)</notes>

    <notes>Game is heavy,  so within the UK it will cost £7.  Outside the UK will be very expensive (unless you combine this with other games).
The box and contents are in great shape.  I never got an insert, so I made my own using foam - the components fit more snugly than they ever could in the original.  I also include a separate foamboard-mounted score track.  Also included are tuckboxes for the cards.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve already applied the replacement city stickers.  Player aid printouts are there too.</notes>

    <notes>Railroad Tycoon
2005 International Edition
Every component of the game has been checked and accounted for.
All components have been kept sealed in plastic bags since purchase. 
The board has never been used as I only ever played this game with the Rails of Europe expansion a couple of times. Despite this the board has a few very slight scuffs. The cards have never been used either and are mint.  Despite being lightly played with a couple of times the money, shares and engine cards are in excellent condition too, they look unused. All other components are mint.
The box has had a split corner in the past but was neatly repaired.
From a pet and smoke free home.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve upload pictures so you can see for yourself. 
I also have the Rails of Europe expansion that is in ‘As New’ condition. I would consider throwing this in for a little more, if you are interested.</notes>

    <notes>Eagle Games edition.  Opened and played a few times, in excellent condition. Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $10.00 (super heavy box).  If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Railroad Tycoon English edition, Eagle Games. Played only 1-2 times and all components are included and in good condition. The only reason for listing in only Good condition is that there is some minor denting to the box and slight edge wear to a couple of the boards.
Buyer will pay actual shipping costs. The weight will probably will be about 8.5 lbs (this is a heavy game!) so these may be fairly high depending on where you live. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to check in advance, my zip code is 55416 and I will likely use Priority Mail.

    <notes>This is the original Railroad Tycoon edition from 2005.
Tiles have been punched, and the game has been played a couple of times.   I look and other than the some of the dollar bills not being perfectly flat (like you would see with unused money), I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice any signs of wear on the game components or the box. Because the tiles are punched I personally wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t rate this as like-new.
This will be a heavy box to ship, so please send me your zip code and I will send you a shipping estimate.  Because it is so heavy, shipping outside the US will have to be US priority which will be expensive, probably more than the cost of the game.</notes>

    <notes>Railroad Tycoon!  Multi-lingual version. Only a few plays on this copy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; correspondingly the components are like new;  The board shows no warping.  The box shows no shelf wear, but did suffer odd damage to one corner that resulted in a tear (carefully repaired with tape).  Box damage appears to be from another box pushing into it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; appears minor.  As common for the multilingual edition: the language on the board and the shares appears to be Spanish, but the cards / player aids are in English.  
Please note this is a big, heavy box that won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in any of the standard USPS flat rate boxes.</notes>

    <notes>Edition: This is the 2nd edition revised reprint published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.
Condition: Complete and undamaged. Opened, carefully bagged but never played. 
Bonus Item: This sale includes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Railways of the World: Event Deck_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which can be added to the Railways of the World base game or any of that game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expansions to put a new spin on rail-building. The Event Deck includes more cards than players will use during a single game, so no two games will play out the same way. Instead of drawing randomly from the deck, players can build their own custom decks, from a vicious deck packed with negative events to a bountiful deck filled with positive events. The deck can be tweaked for each of the expansion maps, and four blank cards are included for players who want to create their own events.

    <notes>Railways of the World bundle.  Base game box indicated printing in 2012 so I am assuming this is the second edition.  This is for the base game, Railways of the World as well as the expansions, Railways of Great Britain and Railways of Europe as well as the Events deck expansion.   All of the components are included in the base game box and the Railways of GB box (no Europe box).  Components are punched, organized but unplayed, like-new condition from a smoke free home.   Boxes may have some minor scuffing and white corners but are in excellent condition.   Total weight for this set is approximately 16 pounds.  Depending on location, the likely cheapest shipping option will be FedEx Ground unless you are relatively close to NJ.  If it is less expensive, I also ship by USPS Priority Mail.  Buyer to pay for shipping and pay pal fee.</notes>

    <notes>RIALWAYS of the EASTERN U.S. version - does not have a separate listing on BGG.  Not the full game!
This is the new EASTERN U.S. map and scoreboard, along with some instructions.  This was available from Eagle-Gryphon games when they came out with the new Railways of the World to replace Railroad Tycoon.  This is the new Eastern U.S. map with the separate mounted scoreboard!  
A great addition for the owners of the older Railroad Tycoon version.</notes>

Only reason I listed as Good instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is because the two edges of the box bottom are split (see image)
This is too big for a flat rate box so shipping will need to be quoted separately from 30066.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition - has only been played a handful of times, and has been well looked after and carefully stored. All components are in excellent condition - the U.S. card deck is still in shrink - but the box inner has some very minor wear around the top corners.
Postage will be £6.00 within the U.K. - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a hefty game! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very happy to combine shipping on multiple items - please message me for an estimate.</notes>
