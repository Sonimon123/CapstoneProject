   <description>This earlier Master Labyrinth is very different than the 2007 dragon-themed Master Labyrinth._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, this game is based on the simpler, original Labyrinth game. It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game was received in a trade and looks to be in fine condition and has never been played by me.
Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, This game is based on the simpler The aMAZEing Labyrinth game. It is played on a board with maze tiles (Straight_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, L_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, and T_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s) arranged on it. Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns. Players are wizards-in-training and they are charged with running around the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard. The trick is that the two chip cannot be taken until the one chip is taken, and the three chip cannot be taken until the two chip is taken, etc. Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient. Once all twenty-one items have been taken, the highest total score wins. But the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; part of the game gives each player three ingredients which will give the player bonus points for grabbing.</notes>

Shipping time within Canada and the US
Expect 2 to 7 days, depending on distance from Montreal, QC. If you are on the West Coast, expect about 7 days for the package to reach you.
Shipping within Canada
There is only one parcel category, and cost varies between $12 and $20 for 1 game, depending on area and weight. Add $3 to $5 for each additional game.
Shipping to the US
When shipping to the US from Canada, there are three parcel categories, those being small, medium and large. The cost is based on overall area (Length x Width x Height), which is then multiplied by weight. The Canada Post calculator can be found here:
http://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/far/personal/farUS?ex...
Shipping examples:
Shipping a single game costs between $16 (Medici vs Strozzi) and $25 (standard FFG box size) for the first game, then add $3-5 dollars per game, depending on size _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; weight.</notes>

==============================================
The games I am selling come from my personal collection. I often have bought games used or traded for them. I will do my best to accurately describe their condition. I will confirm completeness in most cases (unless stated otherwise) but not for items that come in large quantities for which a few missing will make no difference (like stacks of paper money for example). Please note that I am not concerned about inserts and may have removed them from a game that I felt didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them. I might not think to mention that in the description. If you are interested in the insert, please ask.
Note that our home is smoke-free but not pet-free. I can not guarantee the complete absence of cat hair in the boxes
I prefer to ship via USPS Priority. I use non-Flat Rate boxes unless it will save you money for me to use Flat Rate boxes. I buy the postage on-line and charge the exact cost to the buyer. I am happy to combine multiple items to save you on shipping
I have perfect feedback here on BGG. On ebay, where I am selling my record collection, I am ronattic, and have 100% positive feedback. So please buy with confidence.</notes>
