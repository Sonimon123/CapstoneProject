   <description>From the designer of Star Fleet Battles, Federation Commander is the fast moving game of starship combat in the Star Fleet Universe.  Mounted game boards, laminated full color ship control cards and gorgeous full color counters highlight this re-imagining of the Star Fleet Universe with 21st century production values._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This was the initial product for Federation Commander, and was the original base set.  There are other base sets and expansions for the Federation Commander Series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Much effort has gone into streamlining the game - there are 8 impulses rather than 32.  One die roll allocates up to 10 points of damage, rather than 2 dice per damage point that strikes the ship.   Color coded charts and ship cards reduce the mental overhead of remembering what goes where._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gone is the tax form of energy allocation, replaced by a free flowing dynamic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;on the fly_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; power allocation system.  Maneuver has had countless special cases removed and streamlined._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is not an introduction to Star Fleet Battles, but a re-imagining of starship combat in the Star Fleet Universe, redesigned from the ground up to appeal to a wider audience and reduce rules lawyer-ism._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Included in the rules are the 'free form_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (hexless) movement rules that have been in use for years; the hex map is scaled for miniatures bases, and the game is designed to be easy to port over to miniatures adaptations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

New captains are sent to fight pirates. Bold captains are sent to fight Klingons. Are You a Bold Captain?
New Game Value: Everything is designed for FAST play and to allow players to learn the game in under an hour. The dynamic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Pay as you Go_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; energy system does not bog down game play. Damage allocation is done by a fast _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;one die_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; system.
This product does not require any other products for use. All other Federation Commander products will work with Romulan Border or Klingon Border.
Components: 60-page Rev-4 rulebook, 216 half-inch and 40 one-inch full color die cut playing pieces, two full-color double-sided laminated player reference cards, sixteen full color double-sided laminated ship cards, six 8.5x11 hard-mounted double-sided map panels, two dice, paperclips for energy track, wipe-off marker.
Improvements over earlier editions of Klingon Border: Higher-quality map panels, real wipe-off marker, and the latest revision rulebook with all updates integrated. Who will buy it? Veterans of Star Fleet Battles, players of Federation Commander: Romulan Border, fans of Star Trek, and fans of miniatures starship games.

Huge lot of what was originally 31 differently sold items.
Some items were consolidated, in particular a lot of the counters into counter trays and the ship displays (some counters are in the tray, some still on the original countersheets). Included is a counter tray, and some plastic slider bits to help keep track of info, and a plastic bin to hold the counters and ship displays.
1. Klingon Border base set (complete, though the original rulebook has wear from reading)
2. Romulan Border base set (complete, though the rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cover was misprinted a bit, but the inside is fine)
3. Megahex module H1 - new
4. Space Battle Maps Captians Module W
5. Romulan Attack
6. Klingon Attack
7. Tholian Attack
8. Battleships Attack!
9.-12. Captians Logs 32,33,34,and 35 (first 4 Fed.Commander issues iirc)
13.-31. Ship display booster packs 0-18. 0 was for some protype rules. All cards for 1-18 are included, though packs 7-9 are missing just the little cover sheet that says booster packs 7-9 (no game info lost, it was just a cover sheet that the ship displays were put in. the inside of the sheet was blank. Booster packs 16-18 are all still in the shrink.

    <notes>Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB4001)
The new fast-paced starship combat game for a new generation of gaming! Everything is designed for simplicity, lack of clutter, and fast play. One die roll resolves ten points of damage. Ship diagrams are color coded. Energy allocation is done on the fly. There are only eight fire-decision steps per turn. Boxed product, includes 40 full-color 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; playing pieces with full color CGI art, plus 216 full-color 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ammunition and tracking markers. Also includes 16 full-color laminated ship diagrams (no photocopies needed). Each is printed on both sides, with the full-size squadron-scale ship on one side and the faster-playing fleet-scale ship on the other side. There are two laminated full-color player reference cards with the charts needed for play, dice, a wipe-off marker, and some paperclips. There is a 52-page illustrated rulebook in larger size type. Includes a six-panel full-color mounted map board with 1.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hexes on one side and 0.625_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; hexes on the other side. (There are starship playing pieces of both scales.) This is the first _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;building block_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in the new Federation Commander game system. Klingon Attack is an expansion adding more ships, scenarios, and maps. The booster packs provide extra ships (and some new ones). Squadron Boxes 1+2+3 provide one miniature for each type of ship in Klingon Border. Border Box 1 provides 24 miniatures (filling out the complete set of 40 that matches the game and boosters 1+2+3). </notes>

    <notes>A few years back, I thought I would get back in to the wargames of my youth, including SFB...
Anyway, this is Rev 4 of Klingon Border.  Game is opened.  Game pieces have been punched (sorted, and stashed in baggies).  Game has otherwise never been played and has been pretty much just stashed in the closet.  So much for going back to the wargames of your youth.
So you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking at a complete game in great shape where the pieces have been punched out for you.  Even includes the two remarkably-small d6 ... hey ADB, think you could have found SMALLER dice?
Shipping is your choice, but the listed price does NOT include shipping, which will be worked out after the sale.  This is fairly hefty game, just a warning.  
(Most games can fit in a USPS Priority Shipping medium box, which costs $12.65 to ship.)</notes>

    <notes>Complete* and in very good condition - only played with a couple of times.
I also have the following for sale and would consider a combined price (I would actually prefer to sell as a job lot)  -
- Klingon Attack £23.00 (also listed separately)
- Romulan Space £30.00
- Border Box #1 (contains 24 metal mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s) = £72.00
If you are interested in any of the above drop me a gm and I will adjust the price accordingly.
* Not sure if I have all of the original boxes - I consolidated everything into a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Really Useful_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; box. I will check for the boxes, if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important.</notes>
