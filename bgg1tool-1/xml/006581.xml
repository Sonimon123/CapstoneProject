   <description>Korea: The Forgotten War, Is the ninth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) release by The Gamers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Korean War stands as a key event in world history. The first shooting confrontation of the Cold War, and the first limited war of the nuclear age, it is the only time since the Second World War that two of the world's major military powers fought one another - in this case the United States and China._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Diplomatically, the war offers an interesting view of the miscalculation and ineptitude on both sides that led to open conflict. It also brings to light the United Nations' first opportunity to play a leading role in world military events._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Korea: The Forgotten War covers the first year of the war and highlights the mobile phases of the battle. Campaign victory is determined most often by the stable positions of the lines (relative to the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;neck_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of the peninsula). A number of shorter scenarios are also included to allow players to explore specific operations or to use as a training scenario before taking on one of the campaign games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Korea: The Forgotten War was initially released in 2003. The 2014 (2nd edition) is a reprint of the 2003 (1st edition) with changes made to address errata and to better conform to the latest version of the OCS rules when printed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Korea: The Forgotten War has 15 scenarios broken down as follows:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    5 1-map scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 2-map scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    6 3-map scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Turn: Half-week_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units: Battalion to Army_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2014 Game Inventory:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Three 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 2 markers - 560 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 48-page OCS v4.1a rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 40-page Korea v2.0 game specific rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 4-page OCS v4.1a Charts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Tables Folders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two dual-sided Player Aid cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity: High_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Solitaire Suitability: High_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: 4-100 hours_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players: 1 or more_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>CONDITION NOTES : Shrink removed to verify contents. Unpunched. Stored at room temperature in a smoke _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; pet free environment.
REASON FOR SELLING : Primarily lack of time to play, however I also have property taxes coming up soon and I need to narrow down my gaming collection. I spent a lot of time hunting this one down so it pains me to let it go, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather know it went to a home where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get played rather than sitting on my shelf collecting dust. Price is to recover what I paid for it, however I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll kick in free UPS Ground (Insured/Tracked/Siganture Required).
PAYMENT : Verified PayPal (payment and shipping address) only. My PayPal account is a premier account and can accept CC transactions and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll eat the extra $3 charge if you pay with a CC.
SHIPPING : I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship once PayPal clears the funds and confirms your shipping address is verified. This is very important as I WILL NOT ship to an unverified address. This is for your protection and mine. Finally, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only ship to a U.S. address in the 48 continental States. No P.O. Boxes as UPS does not deliver to those.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be leaving the country on October 28th and not returning until Mid-November, 2008. Please understand the game won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship until I return if you buy it right before I leave or while I am out of the country.
REFERENCES : My paypal account is verified, and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like you can check me out on ebay. My user account is jyeackle which I opened back in 2000 and I have a 100% feedback.
Thanks!

    <notes>This is a mint copy of Korea: The Forgotten War (OCS Series). The shrinkwrap has been removed but all components are unused. The counters are all unpunched. Charts and Rulebooks are all unread. Maps are unused and have only been unfolded once to check their condition. All components are in perfect condition.
I pack very responsibly and make every effort to ensure the item arrives in the same state it is posted. I have sold several games here and on e-Bay and have always received positive feedback.
Please contact me by geek mail if you would like photos of the game box and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s components.</notes>

    <notes>The game is in immaculate condition as is the box itself. Only the shrinkwrap has been removed.
Payment in the UK by personal cheque or PayPal.
Payment from Europe by Bank Transfer or PayPal..
Payment from North America and Australasia by PayPal only.
For payment by PayPal I will add 2% to the invoice.
The game will be very securely packed so as to ensure it reaches you in the same condition it leaves me.
I will only send recorded delivery (signed for), and I also recommend insurance be paid by the buyer, as the generic insurance level is limited to £39.

Shipping in the UK is GBP recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.</notes>
