   <description>This classic game of pure negotiation has taken many forms over the years._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first The Avalon Hill Game Co version has perhaps the widest release, but Avalon Hill Games, Inc. re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces.  In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, players represent one of the seven _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Great Powers of Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;orders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Colonial Diplomacy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Diplomacy: Classical Variant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the 1992 fancy Deluxe Edition of the game.  The map is clean and easier to read, and the pieces are handsome blocks of wood, which look far better than the recycled Monopoly pieces that the current edition uses.  This game has been opened, but it is mint, and has never been played.  Shipping is calculated based on where you live. I can send it via Priority Mail if you live in the US. Feel free to ask questions!</notes>

    <notes>Wooden pieces.  This is a classic and treasured game!  The board and pieces are in good shape.  The box has corner wear, and one of the corners is split.  My gaming group is not sufficiently cut-throat to appreciate this game, so I’m culling it from my collection.  I will charge $15 for shipping to the continental U.S..  I’m willing to ship it outside the continental U.S., but will charge my cost plus $2. I have pictures if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to see them.  Just let me know and we can arrange for their delivery.

    <notes>This is the Hasbro/Avalon Hill strategy board game, Diplomacy - The Game of International Intrigue.
The actual game is in wonderful condition, and has only been played a few times.  Every piece seems to be there.  If anything is missing, it is only a token or two.  The board has some very slight wear in a few of the corners, but nothing that will hinder game play.  The box has a little bit of wear and tear, as well as some fading, but the box is still sturdy.  The instruction manual is included, but does have a few stains from paint and ink on the front cover.  The original Conference Maps are included, though some are missing from previous use.
This game is rare and hard to find.  Bid now before someone else gets this wonderful game.

    <notes>Wooden pieces.  This is a classic and treasured game!  The board and pieces are in good shape.  The box has corner wear, and one of the corners is split.  My gaming group is not sufficiently cut-throat to appreciate this game, so I’m culling it from my collection.  I will charge $15 for shipping to the continental U.S..  I’m willing to ship it outside the continental U.S., but will charge my cost plus $2.

Just some minor shelf wear. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be charging 15.00 for shipping as this is pretty heavy compared to most games. Thanks-</notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill (AVH 22193 / WOC 221930000)
A Game of International Intrigue, Trust, and Treachery.
Keep Your Enemies Close
At the turn of the 20th century, prior to World War I, the seven Great European Powers engage in an intricate struggle for supremacy. 
Military forces invade and withdraw, shifting borders and altering empires with subtle maneuvers and daring gambits.
Alliances are formed and trust is betrayed as players negotiate and outwit one another-in a delicate balance of cooperation and competition-to gain dominance of the continent. 
Diplomacy® challenges players to rely on their own cunning and cleverness, not dice, to determine the outcome of this game of conspiracies and conquest.

    <notes>Received this copy in a Maths Trade, opened it and instantly realised this was not for my game group. Putting it up for sale here in the hope it will find a home that will appreciate it more. Very reasonable price. The previous owners obviously loved this game, and there are numerous player aids included. Beautiful AH edition with metal guns and ships.
I will determine exact freight then get back to you, so you wont pay a dollar more than needed. If you are in a hurry I can just accept $15 postage for anywhere in Australia.</notes>

U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 5 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill (WOC 221930000)
A Game of International Intrigue, Trust, and Treachery.
Keep Your Enemies Close
At the turn of the 20th century, prior to World War I, the seven Great European Powers engage in an intricate struggle for supremacy. Military forces invade and withdraw, shifting borders and altering empires with subtle maneuvers and daring gambits.  Alliances are formed and trust is betrayed as players negotiate and outwit one another-in a delicate balance of cooperation and competition-to gain dominance of the continent. Diplomacy challenges players to rely on their own cunning and cleverness, not dice, to determine the outcome of this game of conspiracies and conquest.</notes>

    <notes>1982 Avalon Hill version (box states copywrite as 1976, but instructions list it as the 1982 2nd edition) with plastic pieces (shaped as stars and anchors).  Purple cover.  Game is unplayed - plastic pieces are still sealed in the factory bag.  Game box has been opened, but is complete and in very good condition (expect that the box and components have a musty smell).  Box has slight wear as expected with age.
Shipping will be via Priority Mail - estimated 2-3 days across the US.  Quick and safe shipping once payment is made.</notes>

However, it is missing one fleet counter (Red, I think). It would be easy to make a substitute, and also it would only come into play when that color gets all their fleets onto the board.
Non-smoking home, English. Buyer to pay shipping, $8 at most in the U.S., could be less depending on how close to Washington State you live.</notes>

Components are sorted and bagged, and the game comes with Diplomacy Gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide published by Avalon Hill.
The game has barely been played.

    <notes>Avalon Hill (Hasbro) 1999 Edition (mint) DIPLOMACY
This classic game of pure negotiation has taken many forms over the years. The first version has perhaps the widest release, but avalon-hill-hasbro re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces. They recently released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies. In the game, players represent one of the seven _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Great Powers of Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. 
There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: They can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;orders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many a gamer.
This game is opened and sorted but was never played.

    <notes>This is the 1976 Avalon Hill edition of the game. It is in good shape, except for two issues. One, one box corner (lower right) is split. Two, the game is missing the conference map you use for negotiation (this is not the same as the actual game board). However, such maps are readily available here on the Geek, such as this one: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/8219/diplomacy-map-pdf.</notes>

    <notes>1999 Hasbro Release with awesome metal pieces and nice map.  I take very good care of my games, unfortunately in this case my movers did not and the box is intact but damaged, bent, etc.  Everything inside is perfect and intact.  Never actually been played.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 90oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>2008 Avalon Hill edition.  Game has been opened but never punched or played.  The rules have been read but _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;unused!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; since we never played.  We could never get our group to take the plunge.  This one is basically brand new with some slight shelf wear to the box.
Shipping will be my cost: $11.35 (for priority).  Once USPS get parcel post back I can use that option - for now I believe it has been suspended.  I will gladly combine shipping and send you an invoice if you purchase multiple games</notes>

    <notes>WIZARDS OF THE COAST (WOC221930000)
Diplomacy: Keep Your Enemies Close! At the turn of the 20th century, prior to World War I, the seven Great European Powers engage in an intricate struggle for supremacy. Military forces invade and withdraw, shifting borders and altering empires with subtle maneuvers and daring gambits. Alliances are formed and trust is betrayed as players negotiate and outwit one another - in a delicate balance of cooperation and competition - to gain dominance of the continent. Diplomacy challenges players to rely on their own cunning and cleverness, not dice, to determine the outcome of this game of conspiracies and conquest. </notes>

Game is in Sydney. Shipping outside Australia may be expensive, so will you pay the lesser of the actual shipping cost and what it would have cost to send you the game from the US west coast. I will make up any difference.</notes>

    <notes>Wizards of the Coasts (WOC221930000)
Diplomacy: Keep Your Enemies Close! At the turn of the 20th century, prior to World War I, the seven Great European Powers engage in an intricate struggle for supremacy. Military forces invade and withdraw, shifting borders and altering empires with subtle maneuvers and daring gambits. Alliances are formed and trust is betrayed as players negotiate and outwit one another - in a delicate balance of cooperation and competition - to gain dominance of the continent. Diplomacy challenges players to rely on their own cunning and cleverness, not dice, to determine the outcome of this game of conspiracies and conquest.</notes>

    <notes>100% complete-- I counted all metal pieces and tokens to confirm completeness. All game components are in excellent condition, and many of the flag tokens are still unpunched. There are about 18 unused pages left on the pad of map sheets. The box is just in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition with no split corners, but it does have a dented corner and some indentations-- see final two photos for detailed looks at these flaws</notes>

    <notes>This is straight from a time machine!  It is still in its original zip wrap, and never been opened!  The only damage is slight  tear in the zip wrap on the back.  Box is like new without any blemish.  I doubt there is another copy this pristine and untouched after 41years!  A collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item par excellence.  This early version of the game had the original four color map, wooden playing pieces, and added black and white conference maps.  The rules are probably dated 1974.  I have not opened the game and so cannot confirm the rules date.</notes>
