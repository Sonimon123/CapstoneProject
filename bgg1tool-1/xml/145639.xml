   <description>Coconuts is a dexterity game based on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Monkey King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; character from Chinese mythology._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, players launch coconuts toward a field of cups in the middle of the playing area. Land in a cup, and you get to stack it on your player board; land in a cup on someone else's board, and you get to move it to yours. By playing special _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Monkey King Magic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards, you can force opponents to shoot blind, take long shots, or otherwise bollix their efforts to cup a coconut. Whoever first completes a pyramid of six cups on his player board wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>
