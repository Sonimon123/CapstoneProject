   <description>The game board in Heimlich _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Co. is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven differently colored _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;spies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; are placed on the board. On a player's turn, he rolls a dice, then moves any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Heimlich _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity. (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Heimlich_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, by the way, is a German adjective meaning secretly and slyly, so Heimlich _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Co. translates as Clandestine and Company!)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I am selling a copy of the original Perlhuhn edition, which is a collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item.  The price is a bit speculative (although it has gone for about this much on ebay.de), I am willing to consider offers.
The game is from Sid Sackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s collection (though it does not have the stamp), and appears to be unplayed.</notes>

Winner of the Spiel des Jahres for 1986.
Contents and box are clean, undamaged, and complete.
Our family liked the game so much, this was our 2nd box.  This is the German version, 1986 Ravensburger, and I copied the rules from our 1st edition and included them with this box.  There are no words used on the board, cards, or anywhere--this game uses graphics only.</notes>

    <notes>Box is well scuffed, but the game is fine. This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Heimlich _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Co._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; edition, in English. It has no _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Top Secret_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards, and the die is a standard d6. The die is easy enough to work around if you prefer the newer rules: a player who rolls a 1 can treat it as a 1, 2, or 3 (or 0 in the new variant). Both rulebooks are published on the Geek. The rules I have are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Under Cover.pdf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, Rio Grande_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;TopSecretSpies(Heimlich_US).pdf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;</notes>

    <notes>a few _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;problems_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but a very playable game... the box is a bit scuffed and one corner is split, the wood components are in excellent condition, the board is slightly warped but otherwise looks great, the rules are missing but replaced with a photocopy, the seven agent cards are missing but I have printed up a (color) set and placed them in sleeves... so the game is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;complete_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, just with some home-made replacement parts
this game is just a bit too long for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;flat rate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box, which means it will probably go for ship priority (within the USA) for a little less than the standard priority flat rate</notes>

Meets the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good condition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; criteria due to scuffing and light corner damage on box (Top layer of paper rubbed off over time apparently in corners.), However, the box is fully intact with no crushing or splits. Also, there is a bit of red wax crayon on the bottom from the pricing monkeys at the flea market where I bought it.
Oddly, the pieces inside were still sealed in their original baggies when I bought it, and its only been played by myself. I will even toss in the meager amount of card sleeves I used for the game.
The game itself has been played a grand total two times in its lifetime.
Willing to ship anywhere in the United States, except no PO boxes or APO/FPO addresses.
Buyer pays shipping and actual shipping cost.

    <notes>The game is complete and in very good condition.  It has been played a few times, so the rules and box aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mint, but are still very good shape.  The beefy bits and the game board are rock solid and in excellent shape.  The game is odor free.</notes>
