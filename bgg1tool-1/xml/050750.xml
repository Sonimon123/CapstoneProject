   <description>Welcome to the Tasty Minstrel universe! Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry. An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold. Build buildings in the five districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Belfort is a worker placement game with area majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind! Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The game has only been played once. A few of the cardboard pieces have some small rips from when I punched them out (the quality of these pieces was disappointingly cheap-feeling, although the rest of the components are in great shape).
I would estimate shipping costs to be somewhere in between $10-14, depending on where you live.</notes>

    <notes>Unopened, still sealed. Tasty Minstrel Games English language version.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $6.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games (TTT1006)
Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city. Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry. An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold. Build buildings in the 5 districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities. Belfort is a Worker Placement game with Area Majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind. Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort. </notes>

    <notes>Original seal, never opened.  Comes with Promo Guild Pack.
Medium flat-rate box shipping possible($11.35), but fit would be tight, so I would assume no responsibility for damage incurred during shipment if this option is chosen.  Otherwise I will ship in larger box, which will probably cost a few dollars more (~$15?).
Please contact with questions prior to purchase.  Thank you.</notes>

This can fit in a Regional Rate B box and ship priority for the same amount as a 4 pound priority commercial base rate package from 55404, which is fairly cheap if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re near Minneapolis. It can also go Priority Flat Rate Commercial Base ($11.30). 
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I take USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept standard Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments, but your grand total will suffice to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after Paypal takes their fees out, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the transferred amount. A little less than $2 for this one, probably.
I also am happy to take ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments for the exact sale price plus exact postage.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, then choose the option of send money to friends and family, NOT to purchase goods. Make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees.)</notes>

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games (TTT1006)
Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city. Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry. An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold. Build buildings in the 5 districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities. Belfort is a Worker Placement game with Area Majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind. Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort. </notes>

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games (TTT1006)
Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city. Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry. An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold. Build buildings in the 5 districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities. Belfort is a Worker Placement game with Area Majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind. Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort. </notes>

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games (TTT1006)
Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city. Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry. An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold. Build buildings in the 5 districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities. Belfort is a Worker Placement game with Area Majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind. Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort.</notes>

I will ship from Germany and I am willing to ship anywhere.
Please ask me, for the shipping costs for your land.
I will charge shipping at cost. Everything will be well packed.
You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.
If you buy more games, then I make all in one package!
We have a large private collection of games. Due to space and time constraints we must rid ourselves of some of the games. Therefore, these are private sales.</notes>

    <notes>Selling Belfort (base game) + the Expansion Expansion all in the same box.
Shipping is from the DC metro area. Also available for local pickup.
This game is like new and played a few times. All components are stickered and accounted for. This game is currently out of print from what I understand.
Payment for the game is expected via Paypal within a week of the invoice being sent.
Shipping costs are done according to what is cheapest for the buyer. Typically, this will be via USPS Priority Mail flat rate box which includes a tracking #. The shipping weight of this item is ~5 lbs.</notes>
