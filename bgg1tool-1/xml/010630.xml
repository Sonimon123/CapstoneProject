   <description>Memoir '44  is a historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Memoir '44 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;By design, the game is not overly complex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Being not much of a wargame buff, I got this to play with my Dad when he visited.  We did play... but just once.  My wife says I must sell it to pay for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the Boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, which is the game I really want.  This game is in mint condition and was taken out of shrink wrap, played once and is just gathering dust in the closet.  So it needs a loving home, and I am sure with the expansions due out, it will find one.  Personal checks MUST clear BEFORE shipment takes place.    Note: Shipping and handling costs are $8.50 and unfortunately I do not do anything with PayPal.   I apologize for the inconvienence for those people who use that as a primary form of payment.  To be fair, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in a big hurry and a check or money order is not convienent, you might want to check other options.</notes>

Opened, but never played. This is the English edition, but made in Germany.  Although I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve not seen the newest reprint of this game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve heard the dice and bit quality has dropped. This is the version which contains the white etched dice and thick tiles. Mint condition, never played, and cards are sleeved.
Shipping Costs: $8.95 via USPS Priority Mail
International Shipping Varies on Location
Combined shipping free on purchase costs of more than $100.00

    <notes>The components are in very nice shape, cards well tended and figures are all fine.  The box has a little shelfwear, but is solid and basically good as new.  The flimsy plastic insert, however, is cracked/split (it was that way when I bought it).  It still functions fine, but some people don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like those sorts of things.
The actual weight might vary slightly after packing; I just give an honest guess, in this case 4 pounds.  I ship via USPS from zip 80015.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing or handling, and will use the lower of Flat Rate ($9.30 now, but it creeps up now and then) or Priority Mail, or Parcel Post if you prefer.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

This is my favorite board game ever, and it KILLS me to part with it.

I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If you order several games from me, I will combine shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This package includes ALL of the following:
 - Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 base game
 - Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44: Eastern Front
 - Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44: Pacific Theater
 - Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44: Air Pack
 - Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44: Terrain Pack
 - Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44: Winter/Desert Board
I store the game completely in the box of the base game (with baggies and GMT trays), and have thrown away the box insert and most of the expansion boxes (HOWEVER, I still have the Air Pack box). I have also thrown away superfluous rulebooks like Eastern Front, Pacific Theater etc, and have only the rulebooks for the base game and Air Pack (since Air Pack consolidates all the previous expansions).
Everything is in excellent condition! Only flaw is one of the Allied infantry and artillery in the base set come off their base, but it came this way when I opened the shrink, and you can just hold them together.</notes>

As a bonus, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bunch of laminated play aids, including several that go with the expansions to this, the base game.</notes>

(2X) Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44: Breakthrough (2010)
+ Extra Command Card deck.
COMPLETE SET with ALL EXPANSIONS! Includes an extra copy of the base game, an extra Breakthrough, and a set of Overlord cards.
Everything is in NM/MINT condition - some even shrinkwrapped. This is a fantastic setup. I just moved and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t got the room to keep all my games. :(
Everything is boxed up with extra packing to make sure it arrives in great shape. Shipping is included in the price (a $30-$40 value).
The original boxes are included. All cards are in unused condition (I used a spare set of Overlord cards).
PAYMENT preferred via Amazon Gift Card Email - but, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also take checks. Sorry, no PayPal.
Enjoy!

    <notes>This includes the base game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; all the following expansions :
- Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 (Base Game)
- Terrain Pack
- Eastern Front
- Pacific Theatre
- Air Pack
- Campaign Book 1
- Winter / Desert Map Board
Only the main game, winter board _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; terrain pack have seen play. All other components have been punched, but never played. Everything is in very good - excellent condition.
The artillery in the base game is all there, but has fallen apart (they were pretty flimsy to start with) - I replaced them with Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies artillery miniatures (also included).
Another classic that hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played for a few years so is looking for a home where it will be well cared for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; loved. 
Will ship to Australia only. Game will be packed well _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; shipping will be by parcel post (happy to provide shipping estimate based on destination). Pickup available in Sydney West area (Blacktown).
Happy to answer any questions.

    <notes>This is a custom listing for Fkrueger1.  It includes all items listed below.  Shipping will be $10.  
All the game materials are in very good condition.  All but one of the expansion Most everything fits in the main Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 box (minus the original insert).  I do not have the original plastic or paper boxes for the Pacific or Eastern Front expansion, although I do have it for the Terrain pack.  I do have the external box sleaves for Eastern and Pacific Expansion.
This lot includes:
The Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 base game (game materials are in very good to like new condition, although one artillery and one hedgehogs have had an elements come unattached (a wheel and a support beam).  The elements are in the bags and could be glued back together (this sort of break is pretty common and has happened in my personal base game and that of a friends).  Cards look virtually unplayed.
Eastern Front Expansion--complete and very good to like new condition.
Terrain Expansion--complete and very good to like new condition.
Pacific Expansion--complete and very good to like new condition.  This one is becoming a bit more difficult to find right now (12/31/11)

    <notes>Game is in fantastic shape, all pieces are organized in a Plano box.  I got this the same time a friend got Battle Lore.  Battle Lore is now his favorite game, so Memoir likely won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be hitting the table again.
I bought the game ding _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; dent, the corner of the box has a split.  I (very carefully) used clear tape on the inside to hold the corner together.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a clean split, and it is barely noticeable when looking at the outside of the box.  Game is well cared for from a smoke free home.
Shipping is from 04011, parcel post is usually the cheapest and would likely be around $11 to many places.
Let me know if you have any questions or would like photos of the game before buying.  Thanks.</notes>

Payment:
Within Euro-zone the EU-standard-bank-transfer (SEPA, IBAN/BIC) is recommended, it´s quick, save and causes no fees. Paypal is certainly also possible, fees within EU are 0,35 Euro + 1,9% of the total.

I have dispensed with some of the plastic box inserts - they really don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t help with storage once you are using the games, and a number of cards and counters have been collated for ease of storage.
All the boxes themselves are present.
** The desert board as a couple of very small indents in it, I doubt you will notice when in use, but for the sake of full disclosure.
Obviously quite heavy if you buy everything - will ship using MyHermes within the UK.
From a smoke and pet free home - I am very careful when I pack things for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>There is some slight fading or wear around the edges of some of the command cards.  Also, the game is missing one (1) of the green barbed wire plastic pieces and one (1) of the blue tank obstacles is broken (received that way when purchased brand new in 2004).  I have tried to display that in the pictures.  The green barbed wire will not affect gameplay as you can substitute a blue one for scenarios requiring all six (6) allied barbed wire obstacles.</notes>

Hi,
thank you for buying my game.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d prefer to do the handover on Thursday 12:00 at the GeneralMath Trade meeting. 
Hope this will be OK for you. Please let me know if not.
Most likely I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have a fixed post there with an orange piece of paper pinned to the wall and the name of my avatar written on it.
However, juust in case my mobile no is +49 (0)176 56806418. Could you please give me yours as well.
And please try to bring the exact amount of money to pay your game. Thank you.
Cheers,
Carsten</notes>

    <notes># Information
This is a bundle compiled of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; including the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Terrain pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (see https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/19244/memoir-44-terrain-pack) and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tigers in the snow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (see https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/41571/memoir-44-tigers-snow), i.e. the base game and the extensions for the given price.
However the base game and all two extensions are in the box of the base game. This means the box of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Terrain Pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, the bag of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tigers in the snow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the inlay of the base game will not be shipped.
# Condition
I played this game several times but I did not play it in the last couple of years. It is just not my game and I lack the players and time to play it more often. I want to remove it from my collection and find a new home for the game. The box of the base game and all components are in a very good condition. The play cards have some minor tears on the side (since I used them) however the cards are in a good condition. The manual has a wrinkle on the back side as if it was folded (which may have happened). It is visible but not very prominent. Please do also read the information in the information section.
# Shipping
I will ship worldwide with DHL. Costs dependent on your location:
Germany:    4.50 €
EU:         9.00 €
Non-EU:    16.00 €
Additional packaging costs: 2.00 €
# Shipping time
I am full-time employed and can only send the package on weekends. If you are really impatient (and I do understand) then please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t order here, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to make you unhappy.
# Payment
Ideally via bank transfer with IBAN within EU states or paypal.</notes>

    <notes>The game has been played only a very few times and is in a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (almost like new) condition. 
The content is complete and in very good condition (no broken pieces and only minimal wear on the cards). The box looks like new without shelf wear.
Within Euro-Zone I do prefer payment via SEPA bank transfer (as it is safe and fast).
If you want to pay via PAYPAL this will normally be OK, too, but please contact me upfront and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to take over all PAYPAL fees.
Shipping costs (without insurance/tracking):
Germany: € 7,-
EU: € 17,-
Rest of the world: please ask</notes>

    <notes>This is a huge Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 lot - a very nearly complete collection!
Most of it is Out of Print and easily sells for $100+ for a single pack or battle map. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m heavily discounting it (given the size of the lot and amount of OOP stuff, the price is actually way lower than I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d probably get selling stuff individually), partly due to the fact that some of the packaging on a few of the packs were pretty smashed up during original shipping and some of the boxes have some wear on the outside (this mix of conditions is why I listed this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;). Almost all this material, however, is in unplayed condition. The Air pack, for example, comes in its original box and has a dented corner but otherwise is in great shape.

    <notes>Large collection of Memoir 44  game and expansion components.  It is listed as very good because this only includes the base game box; all other components are included in plastic containers and bagged, labeled components.  The set includes the base game plus expansions: Air Pack, Breakthrough, Eastern Front, Hedgerow Hell, Mediterranean Theater, Operation Overlord, Overlord, Pacific Theater, Terrain Pack, Tigers in the Snow, Winter Wars, Sword of Stalingrad, Winter/Desert Board Map, Campaign Books Vol 1 and 2 and Tactics and Strategy Guide book.  The base game was played lightly but is in excellent, almost like new.  The other components are bagged and in like new condition from a smoke free home.  Just never ended up playing this as much as I planned.  Great collection at an excellent composite price for this collection; many are out of print.  
Buyer pays shipping (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship either USPS priority mail, FedEx Ground or, if less expensive, UPS Ground); expect this will be rather expensive depending on buyer location; this ships from NJ.  Also, buyer to pay pay pal fee.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling off my Memoir _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 collection since it gets no playing time. In this lot is:
[gameid=10630]
[gameid=31638]
[gameid=19245]
[gameid=21384]
[gameid=19244]
[gameid=19374]
Also included is a M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 Recon Team commemorative pin which I got from participating in the beta for the PC online game.
 
All are in their original boxes. They come from a smoke-free home.
CONDITION: During a recent move, the movers managed to damage some of my game boxes, with this being one of them. The base game has a corner split, one other barely starting, and shows general shelf wear. The Air Pack had something heavy put on one corner by the movers which dished it and started splitting the corner. I have attached pictures to give an idea of the condition.
SHIPPING: I will ship to the United States. I generally use USPS Priority Mail, but will look for a cheaper option if it exists. Buyer will pay the actual shipping costs. I will cover the packaging costs. I will get insurance if requested.
PAYMENT: I prefer PayPal, but will entertain other options if needed. Just ask.</notes>
