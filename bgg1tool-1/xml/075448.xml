   <description>Tanto Cuore: Romantic Vacation, the second expansion for the deck-building game Tanto Cuore in addition to being a standalone game, is themed around a paradise island vacation. (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Dokidoki_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, the sound of heartbeat in Japanese, means _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;exciting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;romantic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, which is why the English name is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Romantic Vacation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;.) Players take the role of house lords and start with a deck containing some love cards and a few maids. During the game, players gradually employ more maids, increasing their deck of cards, and the player who collects the most victory points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Romantic Vacation includes love cards and maid cards like the parent game, but no event cards (curse cards) nor private maids (unique cards with a lasting effect). Instead the game introduces reminiscence cards, representing memorial events, like _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Camp Fire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Watching the stars_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Picnic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, etc. These cards are worth substantial victory points, but unlike the other victory points they are not bought with love, but gained by discarding a specified number of maid cards from your hand, thus introducing the possibility of getting victory points from pure maid cards, previously not possible. These reminiscence cards never enter a player's deck._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>
