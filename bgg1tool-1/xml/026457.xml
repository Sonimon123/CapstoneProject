   <description>When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms. Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Successors was first published in 1995 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved.

    <notes>This 3rd Edition Successors wargame by GMT Games has been played only once as I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the theme. This truly stunningly produced game is 100% complete, but the counters are unpunched and played once. Otherwise the game is in pristine condition, therefore the like new rating. It comes from a non smoking home and has been very well kept. More images of the game are available on request.

I did take 2 of the plastic general stands and spray paint them black, so that each player could have the stands match his player color.

    <notes>Game has been played 3 or 4 times and is in great shape inside and out.  Rules look a bit read and have a small tear along the spine.  A couple of the general stands were colored black with a Sharpie to match the black player since GMT screwed up the stands that came with the game.  The Sharpie should come off with rubbing alcohol if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a problem for you.  Everything else is in excellent condition.  
Domestic shipping is $12.35 via USPS Priority Mail.  Contact me for an international shipping quote.

    <notes>Counters un-punched, cards in shrink-wrap!  
For the box perfectionists amongst us: there is a small blemish on the front top left corner of the box and some minor whitening of the other 3 corners.  Otherwise, this puppy is brand new!
Shipping: the price I pay to Canada Post, FedEx, or UPS (your choice of company and method) is the price you pay. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge extra for handling or packing materials. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere in the world (yes, that includes Brazil)... but all buyers should be aware that I assume no liability for parcels when they leave my hands. Insurance recommended, particularly for international buyers.
Payment: I am an L5R addict, and I typically buy my booster boxes through CoolStuffInc, so I would prefer a CSI Gift Certificate, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d also accept payment by Amazon GC. If the buyer would prefer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also take Paypal, provided the buyer covers any fee that may apply.
Miscellaneous: BGG will receive its 3%, of course. Item will ship within 3 days of payment clearing. Any questions, please feel free to PM!</notes>

    <notes>Condition: Complete game (no missing pieces). All components in good condition. Rules most likely will have handwritten clarifications on them.
Game price and Shipping cost depends on the 3 regions.
If you are in Canada, game price is in Canadian $ and shipping is 20 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, game price is in US $ and shipping is 30 US$.
If you are in EU, game price is in Euros and shipping is 80 Euros.
Shipping is the same for multiple items.
Payment: PayPal only.
My Paypal username is :
pnomikos@cogeco.ca
If you are in Canada, you pay in CDN$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in the USA, you pay in US$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in EU, you pay in Euros (game price and shipping).
Example:
The price of the game is 10$.
If you are in Canada, your total cost is 10+20=30 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, your total cost is 10+30=40 US$.
If you are in EU, your total cost is 10+80=90 Euros.</notes>
