    <notes>Queen Games - Aqua Romana
Language: Dutch - English - French - Italian - German - Spanish
2 to 4 players
8 year and older
Duration: 45 to 60 min
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,485 kg
Theme: The young, up-and-coming Roman kingdom needs a wide variety of things, but the one thing the big towns need above all others is drinking water. So experienced master builders and diligent workmen set about errecting mighty aquaducts to provide the people with water. Use your skill to make sure that your workmen have access to the necessary master builders at all times and are able to build the longest water system. However, all your achievements will receive less attention if the other players manage to transport the same amount of water to the town.

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>All products are as described. If you have questions, please let me know.
Please take a look at all the games I have for sale. If you purchase multiple games, I am willing to ship them out together to save on shipping costs.
For international orders, I will only ship via Priority International Mail via US Postal Service. While more expensive, it allows for quicker, more reliable delivery and also includes insurance. Other shipping methods are cheaper, but unreliable in many parts of the world, after it leaves the US Postal Service.
Thanks for your consideration.
