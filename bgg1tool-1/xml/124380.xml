   <description>The unusual and asymmetric game Ladies _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Gentlemen brings players into the world of glamour. In teams of two _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; one playing a man, the other a woman _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the players try to pull together the best-looking and most famous couple who will attend the big ball. The gentleman's duty is to make as much money as possible, which the lady will then spend on jewelry, clothes, and exclusive accessories. Each team has its own action cards to carry out its tasks, and the more that the players embody their characters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; flirtatious, fashion-obsessed ladies, and rich, arrogant, pretentious gentlemen _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the more fun and explosive the game will be!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>
