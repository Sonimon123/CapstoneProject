Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city.

    <notes>What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Your Game? (WYG0002)
Oddly enough, several of you have been hired to build the city of OddVille, home to four powerful worker guilds. Cleverly place your buildings in order to obtain greater power and fame, while thwarting your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; plans. Manage your workers to obtain the resources, coins, and building projects you need in order to make your mark on the city. Plan the city streets to get access to resources or coins from nearby buildings, even if not yours. Impress the right guild, and you will get a visit from a guild member, who will gladly help you out while enjoying your hospitality. The guild comes first, though: At a moment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s notice, every guild member will return to the guild hall, regardless of how much that inconveniences you. Of course, the person who _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;inspired_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; the guild meeting may be chuckling gleefully at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;unfortunate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; timing of your guest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s departure. OddVille is a card-based city-building game in which all actions are carried out by playing one of your four Worker cards. Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city. Connect it to adjacent buildings with roads and you will gain their bonus. The city grows with each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s contribution, ever changing the values of players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; buildings. As soon as a player builds his sixth building, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. </notes>

    <notes>What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Your Game? (WYG0002)
Oddly enough, several of you have been hired to build the city of OddVille, home to four powerful worker guilds. Cleverly place your buildings in order to obtain greater power and fame, while thwarting your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; plans. Manage your workers to obtain the resources, coins, and building projects you need in order to make your mark on the city. Plan the city streets to get access to resources or coins from nearby buildings, even if not yours. Impress the right guild, and you will get a visit from a guild member, who will gladly help you out while enjoying your hospitality. The guild comes first, though: At a moment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s notice, every guild member will return to the guild hall, regardless of how much that inconveniences you. Of course, the person who _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;inspired_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; the guild meeting may be chuckling gleefully at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;unfortunate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; timing of your guest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s departure. OddVille is a card-based city-building game in which all actions are carried out by playing one of your four Worker cards. Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city. Connect it to adjacent buildings with roads and you will gain their bonus. The city grows with each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s contribution, ever changing the values of players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; buildings.

Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city. Connect it to adjacent buildings with roads and you will gain their bonus. The city grows with each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s contribution, ever changing the values of players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; buildings. As soon as a player builds his sixth building, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.</notes>

    <notes>What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Your Game? (WYG0002)
Oddly enough, several of you have been hired to build the city of OddVille, home to four powerful worker guilds. Cleverly place your buildings in order to obtain greater power and fame, while thwarting your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; plans. Manage your workers to obtain the resources, coins, and building projects you need in order to make your mark on the city. Plan the city streets to get access to resources or coins from nearby buildings, even if not yours. Impress the right guild, and you will get a visit from a guild member, who will gladly help you out while enjoying your hospitality. The guild comes first, though: At a moment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s notice, every guild member will return to the guild hall, regardless of how much that inconveniences you. Of course, the person who _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;inspired_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; the guild meeting may be chuckling gleefully at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;unfortunate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; timing of your guest_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s departure. OddVille is a card-based city-building game in which all actions are carried out by playing one of your four Worker cards. Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city. Connect it to adjacent buildings with roads and you will gain their bonus.

    <notes>Box and components are in very good condition for a game so loved and often played! This little feller has become part of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;collect less, play more_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; philosophy that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s now the law in my game room. Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the simple way I decided which of my old friends to keep and which to pass along to a new happy home. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been bringing a few extra _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;surprise_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games to my weekly pre-planned game night (for the last six months or so) to see if anyone would be interested in trying them. The ones that changed our plans and got played still live on my game shelves, the ones that didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t are now yours to play and love. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s becoming ever more difficult lately to negotiate the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;menu_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for my current group_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weekly get-together, and since we evolved as a group by mutual agreement on the type of games we enjoy playing (for the most part!), I want to avoid creating any irreconcilable differences that would lead to a break-up! $13.50 for shipping in USPS flat rate box. Thanks, take care,,,</notes>

    <notes>A city-building game powered by players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; worker cards. Apart from adding buildings to the city, players try to inter-connect them with roads for bonus points. The twist is the opportunity to disrupt players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; plans by summoning guild members back to HQ.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £15.00 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.
I charge shipping at cost, as follows.
  UK addresses: £2.79 (myHermes, takes 2-3 working days, tracked) 
  Other EU countries: £6.96 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Europe outside the EU: £5.80 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)

    <notes>Played one time, excellent condition.
PayPal friends and family option preferred for payment to avoid PayPal fees.
I ship quickly after payment is made, usually next day. I use USPS priority mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is less expensive. I round up to the full dollar amount. International shipping from the US is very expensive so please ask for a quote or do your own research on the approximate cost before you add this to your cart.
Ask if you have any questions. Thanks!</notes>
