   <description>(from MMP website:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;ASL Starter Kit #3 is a self-contained ASL module which will give players the opportunity to start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately. A liberally-illustrated rulebook teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL. If you own and play ASL Starter Kit #2 you will be pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to spot the new rules in ASLSK#3 - we've highlighted the new rules so that you can skip rereading what you've learned in ASLSK#2 and get right to the new rules!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;What does ASLSK#3 add? TANKS! The famous and deadly German _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Tiger_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. The reliable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Sherman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;.

Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#3 adds about 6 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2). A better question would be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Do I need ASLSK#2 if I buy ASLSK#3?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#3. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2 both add more boards and scenarios for you to enjoy. We know it's a little confusing, we hope this clears it up a bit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contents:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        3 8x22 Geomorphic Maps (t, u, and v) for the ASL System_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        1 full Countersheet of 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        1 full Countersheet of 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        1 half Countersheet of 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        8 scenarios printed on 4 individual cardstock sheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        2 quick reference charts printed on cardstock sheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        1 28-page rules booklet (about 17 pages are rules) with plentiful color illustrations_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        1 12-page vehicle and ordnance notes booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        2 dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scenario List:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S20 Joseph 351 Pointe de Corsen, France, 28 August 1944_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S21 Clash at Borisovka Borisovka, Russia, 14 March 1943_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S22 Another Summer's Day Niscemi, Sicily, 10 July 1943_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S23 Monty's Gamble Oosterbeek, Holland, 20 September 1944_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S24 Sherman Marches West Krupki, Byelorussia, 28 June 1944_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S25 Early Battles Kaunas, Lithuania, 26 June 1941_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S26 Last Ally, Last Victory Puspokladany, Hungary, 10 October 1944_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;        S27 Stand For New Zealand Galatas, Crete 25 May 1941_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Time Scale:    2 minutes per Game Turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unit Scale:    5 to 10 men, plus individual leaders, vehicles, guns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Map Scale    40 meters per hex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players:    2 (also suitable for solitaire or team play)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity:    Medium_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Solitaire Suitability:    Medium_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(user's description:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; The final in the three part series of starter kits for Advanced Squad Leader.

    <notes>Multi-Man Publishing (MUM ASLSTARTER3)
ASL Starter Kit #3 is a self-contained ASL module which will give players the opportunity to start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately. A liberally-illustrated rulebook teaches gamers ASL using a conversational style to teach the concepts of ASL. If you own and play ASL Starter Kit #2 you will be pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to spot the new rules in ASLSK#3 - we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve highlighted the new rules so that you can skip rereading what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve learned in ASLSK#2 and get right to the new rules!
What does ASLSK#3 add? TANKS! The famous and deadly German _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tiger_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The reliable _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sherman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The tank which won the east - the T-34.
We know we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get the inevitable question _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do I have to buy ASLSK#1 and/or ASLSK#2 to get ASLSK#3?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#3 adds about 6 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2). A better question would be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do I need ASLSK#2 if I buy ASLSK#3?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#3. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 and ASLSK#2 both add more boards and scenarios for you to enjoy. We know it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little confusing, we hope this clears it up a bit.

    <notes>Partially punched, in ziplocks.
Contents in excellent condition throughout; some handling wear evident on rules, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all.
Box is intact and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;square_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; but both the box lid and bottom have significant dishing due to someone thinking a padded envelope was adequate protection. I can provide photos if anyone is concerned with this.
GET BOTH STARTER KITS #1 AND #3 FOR $60.  BLOODY DO IT NOW!
READ THIS, please.
1) Will ship anywhere at cost.  Insurance/tracking, if available, at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s discretion and expense.
2) I will ALWAYS combine shipping.
3) I am ALWAYS open to offers if you’re considering a multi-game purchase.  Do me the courtesy to extend a genuine offer and I will consider it seriously and provide a courteous response.
4) I can sometimes ship from the USA and save US buyers some $$ on shipping - just Geekmail me and ask when I will next be in MN.  For large purchases I can make a special trip to the border but, please, do not ask me to drive there and deal with the Customs thugs (both ways, mind you!) to save $6 on a $20 purchase.

    <notes>From a smoke-free, pet-free home.
Game condition:
1) contents complete and in excellent condition; counters unpunched.
2) box badly damaged (by a previous owner)--lid ripped and taped back together; box crudely taped shut at some point; sales sticker on cover. Still functions fine as a container but isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t pretty.
Will ship USPS Priority (two-day) Mail. I ask the buyer to cover the BoardGameGeek commission (a bit more than a dollar); I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover the PayPal transaction fee.</notes>

    <notes>The game is verified complete. The two dice are replacements.  The counters have been cleanly clipped by the previous owner.  The clips are uniform, so it looks like a jig was used to clip the counters.  Other than that, the counters are in great like-new shape.  The rulebook shows some wear from being paged through, but no writing or underlining
Includes two (non-matching) counter trays.
Will ship worldwide.</notes>

If You´re a German buyer, just read the text below (“…innerhalb Deutschlands gilt:..”)
Our Terms and Conditions
1. General
All transactions between Gamers HQ and you, the customer, are subject to the following conditions, which you acknowledge by accepting delivery of your ordered products. These conditions do not affect your statutory rights and in all cases German law applies.
2. Orders and prices
We do our level best to ensure that the information on our website is up-to-date. Please note that offers and prices are subject to change. We work to ensure that our prices are all correct, but cannot be held responsible for accidentally displaying the wrong price of a product.
All prices are quoted in Euros and already include all necessary taxes.
3. Lead times and delivery costs
Our products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days. Dispatch and transport are at the expense of the customer. We usually ship orders with DHL but explicitly reserve the right to choose another method of transport. If an order is split into several deliveries, each delivery counts as a separate transaction.
Delivery within Germany is free of charge if your order amounts to a total of 50 euros or more. Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.
Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.
4. Payment options
We currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal. Once you have placed three orders, we also offer you the option to pay by invoice. Such privileges can, however, be withdrawn should we encounter repeated delays in settling invoices.
5. Cancellations, Refunds _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Returns
Should you wish to cancel your order, you can do so by notifying us by fax, email, letter or by simply returning your product(s) to Gamers HQ. No questions asked. Please note that such a cancellation has to be done within two weeks after having received your ordered product(s). Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.
Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine. Any other handling of the product(s) might entitle Gamers HQ to some compensation from you, which might in rare cases amount to the original sum paid for the product(s). So should you feel that you might cancel your order by returning the products, please limit your inspection of the products to optical checks and do not use them on a regular basis.
If you return your order within two weeks in the above manner, we shall refund you the costs for sending the product(s) back to us (unless your cancelled order amounts less than 20 euros, in which case you as the customer will bear the cost of return postage). Please ensure that you use appropriate packing material when sending back the product(s) — preferably using the original wrapping.
Please note that German law, following the EU directive 97/7/EG of 20 May 1997, specifies that the right to return items and receive a full refund is not applicable to the purchase of newspapers, magazines or journals (§312d BGB) as well as the purchase of audio- or video-recordings and software once you have broken the seal of the package.
Should we accidently send you the wrong products, please return them to us and we shall refund you the return postage immediately. Any cancellation of an order has to be done in writing (by post, fax or email).
6. Ownership
Please note that ordered products remain our property until you have fully paid for them.
7. Personal data
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will keep the information you entrust to us safely and securely.
We may collect information from you to monitor website visitor patterns, so that we can improve our website. We also collect information from you to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products and services, update our records and generally maintain your customer profile with us. However, we shall never sell or share your personal information with third parties.
Our customer data — in so far as required to provide the above services and within the limits defined by the data protection laws of Germany (paragraph 26 BDSG) — is saved and handled on a separate, network-independent computer.
8. Other matters
We reserve the right to reject orders without any explanation. Also please note that you as a customer cannot assert a claim against Gamers HQ if, for whatever reason, we are unable to source the item(s) you have ordered. Such cases arise only very exceptionally; we try to ensure that everything we advertise in our web shop is in stock. Where, for whatever reason, we are unable to deliver we promptly refund in full everything you have paid.
9. Limitation of liability: external links
Although we check the content of external links provided on our website, we have no control over or responsibility for these domains to which we provide the links or which link to us. That responsibility solely rests with those who manage the respective domains.
10. Place of jurisdiction
Any disputes arising hereunder will be settled before a Berlin court. We reserve the right to choose the customer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s place of jurisdiction instead.
11. Severability clause
If parts of these terms and conditions become ineffective, the remainder of these terms still apply.
