   <description>Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;U-Go_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s best to the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s worst._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;cool stuff_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply and transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scenario Info:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Turn: 1/2 week_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units: Battalion to Division_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Tables booklets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity: High_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is new, unpunched, complete but not shrink-wrapped anymore. Perfect condition!
I will always send the game with the low-priced company possible or any with any company you wish/possible. Unfortunately prices are quite high for sending things outside Germany or at least outside Europe. Costs within Germany would be 4,- Euros for an insured parcel. Please do ask how much it would to your country!
I accept bank transfer within the European Community and PayPal worldwide.
If there are any questions left: please write me and do ask them!  :-)</notes>

This is a 1st edition Burma.  However, it is in a 2nd edition box.  Picture(s) available on request.
From the BGG Burma page:
Game number 6 in The Gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s popular OCS series (see http://www.gamersarchive.net/theGamers/archive/ for more details on the series and this game), this game covers the campaigns in Burma in 1944, beinging with the Japanese U-Go offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army. While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cool stuff_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply and transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.
Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).
