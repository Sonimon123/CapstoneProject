   <description>Initial publication of the games in the Star Fleet Battles series.  This was one of the first Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was re-implemented and expanded several times after the original _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Pocket Game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is the classic game of tactical Starship combat set in the Star Trek universe (the original TV show), though you will never see _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Star Trek_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; anywhere in the game (licensing limitation).  Players command one or more ships from the Federation, Klingon, Gorn, Romulan, or Kzinti fleets, sporting all of the expected Star Trek weaponry like phasers, disruptor bolts, photon and plasma torpedoes, and tractor beams.  Also includes other weaponry not commonly seen such as drones (homing missiles)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players allocate energy and plot movement before each turn, then move all of the ships simultaneously.  Weapons are fired at will during the turn (i.e., not plotted before-hand like movement).  Ships have shields and armor for protection.  When these are breached, various ship systems are damaged, potentially crippling the combat capability of the ship, and eventually resulting in ship destruction._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game comes with various scenarios for players to reenact battles from the TV series, or provide for solo play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Star Fleet Battles (Designer's Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Star Fleet Battles (Commander's Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition (Current Edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Star Fleet Battle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Captain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition Basic Set, along with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Advanced Missions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set. Lots of counters still unpunched. If you are interested, send me a message and I can get you a complete listing of what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s inside.
Both boxes have been ensconced in clear packing tape, so you may have to live with that...That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what gives it a good condition. Contents look very lightly played and in excellent condition.
Also, as I have no idea of the value, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting it up with a pretty high price. If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s way out of line, feel free to make an offer.</notes>

    <notes>Captain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition--Basic Set.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s identical to the one shown in BGG photo here:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/12448
Never played.  I bought this when I was starting to get into D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D but could never get any of my Uber-hyper friends to sit down and play it with me.  Unpunched, unplayed, intact and from what I can tell, complete.  Very minimal shelf wear for a game that is 26 years old.  Not faded or worn much at all.
Payment must be received prior to shipping.  Shipping will be via FedEx Ground in the U.S.  To a business address, this typically will be $5-6 or less (I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge handling or packaging costs).  International shipments will be by any insurable method and will depend on the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wishes for speed/cost/etc.</notes>

    <notes>Hope I put the game underneath the right title - quite a lot of Star Fleet Battles editions around.. 
Boxed edition - Star Fleet Battles - Volume 1
Box shows just a little bit of wear (top and bottom have a few _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;dents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;). Inside everything there in great condition. Game has never been played, all counters unpunched.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Great Condition
My husband was an avid gamer and collected board games.  His profile is on BBG, under Kimbo.  He took excellent care of all his games and they are all in great condition.  He passed away in 2012, and the time has come for me to start selling games.  Please keep in mind that not all games on his list are for sale, but feel free to ask me about any of them.  Thank you
