    <notes>Mayfair edition.  Not sure if this one has been played or not.  Cards still in the straps.  Pieces and parts all baggied nicely by color and/or shape.  Money still segregated by denomination.  Has been stickered.  Would guess that someone took the time to sticker but did not play.  One box corner is split otherwise it is square and straight.  Some edge wear.  Looks like an unplayed beauty that I can sell cheap.  Worldwide shipping and will be packed well. All forms of negotiable instruments considered.  Combine ship with multiple purchases.</notes>

*PLEASE READ*
I am sending a Marketplace order for each item. If you have won multiple games, you will get multiple orders. You can purchase each one individually or wait to purchase them all at once. This will not change shipping cost. All combined shipping orders will be exact cost. If you won only one item you will pay the listed shipping cost as described in that item.
