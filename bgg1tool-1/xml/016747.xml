   <description>A dexterity dice game consisting of four sets of colored dice one either slides, rolls, or flicks down a stepped surface. Usually one slides the die for better accuracy.  After each person has slid their 4 dice, points are scored.  You score the die roll times a multiplier of either 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times;, 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times;, 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times;, or 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times; depending on which area of the board the die is on.  (Dice which land in the 0_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times; region are immediately removed from play.)  High scoring rolls are targets for opponents.  Four rounds are played and the player with the most points win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tumblin-Dice Jr. is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;travel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; version._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2008 edition from Ferti Games states is for 2-6 players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I am selling a copy of the game Tumblin-Dice that is in mint condition.  I have only played this game with my family once and they didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to appreciate it unfortunately...so instead of watching it sit in my closet, I am hoping someone else can give it a better home.  Included with the game board are all original dice as well as the dry erase marker that is used for scoring.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in or near Cincinnati, Ohio - you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re more than welcome to pick the game up.  I am willing to ship the game, but it might be a little costly due to size/weight of the game.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in having it shipped, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to get the cost from UPS.
Thanks for your interest and please let me know if you have any questions.

Publisher: Fred Distribution [FDD101180]
Number of Players: 2-4

Shipping: Shipping rates will be determined upon sale or request. Insurance is optional but highly recommended for higher priced items. The shipping costs are NOT inflated. You pay exactly what I am charged for shipping, along with material costs. I ship through FedEx or USPS, whichever is cheaper. Normal shipping costs run from $8.00 - $11.00.  If you have a commercial address that I can send to, your shipping costs will be even less!  **NOTE** Tumblin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Dice is a heavy game, and thus shipping costs will be higher than normal. Please request a quote before ordering.
Payment: I accept PayPal, money orders, personal and cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks. Personal checks will be accepted but I will wait until the check has cleared before sending the item. I will add 3.9% to the price when paying by PayPal.

    <notes>Ferti Games version. Components language independent.
Box shows little wear. Inside everything in great condition. Game has hardly been played - if at all.
Shipping will most likely be more expensive (depending on destination) for this one since it is a big/heavy box that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;regular_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; 2 kg box.
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90â‚¬ worldwide and 8.60â‚¬ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>This is the original, big, Nash Games edition. Very heavy, and great construction quality, but the black paint on the bumpers was not varnished and some has chipped off. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay at all, and could be easily repainted if it bothers you. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll provide pics if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in purchasing this.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a large collection and will offer shipping discounts for multiple item orders. Feel free to message me with questions.

    <notes>This was the last prototype sent to Gryphon games right before producing the latest edition. There were no stickers, so I printed see-through stickers and placed them on the board. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wooden and the actual size of the final piece produced, with wooden _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;stopper_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pegs on the last three _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;tongues_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (X4 spots)
There are NO DICE, NO BOX, and NO RULES. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed a one-page rule sheet which I can include if you like. 
The wood is dusty and a bit dirty, but can be cleaned as it is slick. This is a very usable copy of the game!
I will ship via USPS after payment is received. I charge only exact shipping costs. I will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.

    <notes>Nash version.  Box is huge. It will come in its box wrapped in brown shipping paper. It was shipped to me in its box and it did fine. Box is fine but looks like it was shipped and stored in box. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect museum gift wrapping.
Shipping is flat $25. More than that, I pay. Less gets a refund. Pittsburgh pickup gets a $5.00 discount of the game price.
Postal money order only. If you send any other brand, I will not ship.</notes>

From what I understand, the newer editions (after this one) were made more cheaply _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; tend to warp. This edition is very solid _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; will withstand the test of time if stored caringly. I have to sell this to clear some shelf space (unfortunately)- it needs a good home.</notes>
