   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Iron Dragon takes railroading games where they have never gone before _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; to a land filled with elves, cat-people, trolls and magic. Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Based on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

IRON DRAGON (EMPIRE BUILDER SERIES)
Science, fantasy, and trains mix in the popular game of fun and finances, Iron Dragon. Players lay track across a mythical realm filled with wizards, elves, and rainbow bridges. Genetically-engineered dragons pull boxcars loaded with jewels, magical items, and other treasures from city to city. Dangerous jungles must be crossed, rivers forged, and orcs bribed, as players plan routes and amass money in an attempt to create a fantasy empire. Building foremen (elves, dwarves, nomes) enable you to build across the world and make every game a new adventure through unknown territory.
Iron Dragon contains: 1 plastic laminated mounted board, 184 playing cards, paper money, 100 commodity chips with labels, 6 pawns, 6 wipe-off crayons, and a rulebook.
For 2 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult. </notes>

    <notes>This game is in excellent shape, however the crayons are used and you may need to replace them after a while.  All of the pieces and money are there and they are in great shape.  The board is in good shape, too, but there is some wear on the outside of the box (corners).  All in all, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be pleased with it if I ordered it from this site as a used game. :)
You will pay exact shipping, which I will calculate by going to the post office and having it weight/measured.  At that time, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know what the cost is.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want you to get owned on shipping. :)</notes>

[b]EDIT: This listing also includes Roads _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Boats as well as its expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;cetera.  Price includes shipping.
Out of Shrink, inventoried and only played once.  
All parts are present and accounted for and all materials will be bagged since the chips tend to go all over the place if the box is in any position but flat.  Great game, but when we do finally get a crayon rail game to the table, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s usually Empire Builder and nobody_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tired of that one yet.
Paypal preferred.  Ship via USPS Flat Rate Priority to the Continental US.  International buyers welcome, but shipping will be pricier and calculated later.
If you have any other questions, feel free to geekmail me.  
I will combine shipping and offer discounts dependent on how many games you order and the total being spent.
Feel free to browse the rest of the games I have for sale and/or my collection.  I just got laid off and need cash quick so if I have a buyer already interested, I can probably be convinced to part with almost anything in my collection.
Thanks,

    <notes>This game is hardly used, I remember playing like 2 to 3 time max. The crayon is hardly used (as can be seen in the pictures). The stack of money is also like new. It is completed as I have counted it and make sure. The sticker has been applied to the chips, but like all Mayfair games, the sticker can lose their adhesiveness overtime, so some may have been a little bit lose, but overall they are in like new condition. I also include the leftover sticker sheet and the spare chips, so that you can use them if needed.
The box of the game is also in very good to like new condition. It may have little wear here and there due to storage or moving around, but nothing is broken or major.
Buyers pay actual shipping cost. I actually round up the cost to the nearest dollar (to cover gas and time expense).
Please contact me for any questions. </notes>

Description: Game is complete and in great shape. It even includes the original Mayfair catalog and crayons as well as many photocopied reference sheets to assist in game play.
Shipping Weight: 5 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>The tiniest bit of wear on the edge of box.
The board has a tiny bit of black paper sticking to a couple spots on the the edges of the map (nothing on play area).  The black paper appears to be the paper that the board itself is wrapped in.  This had nothing to do with me.  This is exactly how I received it New.  That is, everything is pretty as I received it with the exception that the crayons are worn down from one game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s play.  Other than what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve noted the game is in pristine condition.</notes>

    <notes>Iron Dragon - Mayfair, 1994
This is missing the original rules and crayons.  The number of chips counts out correct, but several are blank, so there may be some missing but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell without the rules.  With that in mind, this game comes as is.  The box has a little dishing on top, but in good shape overall, with no split corners.  (You can contact me if you have a parts list and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll count for you.)
Shipping is available to USA and Canada at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense from zip code 97355.</notes>

Condition Notes:
Played a couple times.  One corner of box top is a bit dinged (does not affect structural integrity).  Box top has slight dishing.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).
A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

    <notes>Commodity stickers applied to chips. Super-minimal wear on all components as it has only been played ONCE.
Original rulebook however does have some wear (apparently some damage from a liquid spill, though still very much readable). Better off downloading the 2nd edition rules PDF file from Mayfair anyway, as there are lots of clarifications. Original rulebook is only 8 pages. The 2nd Edition file available online is 16.
Local pick up here in the Los Angeles south bay area (Torrance) highly encouraged if feasible, to avoid shipping costs. Otherwise will ship USPS priority mail to USA domestic. Quoted shipping is for a large flat-rate box.
If not paying with PayPal then USPS Postal Money Orders only, please.</notes>

    <notes>Edition:  First Edition (1994)
Language:  English
Condition:  Good Condition with some blemishes.  Rules have highlights with yellow highlighter underlines (does not affect legibility).  Crayons slightly used, green crayon is broken in the middle (under the paper wrap).  Some cards (few) are slightly bent.  One _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;foreman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card has accidental crayon mark that does not wipe off.  One section of board has some yellowing (probably resulting from the wiping off of the yellow crayon).  Bottom of box is intact but slightly caved in around edges (probably from stacking) some wear on outside of box and corners.
These are all aesthetical blemishes, the game is inventoried complete.  I was the sole owner and played it only once about twenty years ago.
See photos at https://goo.gl/photos/pBjEdz18hju5cbWs5
Shipping and handling:  Buyer will pay for packaging and shipping costs from Mount Vernon, WA (98273).
Generally there are two options:
1) USPS Flat Rate Medium box, $15.
2) USPS Parcel Service, Priority Mail 3 days, around $23 (depends on destination).
The game box with the bubble wrap is slightly larger than the height of the Flat Rate box. In other words, by using the Flat Rate box there is the risk of compression and damage to the box even with the bubble wrap. Parcel Service allows me to use a larger box but the cost is higher due to the cost of packaging materials.  Buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s preference.
Local Delivery:  Local pickup is available in Mount Vernon or Bellingham, WA.  I am also occasionally available for local pickup in Seattle, WA (please check first).
Payment:  Paypal from verified buyer only, with verified shipping address and matching name, no Paypal e-check payments</notes>
