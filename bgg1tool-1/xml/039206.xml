   <description>There are two very different versions of Toc Toc Woodman, and also a third edition named Click Clack Lumberjack which makes minor additions to the second edition of Toc Toc Woodman.  In each version, the object of the game revolves around using a plastic axe to tap a tree made out of individual flat segments without causing any segments to fall out of the tree._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tok Tok Woodman First edition:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A very simple dexterity game with 12 large wooden discs, a wooden axe, and a die. The discs are stacked as a tower. A player turn consists of rolling the die and then hitting the tower with the axe. For example, if you roll a five, you have to hit the fifth disc five times with the axe. The player causing the tower to fall loses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Toc Toc Woodman Second edition: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A dexterity game where nine plastic tree segments are stacked up.  Each tree segment has four bark sections around it.  On their turn, a player gets two taps with the axe to try and knock off pieces of bark from the tree segments for one point a piece. But be careful, if a tree segment comes down it's minus 5 points!

    <notes>New! A family Party Game: Toc Toc Woodman!
“ Don’t Rush~ ‘Toc! Toc!’ knock off all the BARK pieces with an AX… 
be careful~ don’t let the TREE fall!”   
Challenge your friend with the basic or the extreme versions of playing Toc Toc Woodman.
The goal of the game is to take off as many bark pieces from the trunks as possible!!!”
BASIC RULE - Receive a penalty point if you take down any of the trunk pieces but keep playing the game until there isn’t any bark pieces left on the tree trunk.
EXTREME RULE – Objective is to take off the tree barks but the game comes to an end when a trunk falls off the foundation.
Players Required: 2 to 7 players 
Components:
9*Tree Trunk pieces, 36*bark pieces,
1*Foundation, 1*Ax, 1*Instruction page
Ax, Trunk Pieces, Foundation, Bark pieces
The Gaming~
1. Place the bark pieces onto the trunks and piled them  according to Picture A and B.
 (Basic Rule – novice)
1. From the first player to the last, take turns in clockwise circle and hit the tree twice each. 
2. Earn Points by chopping the bark pieces off of the tree. Each bark piece is worth one point.
3. If a player chops a trunk piece from the tree, the player is given minus five points.  (penalty of negative five points)
4. In the first version of the basic rule:  winners are declared when they meet the following criteria.
***According the number of players, if a player earns following points, he is declared the winner and can be excused from playing any further. 
2 players – person with 16 points 
3 players – person with 16 points 
4 players – person with 16 points 
5 players – person with 16 points 
6 players – person with 16 points 
7 players – person with 16 points 
5. Game continues to be played till no bark pieces are left on the tree trunks and the winner can be declared by calculating the bark pieces as one point and the Trunk piece as minus 5 points. 
6. When the points are matched between players, the person who started the game later is declared the winner.
Extreme Rule (advanced level)
*** Same basic rule applies but if the player chops the trunk piece off, he is automatically in the last place and is eliminated from the game, so it is important to chop with precision. 
In the second version of the basic rule: winners are declared when they meet the following criteria.
According the number of players, if a player cannot meet the cutline points, he is the loser. The last player is declared by playing till the points are earned.
2 players – at least 10 points
3 players – at least 6 points
4 players – at least 5 points
5 players – at least 4 points
6 players – at least 4 points
7 players – at least 3 points
Other ways to enjoy the game
Change the rules to allow children to chop 3 times versus adults who can only chop twice. If a sort of penalty is given to the loser or a reward given to the winner, then there will be more at risk to enjoy this family oriented game.

Tok Tok is a fun, fast-paced game of dexterity that many have described as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Reverse Jenga_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. With over 10,000 copies sold in Korea, this hit game is now taking the US by storm! Play from 2-7 players as you become a woodman (or woman) trying to take down some bark (+1 point each) without knocking off the center pieces (-5 points each). You get 2 chops with the axe each turn and the game continues until all the bark is gone! </notes>

    <notes>The game has never been played. I removed the shrinkwrap to include The Golden Axe expansion. I think that the expansion had an error in packaging. The core block and bark blocks are golden, but the axe is not golden - it is the same color as the axe in the base game. The box has some creasing - that is the way it was shipped to me. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>
