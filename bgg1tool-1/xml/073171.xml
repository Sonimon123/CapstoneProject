    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7060)
After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster.
12 highly detailed miniatures represent the two factions which are:
NORAD: military in thinking and origins. Scientists, engineers, add to their strength.
SALEMITES: occultists working with cadavers, bringing the dead to life.
Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they can not live together in peace.
Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, escort. Through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial: There are core rules to start the game and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.
The game also contains the innovative S.A.G.S. (Scenario Auto Generating System) where 2-4 players can make their own maps and mission objectives for near infinite replayability!
Other features include:
1.A Tetris-like board construction using Tetris-shaped floor tiles.
2.An order tiles system to give commands to your miniatures
3.Interrupt Duels with Bluff, betting command points to interrupt an enemy character and act during another player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s turn.
4.The I.P.S. (Iconographic Phrasing System) which allows almost any effect to occur with icons, totally language independent.
5.Colored base arcs on miniatures to simplify Line of Sight, shooting and close combat. It also multiplies characters’ variations and possibilities.
6.The Search rule, giving a visceral feeling to searching in rooms to find equipment.
7.A Mission Points track that also serves as Morale Points track. 
8.Radio Scrambling to mess with your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; orders. </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7060)
After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster.
12 highly detailed miniatures represent the two factions which are:
NORAD: military in thinking and origins. Scientists, engineers, add to their strength.
SALEMITES: occultists working with cadavers, bringing the dead to life.
Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they can not live together in peace.
Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, escort. Through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial: There are core rules to start the game and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.
The game also contains the innovative S.A.G.S. (Scenario Auto Generating System) where 2-4 players can make their own maps and mission objectives for near infinite replayability!
Other features include:
1.A Tetris-like board construction using Tetris-shaped floor tiles.
2.An order tiles system to give commands to your miniatures
3.Interrupt Duels with Bluff, betting command points to interrupt an enemy character and act during another player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s turn.
4.The I.P.S. (Iconographic Phrasing System) which allows almost any effect to occur with icons, totally language independent.
5.Colored base arcs on miniatures to simplify Line of Sight, shooting and close combat. It also multiplies characters’ variations and possibilities.
6.The Search rule, giving a visceral feeling to searching in rooms to find equipment.
7.A Mission Points track that also serves as Morale Points track. 
8.Radio Scrambling to mess with your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; orders. </notes>

    <notes>Looks like a good game but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it as I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t realistically have the time to invest in it now that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got a baby (also need more space in the house!).  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played 3 times so is in good shape.  The rulebooks show signs of having been flicked through but other than that everything_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in pretty much tip top shape.
Shipping will be £7 as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big game.  Due to the weight I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only selling this to UK buyers - trust me, the postage costs for sending heavy packages overseas are crazy now. </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7060)
After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster.
12 highly detailed miniatures represent the two factions which are:
NORAD: military in thinking and origins. Scientists, engineers, add to their strength.
SALEMITES: occultists working with cadavers, bringing the dead to life.
Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they can not live together in peace.
Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, escort. Through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial: There are core rules to start the game and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.
The game also contains the innovative S.A.G.S. (Scenario Auto Generating System) where 2-4 players can make their own maps and mission objectives for near infinite replayability!
Other features include:
1.A Tetris-like board construction using Tetris-shaped floor tiles.
2.An order tiles system to give commands to your miniatures
3.Interrupt Duels with Bluff, betting command points to interrupt an enemy character and act during another player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s turn.
4.The I.P.S. (Iconographic Phrasing System) which allows almost any effect to occur with icons, totally language independent.
5.Colored base arcs on miniatures to simplify Line of Sight, shooting and close combat. It also multiplies characters’ variations and possibilities.
6.The Search rule, giving a visceral feeling to searching in rooms to find equipment.
7.A Mission Points track that also serves as Morale Points track. 
8.Radio Scrambling to mess with your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; orders. </notes>

    <notes>Played once, perfect condition.  There are two Plano boxes that fit inside of the original insert to hold the tokens and they fit very well (everything fits into the original box and insert, even with the Planos).  If you want both Plano boxes, please let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll add $5, otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just dump them into a few baggies.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order, total weight will be about 96oz and shipping zip code will be 30082). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING if you have any questions about shipping.</notes>

In the process of putting many games into the market, come back and check for possible combined shipping!
Shipping:
Will only ship insured!
Please ask for international shipping quote! (This may work in a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;letter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, so the shipping should be reasonable to most places...)
Payment:
Bank transfer within the EU, otherwise paypal possible.</notes>
