   <description>In Pi_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ntilde;ata, the players compete to collect the colored candy inside the pi_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ntilde;atas. Playing pieces that might otherwise be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;cubes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; are instead wooden markers with a bow-tie shape that mimics the shape of wrapped candies, coming in five different colors. When a player has collected enough candy of a given color, he earns the medal card for that color, and the first player to earn three medal cards wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players play their cards next to several mats on the table. Players usually play their cards on their side of the mats, but they may sometimes play on their opponent's side, a move that can ruin their opponent's plans._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Pi_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ntilde;ata reimplements Balloon Cup _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; while adopting the designer's initial theme for the game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; with the most significant rule changes being the addition of wild cards, the removal of a three-for-one token exchange, and a revision of the card values (but not the card count within each color).

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO493)
This is a reprint of the popular game: Balloon Cup, but with the original theme from the designer. In Balloon Cup, a.k.a. Piñata, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards - two plains alternating with two mountains - are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s side - a move that can really ruin the opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s plans. High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over - mountains becomes plains and vice-versa - and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner! </notes>
