   <description>Under the Lily Banners is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the Thirty Years War. This is the third volume from the award winning Musket _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Alerheim aka Second N_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 series rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 playbook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3 countersheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 die_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Player Aid Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

    <notes>un-punched. The mailing I use a service called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Going Postal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cottleville@goinpostal.com . They do a great job on wrapping. The cost of a typical game is about $15.00.  It is usually FedEx or Priority Mail.  If you give me an email outside of BBG I will send you a copy of the invoice for the shipping cost.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want someone to think I am making any money off on the shipping.  I would rather let the professionals do the packing.  These shipping options also include insurance as needed.  Thanks
My PayPal is game1953@att.net.

    <notes>(This one doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t weight a ton, so something could be arranged with European users with a Mondialrelay account, even with US users now that the Euro-US Dollar change is cheap: if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested write to me for the details.)
Partially punched, neatly clipped with counters in plastic ziplog bags. We only played the game twice. Paypal allowed, but buyer must cover Paypal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fee (4% of the whole total: game+shipping).
Parte de las fichas están separadas de las hojas, las esquinas recortadas, y repartidas en bolsitas. Por lo demás el juego está como nuevo.
El pago sería por transferencia o ingreso bancario. Otra opción es el pago contra reembolso, pero esto encarece el envío y supongo que acaba siendo más caro que la comisión por transferencia bancaria. No hay problema en pagar por Paypal, siempre y cuando el comprador corra con la comisión de Paypal, un 4% sobre el total, esto es, el juego+el coste del envío.
El envío se realizaría por paquete azul: son unos 8 euros que corren a cargo del comprador, pero con el paso del tiempo estos precios cambian y tendré que comprobarlo antes de cerrar el trato. El envío por Kiala (kiala.es) es otra opción más económica y cómoda que dependerá del comprador y que recomiendo por su tarifa plana de 5 euros/hasta 8 Kg.</notes>

    <notes>Unpunched and unplayed. The only reason I am not listing this game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is due to a few dings/dents and scratches to the box lid. I was tempted to list this as very good but again I do not want to be misleading about the dents to the box cover. All corners are intact just the cover itself is not like new anymore. 
The components, maps, rulebook and counters are in like new condition and the counters are all unpunched. 
Shipping will be USPS flat rate priority unless the buyer has a specific shipping preference. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>unplayed, unpunched, Box shows some small scuffing on one side and on the top right corner.
Payment: Bank transfer (EU) or PayPal (+ 3 / 5 % extra due to PP-fee)
Shipping via German Postal shipping, insured and trackable
Shipping costs: Shipping costs will be based on actual costs when shipping the game.
FYI calculate the following: Germany: 8,00 € / EU (no Isle): 17,00 € / World: 2 - 3 times EU
I withhold the right to deny shipping to countries with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;problematic postal-services_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; unless one is willing to take the risks (means: no insurance if German Postal denies it, no refund whatsoever).</notes>
