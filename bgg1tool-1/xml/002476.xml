   <description>Industrial Waste is a fast but deep game designed by Jürgen Strohm in which the players are running factories. Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions. The first player to grow their factory to a value of twenty triggers the end and the player with the most points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the German version, Müll _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Money, although the components themselves are language-independant and this copy comes with a printout of an English translation. Although the game has been played, it is generally in at lest excellent condition: the box is extremely clean with just a touch of corner wear, the cards show a bit of edge wear but no damage, and the money still looks great. The boards are like-new.
Shipping weight is 2lb 8oz. Shipping will be $6.66 (Parcel Post) or $9.00 (Priority Mail) in the US.</notes>

The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

My late husband was a board game collector, his collection can be seen on BGG, user Kimbo.  He passed away in 2012 and the time has come for me to start selling some of his games.  He was an avid collector and kept all games in pristine condition.

Very good condition.  Played several times.  Cards are sleeved.
Game box weighs 1 lb 13 oz, measures 12.5 x 9 x 3, and ships from 53597. Will ship via USPS Priority or UPS; if the latter, shipping box will be at least 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; larger than each game dimension. You can calculate shipping cost estimates via USPS.com or UPS.com.
Payment via PayPal or Amazon gift card, depending on your level of BGG market feedback.</notes>

    <notes>I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see any damage to the box or contents. All _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Euro_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; bills and game bits are present. I would also give this to a friend as a gift, so I figure it is in Very Good condition. The only oddity is that when I place my nose very close to the interior of the box, I am able to catch a faint whiff that smells like chocolate M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;Ms. Kept in pet-free (or I would be sneezing) and smoke-free homes. Weight of box and game: 2 lbs 10.6 oz. Predicted weight once packed, addressed, and taped: 2 lbs 12-13 ounces. My zip code is 97303. But I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to give you a shipping estimate if you give me your zip code.
If you pay with cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check, money order or personal check, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to wait for it to clear prior to sending.</notes>
