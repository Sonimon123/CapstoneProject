   <description>The Mighty Endeavor is the 17th game in the Standard Combat Series (SCS), and covers the Western Allied Invasion of France in 1944, the crossing of the Rhine River in early 1945 and the final push into Germany._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players can land at the places of their choosing and manner along the coast of France in an effort to liberate France and the Low Countries from German occupation and to cross the Rhine and take the German industrial cities along that river._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Mighty Endeavor - expanded edition is both an updated version (with errata corrected, a couple of counters added, and other counters made to conform to the Expansion) covering the Western Front from the D-Day landings until the end of April 1945 and an expansion to the original game that adds the Eastern Front from just east of Warsaw during the same time period and a small map attachment that adds the Brittany Peninsula._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Following the same allocation of responsibilities as the game Battle for Germany (SPI, 1975), one player controls the Western Allies and the East Front Germans while the other controls the Russians and the West Front Germans. The two players compete by seeing which grouping of Allies can conquer as much German territory as possible_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;while they also play against their opponent to stop the opposite front. Never a dull moment as both players are always playing one side or the other at the same time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The scenarios start the campaign at various points and as an added feature, the game includes a 16 Dec 44 (Bulge) campaign start for the Western Front._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Turn: 10 to 15 days_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hex: 15 miles / 24.1 Km_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units: Company to Corps_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contents (Original edition):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One countersheet (280 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; dual-side printed counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 8-page SCS-specific series rulebook _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 16-page TME specific rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contents (Expanded edition):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 22 x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 22 x 28_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 8.5 x 11_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color map  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two countersheets (560 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; dual-side printed counters)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 8-page SCS-specific v1.7 rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 16-page TME-revised specific rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 16-page TME-Expansion rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(source: MMP website and user's description)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

CONDITION: Like new, contents mint, unused and complete, with unpunched counters. The box has a dent / crease on one side, but is otherwise perfect
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  ¬£4.50
European Postage: ¬£6.00
Rest of World Postage: ¬£11.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS: 
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment. 
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice. 
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS: 
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently ¬£39 per package for Small Packets, ¬£150 for International Standard).

Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m prepared to listen to an offer, and would be more likely to consider if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying several game. Low-ball offers are likely to be ignored.
*** All games on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; list will be listed eventually - feel free to look through them and make offers ***
Shipping is done from 33947 via USPS Priority or Ground service, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to keep your costs down using Flat-rate and Regional-rate boxes if that works out cheapest. If you want a rough estimate of the shipping cost use the calculator at usps.com. Total the weight of all the games, then add a lb or two for the box plus packing materials. I ship to mainland US addresses only. (A couple of bad experiences.)
Payments via personal PayPal transfers are preferred (extra charged for cover any fees), but checks, money orders, cash, and other options considered. 
Not looking for any trades at this point, but may consider 18xx games.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so a purchase from me will always be packed professionally and I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
And if you want this game plus anything else that I am selling on BGG, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll of course be happy to add other items on in order to save you on shipping!
