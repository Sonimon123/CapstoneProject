   <description>A plastic tiki idol is placed in the raised middle of a molded, 3d board, where it can rotate freely. Players move their explorer pawns up the sides of the mountain along paths and through caves, trying to reach the top of the mountain, retrieve the idol's giant ruby, and take it down the other side to the waiting boat. However, both the idol and volcanic vents throughout the board periodically spit out _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fireball_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; marbles, which physically roll down the mountain, either plowing through explorer pawns in their path, or toppling triggered bridges as they pass under them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>FIREBALL ISLAND made by Milton Bradley in 1986.  Complete with all original parts including gameboard, idol, 4 adventurers, 5 red marbles, 4 tokens, red gem, 2 bridges with stands, die, 48 cards and rulebook.  Game condition looks like it was played once or twice, then put away.  Cards have no creases or tears and all pieces are unbroken.  Box is beat up though complete.  Shipping weight is 5 pounds.</notes>

    <notes>This game is mostly complete, but it is missing some of the marbles, and some of the gem holders. I think everything else is present, though the box has seen some wear.  The game board itself is just fine, and all bridges and bridge parts are intact.  All the cards are present, though they have seen wear.  Shipping is calculated based on where you live. I can send it via Priority Mail if you live in the US. Feel free to ask questions!</notes>

    <notes>Acceptable condition. Box is a bit crunched from having other games stored on top of it. Missing one card and one plastic token; these are not crucial components. Otherwise complete and in great shape. Seems almost unplayed.
Buyer pays actual shipping costs. I package games very carefully to avoid damage in shipment.</notes>

    <notes>This is really Fireball Island 1.25. As you can see in the photo - you get 2 boards, 2 tikis and 4 bridges. The cards are complete with some extras added in. The only missing piece is one black octagon which is honestly not very necessary to play the game. One board is slightly faded (just how it was printed), the other board is very colourful but both are in excellent condition. There is only one box which is in acceptable condition but certainly aged. I will ship everything in a solid cardboard box - well packaged.</notes>

100% complete (one marble has been replaced). Components in great shape, box a bit beat up.
The game, while relatively light is very large. Just an FYI regarding shipping.

    <notes>Catch the fireball!!!  The game is alot bigger that I thought it would be based on BGG pictures of it!  The marbles rolling down the volcano taking out explorers is soemthing to behold and that idol is just cool.
The 3D board looks as if it has never been used... No cracks, scratches, or blemishes - the graphics are like mint.  All parts are included and in excellent condition except the original rulebook that has been replaced with a scanned printed copy.  The box is fully intact with the only flaw being a slight puncture in the back and a little clear tape that once held the box shut for storage.  I left the tape on to be removed by the owner if warranted.
Shipping is $15.50 anywhere in the continental US.  Please geekmail me with any questions regarding the game.</notes>

    <notes>First the bad news:
- Box has seen better days; some crushing damage on top, tape and markings present as well. Still holds the game and is structurally sound (if sagging) but definitely not something for a collector.
- Original rulebook is missing and replaced with a printout.
Now the good news:
- Everything else is complete and in good/very good condition. (Cards show normal wear from use.)

    <notes>This is the American Milton Bradley edition. The box shows shelf wear and is torn on the lower left corner. the cover art is clear and intact. The board is in excellent shape. The card deck is complete and in good shape. There are two pieces missing: one of the four hexagonal black tokens, and one of the five red marbles for which I have substituted an orange one. All other pieces in very good condition. Complete copy of the rules is included.
I will provide an accurate shipping quote if you send me your zipcode. I do combine shipping for multiple items.

    <notes>Dutch version, though apart from the rules and easily translated cards the game is language independent. Fully complete, all components are accounted for. The box has some wear and tear and some damage to the corners, but is overall in quite good shape.
Shipping: This box is HUGE, though not particularly heavy. I can wrap it in bubble wrap and brown paper and shipping costs would be €6,75 for Netherlands, between €8,50 and €11,05 (depending on country) for the rest of Europe, €17,10 for Russia and the rest of the world.
If you want I can also try to hunt down an outer box big enough for this one, though that would likely put it above 2 kgs and substantially increase shipping costs (Europe: €25,00, Russia and rest of world: €34,30, Track _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Trace included).
Within Europe payment by bank transfer is preferred.</notes>

    <notes>This is the nicest version of this game I have ever seen offered for sale.  It is 100% complete with the original pieces included.  The cards are all smooth and flat, all the explorers are like new and the rule book is like new.  The box is 100% clean with no tears, dings  or dents.  I count at most, 4 little scuffs from shelf wear, and the color is vivid.  Even the open end of the box is clean.  </notes>

    <notes>English version of Fireball Island.  It is missing the orange hiker, one token, and the original rules (I have printed out a copy of the rules).  All other pieces are present and in very good condition.  Cards (all 48 of them) are overall in very good condition with only a few that have minor creases in one corner.  Board has no cracks and is in really good condition but box has tear on one end flap and crushed in.  Please see photos below and I will be happy to take more photos or provide more details if wanted.  Please ask as I want you to be satisfied with your purchase.
***Postage could be rather expensive, which is why I am limiting this to US only.  Local pick up is possible if interested.  The packaged game will weigh about 5 pounds and is in a box sized 34 X 19.5 X 6.5 inches.  I will ship from zip code 21702 and will print out postage on-line, if possible,to make it as cheap as possible.  I will only charge the exact shipping costs.  However, a cost estimate shipping across country via USPS was $35 to $45.  I also checked into UPS and to send it across country would cost around $20 so that might be the preferred method. These are just examples and worse case scenarios since they are across the country.  If you live closer to Maryland these should be cheaper.  Send me a geekmail if you want me to figure out the postage cost or figure it out yourself from the mail website.</notes>

    <notes>Saved for user Polelle!
***New account users please see guidelines below.  You must contact me with a valid email prior to confirmation of the sale***
***Sorry, this sale is for continental U.S. due to the large box size***
Components 100% complete and in excellent shape.  Explorers all complete and have not been glued back together.  Cards in good shape with only minor wear but no obvious folds or tears. Original marbles and rules.  Box has slight depression in one corner and wear on one edge (see pic).
**Free shipping via Standard Post within Continental U.S.  If you want Priority I can do that but costs could be an extra $50.00 depending upon your location.  I live in Maryland and would only charge exact shipping but due to the oversize box the Priority shipping is expensive.**</notes>

* 1 marble
* 1 high quality replacement pawn
* 1 replacement bridge. The original bridge is still included, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s base has been lost. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a handyman which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not, you might fix and use the original bridge, although the replacement works very well!</notes>
