Enter At Your Own Risk!
Tomb pits opponents against one another in a fast paced board game of monsters, traps, and treasures.  After assembling your party from a plethora of random characters in the Inn, you set out into the Tomb.  The Tomb is created as the game begins, with each player hiding treasure, traps, and monsters in each crypt, unknown to the other players.  Do you remember where you left the chest of gold?  Better hope your opponent didn’t put a Pain Eater in the same crypt!  No rogues at the Inn today?  Hope you don’t run into a poison dart trap! Tomb captures the fast-paced feel of a dungeon crawl without the hours of set up before hand.  Just grab your party and go.
Each character brings unique abilities, and with the map changing every game as well as the available characters, no two games will ever be the same.</notes>
