   <description>From Hangman Games' web site:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Tahuantinsuyu is the Quechua or Inca word for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Land of the Four Regions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. It is what the Inca called their own empire. The empire was organized as a pyramid-shaped hierarchy with the Sapa Inca as the supreme ruler, followed by the four Apus, who were followed by the Hahua Incas, etc. To play, you assume the role of one of the Apus (a leader of one of the four regions or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Suyus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;). Your job is to increase your status in the eyes of the Sapa Inca by doing the best job of expanding and improving the empire. Each Apu begins with the manpower of their quadrant of the original empire. You build roads and conquer neighboring regions, thereby increasing the manpower and available resources. Apus are rewarded for each new region added to the empire, for improvements such as terraces, garrisons, cities, and temples, and for connecting road systems to all of the improvements throughout the empire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Inca Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is brand new, is in the same condition as when purchased and has never been used.  Please keep in mind that Hangman Games did not shrinkwrap this game so it appears that I opened it even though it is new.
Cost listed includes shipping. I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.

    <notes>Tahuantinsuyu (2004) from Hangman Games
The game is brand new and has never been played. The pieces and cards are all sorted and stored in plastic bags for safety and convenience - you will be very pleased with how the game is packaged!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>The board is in new and mint condition because I used a special clear, thin-plastic overlay sheet taped on to the table (on top of the original board) for using dry erase markers.  This is not Plexiglas, which in my opinion is too thick.
[Including the dry-erase markers and special thin overlay sheet is negotiable, but if included it will be rolled up into a slightly larger box.]
Shipping is $20 in USA, with delivery confirmation.  
Canada shipping costs more. 
I accept the following payments:
*  money order or cashiers check. 
*  personal check (if you have good trade rating). 
*  Paypal from bank account ONLY (No Credit Cards). 
I will ship your order when funds clear my account.  
Email if you have any questions.
Thank you for looking.

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>This is the original Hangman Games edition.  This is limited edition printing #881.
The game is no longer in shrinkwrap, but it is unplayed. The Local Culture Marker stickers are still on the original sticker sheet.
The game box is in excellent condition.  However, there a few crayon marks on the inside of the box.  The crayons were loose during the original shipping of the game.  There a few crayon marks on the sides of the game box (interior of box) and a few on the game box bottom (interior of box as well).
(BTW, the crayons are now bagged!!)
There is one little crayon mark on the front page of the rules as well as a few crayon marks on the back of 3 Player Overlay Card.  The front of the Overlay Card is just fine.
The main gameboard is also in excellent condition.  All components were bagged during transit.  All components are accounted for including all 32 Sun Event Cards.
This game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>
