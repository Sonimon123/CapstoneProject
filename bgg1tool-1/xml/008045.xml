   <description>Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Now OOP and extremely hard to find in both North America and Europe, the price on this is only going to go up given more time. 
Game has been punched and sorted, only played a couple of times, and all components are in very good shape, as is the box.
Shipping costs will be true, and based on your chosen options and speed. I ship via USPS. Your options are Parcel Post or Priority and any other extras you would like such as Insurance or Delivery Confirmation.
I pride myself on a fast turnaround time, and am almost always able to get orders out within 1 business day of receiving payment.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new Princes of the Renaissance from Warfrog. The game is unplayed and still in shrinkwrap and is in excellent condition. Shipping is 6.00$ USD for Canada and 8.00 to 10.00$ USD for the USA (contact me for rates outside north-america). I prefer Paypal for payment (at no extra fees) but I can work something else (but ABSOLUTELY no cash, personal check or COD. US money orders needs to be internationnal).

    <notes>I am selling this excellent out-of-print multiplayer game because I no longer have adversaries to play with. I am doomed to play solitaire and this game with bidding and bluffing you cannot play on your own. The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition  is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I marked the starting positions on the City Status Track with a pencil so I decided to change the condition to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The counters and other pieces though I stored in a plastic counter tray that originally was not included. I also copied and increased the size of the FAMILY TILES so every player around the table can have a look at their abilities all the time. With pain in my heart I have to say goodbye to this beauty that will otherwise be hanging around in my gaming room without being played. By the way the rules are in ENGLISH and in GERMAN.</notes>

Thank you for your generous bid.
Hello, these are the game(s) you won in my recent auction.  Please respond with the mailing address you want this shipped to (or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be picking it up from me) so I know how much to charge you for shipping.
If you have a strong shipping preference please let me know else I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just go with whatever is cheapest.
If you plan on picking them up from me in Dallas or San Antonio please let me know, if you haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t already.
Thanks for your bids and hope this finds you well.
Allen

    <notes>Game is in pristine condition.  This game was purchased by me as new in shrink and has since only been played once (by me as a learning game).  The cardboard components are expertly punched out, the board shows no signs of warping.  This is an excellent example of a great and hard to find game.  Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Open but unpunched.  I purchased the game from someone who never played it and thought it desirved to be played.  Well, I have had it for a year and never played it. So, again this game is looking for a new home where it will get played. The game has a little shelf ware with some scuffs on the corners. Other than that it is in very good shape. I accept Paypal and will ship worldwide. Shipping in the US will be $12. Contact me first for outside the US.</notes>

    <notes>Box has a few dents on edges and minimal shelfwear. Contents are in excellent condition and complete except that I replaced the two black pawns (wars fought and current player) with two white discs as they stand out better and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get knocked over. The incorrect text on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Steal gold shipment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; treachery tiles have been carefully stickered. All the tiles (except the six original leader tiles) plus the dice and condottiere markers are contained neatly in a box with a clear plastic lid. Downloaded variant tiles for leaders and scoring plus my own variant leader abilities/strength counters are included. High resolution photos of the game can be seen in my user gallery.

    <notes>I think this game is close to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but I have listed it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to be on the safe side. The shrink wrap has been removed but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never been played. All bar a couple of the counters are unpunched - the punched ones simply fell out of their frame when I lifted it out of the box. There is very marginal wear on the box corners (caused by years of storage/transit) but that is all.
Shipping will be at cost. Let me know where you live and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll provide shipping estimates and options. 
UK buyers can pay by Paypal, personal cheque or COD. Overseas buyers Paypal only please. </notes>

    <notes>I bought this punched, but it looks unplayed, and I never got it to the table. (Bwah) I confirmed that all the components are present, and are in pristine shape. 
Box is solid at all corners, although the box top lower left corner is a little compressed, and there is a slight compression crease on the box bottom lower right corner. The previous owner wrote his name in the inside of the box top with a black marker. The original rules are missing, but a print out is included.
Overall, I would have rated it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Excellent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, but the writing and missing rules brings to down to just _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.

    <notes>Includes the expansion pack (classed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;multilingual_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, but that applies to the rules - some of the tiles have German text on them; not much and easily translated/remembered).

    <notes>Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from Chicago, IL, USA. Local pickup is available.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>
