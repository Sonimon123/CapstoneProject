These adventures are designed in a sort of paragraph system, with the player to your left reading what happens to you and exposing the choices you have - choices that then lead to other paragraphs or outcomes. The characters evolve during their adventures, acquiring skills of various degrees of advancement to open up new options and various _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;statuses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (such as married, despondent, cursed, etc) which also affect play.

    <notes>DESCRIPTION: Box is in used condition, with some scuffed edges. The board, counters, cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Book of Tales_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, etc. are, however, in excellent condition, and appear unused. (Please see photographs 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 2).
IMPORTANT: However, there is a (tea? coffee?) stain on the front of the rule book. (Please see the third photograph, which clearly shows this, as I want to ensure any potential buyer knows exactly what they are purchasing). The stain does not affect the legibility of any of the rules, and is only present on the rules booklet, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Book of Tales_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is unspoiled and in excellent condition.
ABOUT ME: Please see my 100% positive feedback on eBay: username _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ptdavies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;.
PAYMENT AND SHIPPING. Although resident in the UK, I will ship worldwide, and will notify the purchaser of shipping costs asap. Please pay with PayPal (no surcharges).

    <notes>West End Games English Edition in excellent condition.  Pieces are all included and in excellent condition, including the board.  When I received the game from an ebay auction, the game had never been played and the pieces were unpunched.  I separated and bagged the components and played the game once.  The outside box has a crease on it along the top, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect the contents of the box.  Both owners were non-smoking households.  Buyer to pay shipping cost from 12207 zip code in New York State.</notes>

    <notes>Game is rated good only because the box shows some wear (see photo). Inside all the components are present and I doubt it was ever played. Quite a few counters still unseperated. Great condition for a hard to find game like this one.
In addition the former owner included cards in German language and German rules.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.</notes>

    <notes>This is the edition Erlkonig version from Germany, completely updated with English paste-ups and a printed English book of tales. It is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because I have obviously made these modifications. I spent many, many hours laboriously applying English paste-ups to all the little chits and cards and board. It was an exercise in perfectionism, and very well done. The game comes with the German book of tales, and the English book of tales I will include in a separate 3-ring binder. We only began one game, and it lasted for about 15 minutes, so the game is pretty pristine.
Please let me know if you have questions.</notes>

I have NEVER played TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS by West End Games. Counters are unpunched, Cards are punched. The board is MINT as are the rulebook and the rest. The box is in perfect condition, but has a very slight scratch on the front(about 5 cm). A copy of German rules (translated) is also included. Shipping: Germany 6 Euro. EU in Europe: 17 Euro. Rest of Europe: 30 Euro. USA, Canada: 35 Euro. Rest of the World: 40 Euro. International Paying per PayPal, in Europe and Germany bank transfer too - auch per Überweisung. Perfekt erhaltene Ausgabe von TALES OF ARABIAN NIGHTS von West End Games mit deutscher Spielregel inklusive. Alles in Top-Zustand (Counter noch nicht herausgebrochen), aber ein ganz schmaler 5cm-Kratzer vorne auf der sonst tadellosen Box.</notes>

The box has taken a little battering over the years, but there are no splits.
This game has been played often, so there is some scuffing on the game board, otherwise, it is in very good condition.

    <notes>West End Games Edition. All pieces accounted for and in excellent condition (no creases on the cards) and approximately 50% of the counters unpunched.  Map is bright without any tears or stains although needs to be pressed each time to stay flat (my other copy is the same so I figure it is normal for this edition).  Box top is in good condition with some wear along the edges and one corner has a little more wear than the others.  Box bottom has some caving in one corner but no torn corners. See pictures below and I will send more photos if asked.  I charge only exact USPS shipping costs from zip code 21702.  Packaged game weighs 2 lbs 15 oz so you can calculate the shipping costs.  I will ship overseas if you are willing to pay the higher shipping costs and assume responsibility for any loss, although I have never had any problem shipping games overseas.  If you have any questions, please ask.  Please look at my other games for sale and save on combined shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This is a *serious* paste-up job of the original German version of the game (Geschichten aus 1001 Nacht).  But it is much more than a paste-up.
The Book Of Tales that originally came with the game (which would have been in German) is missing, but it has been replaced with a binder that contains the print-out of the *expanded* English book of Tales. This was done by the original (English-speaking) designer. The discussion of The Book of Tales and the paste-up in general can be read here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/84657/totan-availability...
*Everything* - the board, the cards, the counters - has been pasted up with (well-done and good-looking) stickers; with the exception of a few of the Condition Cards, but the ones that don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have stickers are translated on an enclosed sheet.
The original rules (which would have been in German) are missing, but I have a print-out of the West End Games English version of the rules included.</notes>

    <notes>First West End Games edition. 
Counters punched and bagged. Most components in very good condition, especially the map, which looks new. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Book of Tales_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; looks to have been more heavily read.
The box is undamaged but lid is bowed.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>Old 1985 version. Between the low production quality and the age of this game, it definitely has some wear. The box is heavily worn with a tear in one corner. The cards are worn. Otherwise, the components are in fair condition (the board and books). 
Buyer pays shipping from 93003.

    <notes>The game is actually unpunched and all components like new. The box has been on the bottom of a stack and so the lid is crushed. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s completely serviceable as a box but the paper is scuffed and torn in a few places.</notes>

Will ship worldwide 
Within Germany - 6,99€ via DHL
Outside Germany - please contact me first so we can agree on a shipping price everyone is happy with :-)</notes>
