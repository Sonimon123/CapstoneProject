   <description>Just outside Meeptropolis, several meeples on a camping trip are attacked by a swarm of giant radioactive butterflies.

    <notes>In excellent condition, I only played it once.  Better than new, because I applied those stickers, and that wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t exactly easy.  I was very careful, and all stickers are on in an careful way, centered on the meeples, etc.
Includes the Kickstarter Sidekick expansion.  
Buyer Prepays plus USPS Priority Shipping.  Probably about $12 but we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll weigh it and confirm what box it fits in before quoting final shipping charge.</notes>

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZMUTM)
Just outside Meeptropolis, several meeples on a camping trip are attacked by a swarm of giant radioactive butterflies. As a result, they all gain super speed and one other unique superpower, turning them into...Mutant Meeples! The city of Meeptropolis has long been in decay, with crimes happening one after the other all over the city. The city council has asked YOU to put together the best possible team of Mutant Meeples to serve as protectors for their fine city. Mutant Meeples is a puzzle game in the vein of Ricochet Robots in which players are looking to find the shortest _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;path_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to get their meeples to the scene of the crime before any of the other players, using a clever combination of Mutant Meeples and their unique superpowers and super speed.
