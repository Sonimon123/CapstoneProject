   <description>This game attaches an interesting theme to a fairly standard Rummy framework.  Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders.  Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is #1 in the Mystery Rummy series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Cards are in great shape, but the box is a bit crushed/torn. They used an oddly shaped folded insert to the hold the cards and it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hold up to use. Definitely playable, but maybe not for a collector.</notes>

    <notes>U.S. Games Systems, Inc. (USG MR100)
This game attaches an interesting theme to a fairly standard Rummy framework. Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders. Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance.</notes>

    <notes>Cards are very good, but the box is good - so, good it is.
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

This game attaches an interesting theme to a fairly standard Rummy framework. Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders. Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance. </notes>

    <notes>Game components are complete and in excellent condition.  Box is extremely lightweight and therefore has dishing, multiple creases, and moderate wear.
Shipping will be actual USPS charge to any US address. We will also combine shipping if you buy multiple items. 
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in South America, we can also ship it directly from Ecuador.  I have no idea how much that will cost, and it may take us a few days to figure out how to navigate the Ecuadorian postal system.

    <notes>cards are like new, box has some wear on back but only when looking at slanted under certain lighting, the top _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;fold in flap_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; of the box top has tiny wear, less than 1/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;rips_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; to the pre cut at the fold, very similar to a normal box for a regular deck of cards, this to me i would rate as jsut short of like new</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101468N)
This game attaches an interesting theme to a fairly standard Rummy framework. Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders. Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance.</notes>

Reserved for zastrygon for pickup at Gen Con
Please submit payment via PayPal, Google Wallet or Venmo to gramaw@gmail.com.  Alternatively, you may pay, via one of these methods or COD, directly at the convention.  
Since I am selling so many games I plan to meet as many buyers as possible on Saturday morning at 9AM outside of hall A on level 1 of the convention center, near room 128 (this was the former location of multiple Gen Con Math trade meetups, in case you are familiar.)  You can find a link to a map of the denoted area here:    https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4236187/gramaw
If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>

    <notes>The first game in this series of Rummy-based card games throws us into late Victorian London and the depredations of the ripper. Sets of evidence cards implicate the different suspects, alibis may excuse them, but can you get the right man (or woman)?
