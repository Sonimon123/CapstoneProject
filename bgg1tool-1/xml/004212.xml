   <description>This is the second game in the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. It covers the Antietam campaign._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(from the back of the box:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This simulation of the Antietam campaign is the second volume in Avalon hill's new series of strategic Civil War games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unlike most Civil War games, which concentrate on specific battles, Here Come the Rebels! portrays an entire two-week military campaign. The Confederate player's objective is to secure Maryland for the South, the Union player's goal is to drive the Rebel army out of Maryland. Here Come the Rebels! is easy to learn, and several scenarios can be played to completion in an hour._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The two beautiful maps in the game portray northern Virginia and Maryland as it was in 1862, including roads, turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains, cities, and towns. These highly accurate maps are based on original Civil War maps in state and county archives. In the game, players control Union and Confederate armies in turns representing one day of real time. The game's interactive system of play assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting and competitive. An extensive historical article, detailing the day-to-day activities of the actual campaign, is included in the game. Here Come the Rebels! is sure to appeal to all those with an interest in this dynamic period of American history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;FEATURES _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Corps Leaders * Infantry and Cavalry units _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Artillery values * Union forts * Railroad movement _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Force marches * Burning Railroad stations * Rain _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Union command paralysis * Union garrison of Harpers Ferry _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Flank attacks * Grand assaults _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Depots * Foraging * Pennsylvania Militia _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     C_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;O Canal aqueduct_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SCENARIOS _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     South Mountain _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Harpers Ferry-Crampton's Gap _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     McClellan's Opportunity _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The Baltimore Raid _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The Battle for Washington _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     From Frederick to Sharpsburg (Advanced Game, short version) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     The Maryland Campaign (Advanced Game, long version) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     How to Join Stonewall Jackson's Way (Volume I) with 'Here Come the Rebels! _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;CONTENTS: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Counter Sheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Mapsheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rules Booklet _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Charts and Tables Cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3 Display Cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 6-sided dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Counter Tray_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE: One day per turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE: One mile per hex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE: Divisions and brigades (with corps leaders)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;PLAYERS: One, two, or teams_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;PLAYING TIME: 1 hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 12 hours for other scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a 1993 Avalon Hill edition. The game is complete and the pieces are unpunched. All components are in excellent condition and appear never to have been handled or played. The only thing wrong with this set is there is some corner wear to all 4 box top corners and one of the corners taped where it split. The box bottom shows some water damage (contents completely untouched by water as the plastic tray must have been in the bottom of the box).
The top of the box is still shiny and looks great.
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is $8.50 via USPS Priority Mail to all 50 states. Combined shipping may be available on multiple purchases. Other shipping arrangements are available upon request but may vary in cost. Pennsylvania shipping addresses should include 6% sales tax.
**VERY FAST SHIPPING - 2-4 business days once payment received**

    <notes>Game is unpunched like new. It has very very very minium shelf wear if any. It looks like the shink just came off. Insurance is up to buyer. I am not liable for any damage like a bolt of lightning. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about what it would take to damage one of my packed games. My dear wife calls it over kill I call it responsible. The price of the game is $50.00. We will discuss shipping. Thank you for looking at my games. Please by them all! LOL!

    <notes>Punched and sorted into two Avalon Hill counter trays.  Map has been trimmed.  Some counters have been clipped.
Box has a small nick on the side.  The west map has three small smudges where tape was applied.  I got it that way, I wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stupid enough to put tape on the map.  Has no effect on game play.
Bonus: In addition to the counter trays it also includes a laminated map section for the area south of D.C.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and in very good condition.  Map borders that connect to the other maps within the GCACW series have gray trimmed away so they fit perfectly.  Rulebook has several exacto knife marks/cuts through a few pages, but doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect readability.  A few passages have been highlighted and one or two stains.  Dropping price to reflect these cosmetic issues.
Game is complete, includes original counter-tray.

    <notes>Unpunched, never been played.  No shrinkwrap and I did use highlighter and just a couple places in the rules.  Otherwise this is in perfect, as-new condition.  Looks like a really good game, and the wonderful quality of the game maps are among the best in all of the wargaming world.
Shipping (from Illinois) is extra.  Might deliver to the Chicago area.</notes>

    <notes>Punched and clipped. Played three times. 
Counters are in the original counter tray. Hard-to-find replacement counters from the Skirmisher magazine are included as a bonus. 
Box has a  small cut on one side (pic available on request) so well remedied one would never notice. 
The East map has been VERY NEATLY clipped where required to overlap with the West map. 
Shipping anywhere at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense. Paypal  or bank draft accepted.
Be aware that I am selling also other games in the GCACW series, so this is a very good chance to complete your collection if you wish.
I will do my best to reply to inquiries in one or two days, but I am often away from home on business - Sometimes without a reliable internet connection, in which case I will get back to you on my return .</notes>

Very minor wear on box lid (nearly entirely on UPC side of lid due to being stored on a shelf). Otherwise, but for this minor wear and the counters being punched, it would qualify for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.
