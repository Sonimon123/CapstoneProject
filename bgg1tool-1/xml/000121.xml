   <description>Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Designed by the creators at Eon of 'Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

It also comes with a Junta expansion on the same sheet, and a copy of the article for the Junta expansion as well.  This is NOT the base game, you must have the original games to play.  I will be listing this under Junta as well, but there is only 1 copy available so first come, first serve.</notes>

    <notes>Includes base game and both expansions - The Duel and Spice Harvest.
It is a well played set. Boxes are taped. Rules and bottom of a couple player shelds have some staining. I replaced a couple player counters using an original counter sprue and a 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; punch. Possible a couple generic number counters are missing, but shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play. 40+ sheets on included pad.
All other components (cards, character discs, boards, wheels) are present in played condition.

    <notes>The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition varies widely, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll list each part specifically:
Markers: Storm markers are punched, spice markers are punched. All other markers (units and leaders) are unpunched/pristine. A GREEN (ATREIDES) MARKER IS MISSING, otherwise all markers are present. It should be possible to cut a replacement marker out of the cardboard that remains after punching, but I leave that up to the buyer.  
Box: Shows wear and paper (not water) damage, but is unbroken. Not for display.
All other pieces (board,wheels, battle markers, shields) are in excellent condition - don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look played. 
So, in short: the box is not so good and a green marker is missing. Everything else is in excellent/unplayed condition. </notes>

    <notes>- Half punched, half unpunched.  
- Player screens never folded.
- Box shows wear.  Also was apparently once closed with scotch tape which was later torn off, damaging the box paper in two narrow strips.
- Box corners all structurally sound: no splits, no repairs.
- Missing one chit: a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on one side, white/blank on the other. For use in advanced Fremen rule where chits numbered 1-6 are placed face down in a coffee mug for a blind draw. Suggested solution: roll a d6!  Or use a double-sided _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; spice marker chit (plenty supplied) and avert gaze while drawing.

There is a little bit of tape which kept the box closed, but I have not attempted to remove the tape. You don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really notice it.

    <notes>1979 printing (sandworm cover art).
Box is in acceptable condition. Plenty of shelf wear, and (presumably) the name of a previous owner written on the front. NO corner splits. Structural integrity is good.
Contents are in good condition. Only two components are missing: Kwisatz Haderach +2 marker and storm marker for the mapboard. Everything else is here: all leaders, cards, armies, mapboards, etc. A few of the orange army pieces have been lightly written on with a pen. All other components are untouched, including the original manual and player aid pad.
Pictures of components on request.
For this item, I will ship via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. I will also insure if the buyer requests and covers the additional cost.</notes>

    <notes>The game has been played and has minor wear to some of the tokens. The box has some scuffing, the main issue being the inside box having one corner torn, but the game is complete, and the board is in excellent condition. The Cards have yellowed some over the years, but no tears or bent corners. Several pages of the Dune Player Pads are still available. The player shields are in excellent condition. The game is perfect for someone that wants to play it - collectors may want to spend more to get a box in better condition. Shipping will be actual cost based on how the buyer wants the game shipped.</notes>

    <notes>Dune from Avalon Hill, with the sandworm cover.
Complete, partially unpunched. (Most of the army counters still unpunched; it looks like someone punched a few of the leader discs out and then put them back.) Player aid pad looks unused. Board has a touch of wear. Looks like one of the shields was used but the others appear unused. Battle wheels are unassembled. Spice and Treachery cards appear to have been used.
Box is in nice shape with just some light wear at the edges.
Shipping in the US will be $10. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship outside the US via Priority Mail International at cost; please contact me for estimate.

    <notes>I have an extra thrifted copy of the 1979 Sand Worm Cover edition of this game for sale.  The box has some damage to it as you can see in the pictures.  The box is fine other than the slight crushing you see in the pictures.  In other words, it does not have any split corners.  The game board, all of the cards, the instructions, and the player shields are all in great condition.  The pad of player aid sheets is nearly full and in excellent condition.  The combat wheels are slightly bowed but it does not affect their use at all and they are otherwise in excellent shape.  As you can see in the pictures, the leader disks show wear from repeated use.  This is because I swapped them out with my other copy.  You may also notice in that picture that one of the leader disks (the 1-value Harkonnen leader) has been fabricated because the original was lost.  As you can see the fabrication is of good quality and this will not affect game play at all.  Also the Kwisatz-Haderach chit has been fabricated, but it is an excellent replacement and this does not affect game play at all.  Finally, one of the Harkonnen and one of the Fremen troop chits are a little worn.  The only piece the game is missing are the 2 clips that attach the two board pieces together.  This can be substituted for but is not actually necessary to play the game.  In sum, this is overall a very good condition player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of the game.  If you want to play the game it will work perfectly.  If you are a collector, you will want to pass on this copy.
I will ship world wide and via any method the buyer chooses.  Let me know how you want to ship and I will give you a shipping quote.  If you have any questions at all don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to Geekmail me or send me an email at: sheltonious@yahoo.com</notes>

Shrink is not totally intact, so the box has some wear on the bottom and back.  In addition, the shrink had partially tore on the bottom, and some idiot had taped it back on (years ago, so it is stuck).

    <notes>Dune from Avalon Hill in the sandworm box.
Overall condition is very good. The game components are complete and in very nice condition. Army tokens mostly unpunched. Leader tokens are either unpunched or else punched and then put back in. Spice and storm counters are punched. Board has a touch of wear. Player aid pad has maybe a few sheets missing. 
Box has some shelfwear. There is moderate wear to the edges, particularly to some of the corners, and some slight dishing to the box top. 
Shipping $10 in the US via UPS or Priority (UPS not available to AK/HI). International shipping at cost via Priority International Medium Flat Rate box. I accept Paypal (shipping to confirmed addresses only) as well as check/MO (US funds only, please). </notes>

    <notes>Dune, English language from Avalon Hill, in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Sting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; box.
Components punched, complete, in VG condition. Player aid pad has a few loose sheets but is mostly complete. Various counters, etc. have very little play wear.
Box has moderate wear to edges and corners. There is some sticker residue to the top, and the lower left corner of the top and bottom are split. Top edge of the box top has some scraping and light sun-fading. If the box were in better shape, I would call this very good.
$10 shipping in the US. International shipping at cost. You can pay with Paypal, or a check/money order (payable in US funds).

    <notes>This is a copy of the Avalon Hill _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;standard worm cover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; game of Dune (the one pictured in the main page for this game).
The pieces are in absolute excellent unplayed condition. All pieces accounted for, bagged, and stored safely.
The box is in ok condition. There is some heavy scuffing, and a small section that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s scraped up a bit where the guy is standing in the foreground. The box is fully functional and does not detract from the game whatsoever. All four corners are intact. I would give the box 6 out of 10, and the components a 9.5 out of 10 (only because they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re punched).
[b]I will also include all six of the original Dune books written by Frank Herbert. They are in lightly used condition. I will also include the 3 disc dvd SciFi channel miniseries with this game as well.[b]
All items ship together.
Shipping for this item will be $10.00 within the continental United States.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be willing to ship outside the continental US but the buyer agrees to pay the full shipping charge.
If you have any questions don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask!</notes>

    <notes>This is the Sandworm cover slightly rarer _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Red Box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version. 
Played 2 or 3 times.   Sheet of the marker counters are still unpunched (we just used discs).
US buyer agrees to pay for USPS priority mail shipping with delivery confirmation.  I doubt that I would ship this internationally.
Please geekmail me with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Dune - _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cover by Avalon Hill (1979)
Apart from shelf wear (mostly on bottom and back of box) this item is in excellent condition. The counters are unpunched except for 23 that fell off the board when I was checking it out. I bagged those.  The combat wheels are unpunched. The spice cards are unpunched except for 4 of the 21 that came detached from the main group. The player screens are unused. The player pad is full and the manual looks untouched. It even has the original registration card, AH parts and price list and a color one-sheet for a game called Heroes. Except for the treachery deck being punched I would say this game hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been handled much.
It is missing the 6 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;optional rule_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; storm movement tokens.
PayPal payments only please.
Shipping is $15 to lower 48.

    <notes>Sandworm Cover (matches 2nd photo). 
Game is in very good condition and near complete. It is missing 2 army counters (1 red and 1 orange) and 2 spice counters (both value 4) - all 4 counters can be replaced easily without effecting game play and may not even be needed. All the essentials are here and in excellent condition - map board, all 6 character shields, all 30 military leader discs (a few are still unpunched), 118 out of 120 army counters (3 colors are still unpunched), all 6 storm movement counters, 52 out of 54 spice token counters, player aid pad, a storm marker, all 21 Spice Cards, all 33 Treachery Cards, both battle wheels, and original instructions. All the spice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; treachery cards are in excellent condition with no creases or rips. Instructions have some light staining on the front cover but otherwise very good with no writing, rips or other markings. 
Box shows a fair amount of wear around the corners and edges. One corner is partially split and has been taped. Some staining/foxing to both the top and bottom but overall it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in fair condition and serves its purpose.</notes>

Game is in great shape. Some minor shelf wear on the box, with edge whitening being the most common.
All original pieces included and all in great shape. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think the player shields have even been used. Two player aid sheets have been torn off, otherwise the pad is there. The board looks new.
Truly in excellent condition considering its age.</notes>

That way you can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;flip_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sandworm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; copy… ;)

    <notes>Garage sale find. 1979 Avalon Hill edition (but apparently a later printing-- there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a 1982 AH catalog inside).
Unplayed by me, but apparently played at some point (I suspect only once) by previous owner. I counted and rebagged the components-- it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s complete except that a few pages from the player aid pad are used (90+ are left) and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know for sure how many spice tokens there should be, but there are plenty (18 1-spice, 17 2-spice, 19 4-spice).
Condition notes:
- The combat wheels are seriously bowed but (to my surprise) still spin comfortably.
- The leaders are more gently (but still visibly) warped. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all similar enough that I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry about someone _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;reading_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; them while face down at the beginning, but you still might want to pick traitors out of a pouch if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re picky. The leaders I tested did still fit into the combat wheel holes okay.
- One face of one of the green tokens has split off, i.e. one green token is not green on the back and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a very thin _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;extra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; green token.
- One edge of the player aid pad is badly curled up.
- The player shields are flat and seem untouched, except for Atreides, which has some edges that feel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;soft_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, like somebody bent them but did not crease.
- Some box wear. Like, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be proud to have kept the box in this condition for 30 years, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s scuffy around the edges and otherwise _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;looks old_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a light stain on part of the logo.
- Still includes Avalon Hill _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fall/Christmas _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;82_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; catalog. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know why you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d care, but if you do.
Note that the storm movement markers look exactly like spice markers except that they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re blank on one side; I bagged them with the leaders instead of the spice for clarity.</notes>

    <notes>1979 Sandworm version.
Some scuffing on box.  Has been played a few times - all pieces present, loads most of the player aid pad is pristine and unused.
Game shows a few signs of wear, but still a very beautiful game to own and play, from an time when Avalon Hill build-quality was superb.

    <notes>Avalon Hill sandworm edition. Complete. Box and components have wear, the box more so than the components - they are in very playable condition. Combat wheels have some bowing. As a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in pretty decent shape (I actually punched it myself eight or so years back). Shipping is $12. Combined shipping rates are available when purchasing multiple items.
When you order this game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw in one for free. See this list for your choices:

Selling at a bargain price to secure quick sale. Game has been opened and carton board chits are punched, but never played. Minimal box wear only due to being out of shrink wrap.
Large box so will also charge reasonable shipping costs to UK and Europe. Will not ship to rest of world unless you are desperate.</notes>

    <notes>Box has some shelf wear to be expected from a game of this age with corner/edge whitening and slight corner fraying.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a slight crease about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long on the upper left corner of the back of the box.
All cardboard components and board are in excellent condition.
Cards were rubberbanded for a long time, and there is a faint dark mark across the backs/fronts of the top/bottom cards on the Spice and Treachery decks of cards.  (Middle two cards in both pictures.)  The marks on the backs are barely noticeable unless the light is just right and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re really looking for it.
Player shields look like they have never been used, though the bottom/side flaps of the Bene Gesserit shield has slight tearing, and Guild shields has slight creasing.
The combat wheels have some warping, and one of the wheels has some slight indentations near the center where the pointy plastic hub of the other wheel was pressing against it.
Looks like only a couple of the player aid sheets were ever used.
Please see pictures, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve tried to capture all the flaws as best I can.</notes>

Game is in excellent condition, has been handled with TLC
My late husband was an avid board gamer and game collector.  Sadly the time has come for me to find new homes for all his games. (Except my favorites :) )  He took excellent care of all his games, no eating or drinking allowed while playing a game.  He had a huge collection, and most of his games had never even been played.  Feel free to message me with any questions or concerns.   Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>Sting cover for this Players copy of Dune (I upgraded to the French version); Good condition. Complete! Box shows tons of shelfwear, including two spots on sides wear tape was removed.  Some counters show wear or are a little grimmey, others look pristine.  Cards are in beautiful shape, as are the folding screens.  Rules only a photocopy, but you should download the best ruleset at www.starbasejeff.com anyway. Game comes with 54 spice tokens plus 6 storm tokens for a total of 60 white tokens--not 60 spice tokens like the game mistakenly states. A handful of spice tokens are from the French set, but look almost identical.

    <notes>Components are all original, complete, and in very good condition with minimal wear.  Even includes the response card and replacement parts catalog.  The battle wheels and leader discs are bowed a bit from age (and how they were manufactured).  The player aid pad is full or nearly so.  The box has moderate shelf wear with sections of heavier wear on the top and bottom sides where I assume tape was removed (see images).  Overall a very good copy of a classic game.</notes>

    <notes>I bought this game unpunched some years ago.  The wheels have come loose in the box, presumably due to the previous shipping and have some brown spots on them on the back (I can supply photos) which will not affect gameplay.
This is a very old game and it smells a bit like an old book but the components are otherwise in great conditions.
Buyer pays for shipping cost.
I am happy to supply more photos if requested.</notes>

    <notes>One of the all time greatest games. Excellent themed game. Play reflects the Frank Herbert novel well. Knowledge of the Dune universe really helps so I am throwing in as a sweetener a shrink-wrapped Blu-Ray copy of the 1984 movie starring Sting, Linda Hunt, Kyle McLachlan, Virginia Madsen, Patrick Stewart (of Star Trek fame), Max von Sydow, Jurgen Prochnow (of Das Boot), Richard Jordan, and Sean Young.
Edition: Avalon Hill _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cover 1984, English edition
Contents Condition: Unpunched. The contents have been touched only to verify completeness. Acquired in a trade but never played. All the components look great considering its age.
Box Condition: However, the box itself is not in good shape. The original owner apparently spilled something on the right side of the box, which is damaged. However, none of the game contents are affected and the box is still solid and intact with no split corners.</notes>

The box shows it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age with shelf wear and two split corners.

    <notes>This is a bundle deal for the Avalon Hill basic game of Dune plus the Duel expansion. Box boxes are included, and they show only minor shelfwear.
There once has been a French edition of Dune from Descartes Edition, and there character tokens and spin wheels included in this bundle deal originate from the French edition. Years ago I had replaced the original character tokens from AH because the multicoloured tokens from Descartes look much nicer. All other parts are original AH parts, and colour-photocopies of the differently illustrated French player screens are included as well. 
Buyers located in Germany should pay via Überweisung, international buyers can pay via Paypal. Postage in Germany is 6.99 Euro.</notes>

    <notes>Completely unplayed first edition copy of Dune (Brown Box)
This is in exceedingly good condition, purchased at a sale and never played, only punched out. There was some transportation damage incurred prior to me picking it up (Namely some minor structural damage to the lid, and one of the plastic spokes breaking and needing to be replaced). I also caused some damage by wrapping the cards in elastic bands, but this has only had problems with a single card.
All wear and tear is shown in images here: 
All components are present and basically all in impeccable condition (exceptions listed above). Outside of removing the components and putting them together, nothing has been touched. I am happy to replace the combat wheel with issues with the one from my red box edition (Which was gifted to me shortly after and why I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never played my perfect copy). It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s even still got an advertisement for Jenkos Games in the bottom of the box, just like it would have brand new.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m very good at shipping boardgames, and will make sure that your purchase arrives in as good condition as it was sent.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a complete copy of the Red Box Sandworm edition. The components are in great condition but the box has moderate to heavy shelf wear. The only things of note with the components is that the combat wheels are starting to slightly bow from age but they are completely functional. Also the player aids came as a pad of sheets similar to a pad of post-it notes and the pad has now split into 2 separate pads of player aids.  Lots of scuffs on the edges and front and back of box. Also the bottom left corner of the box top has been worn away and frayed to the point where the cardboard underneath the artwork is visible. This is definitely not a board game collectors copy, but its also not in terrible condition and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just looking to have a copy that you can play and enjoy then this is the copy for you.  Shipping will be actual cost, contact me with your zip code for a quote. I also have photos available that I can email to you if anyone would like to see details of the box wear.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Sting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cover 1984 edition, in original box with all original components.
Game has been played once by me and my friends. I bought it a decade ago, and when I got it it may never have been played - many of the cards were not separated from the sheets.
Due to the age, the box is definitely well worn - has been on several shelves as I moved. The insides are in as good condition as can be expected - all separate in ziplock bags.
You also get original manual, the glorious map and all the components. The player sheets come in a tear-off stack, and has plenty (all?) left, though a few pages have come loose in storage.
Would love for this to go to someone who will play this. Please contact me if you have any questions!</notes>

    <notes>Game is mostly unpunched, those counters that have fallen from the tree are bagged, and the cards that have separated have also been bagged.  Shields have never been assembled.  Rules have some curve to them.  Battle wheels are assembled, and one is from a separate copy.  Board clips included.  Full pad of player sheets.  Box is the primary reason listed as good.  It has some visible stains on the cover, and the right side corners have been taped.  (See picture)

Here is your chance to get everything in one purchase!  I am not willing to split them up so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all or nothing.  Here are the individual game conditions:
1. Dune base game = Everything is punched but in Good-Acceptable shape.  All components accounted for.
2. Spice Harvest = This has not been used but has been punched out.  I would rate this as being in Very Good condition.  All components accounted for.
3. The Duel = This has not been used but has been punched out.  I would rate this as being in Very Good condition.  All components accounted for.
But wait!  That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not all!  You also get the issue of Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The General_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; magazine (Volume 32, Number 1) with the rules and counters for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Grand Dune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  These are in decent shape but unpunched.

    <notes>This is a professionally created version of Dune with Ilya_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Redesign plus all existing Expansion content (Duel expansion, Spice Harvest expansion, extra 4 factions expansions).

It has also never been played so is in Like New condition.  I wish I was able to get it to the table but I am no longer close to my game group and now that I a newly wed I need to liquidate part of my collection for all my new expenses.

    <notes>This game partly punched but has obviously never been played.

Some c**t (not me) has damaged the rulebook, there is a photocopied page of the missing text.
Otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in an OK condition considering the age.
Only the game, not the pillows and the toy ape ;-)

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
The condition on this copy requires some details.  The box shows its age, but is in generally good shape. However, the previous owner taped the box top at several seams that were splitting.  The game itself looks unplayed -- the Spice and Combat tokens are unpunched, but a few have fallen out and are missing -- so the previous owner created replacements from the excess space on the counter sheet.  I did not count the sheets on the Dune Player Aid Pad, but it looks like they are all there.  The original leader disc for [i]Capitaine Iakin Nefud[/i] apparently went missing and a (color) replacement has been substituted. 
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.  AH.  Sandworm cover.  Red box.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

All components laminated, all counters clipped. The screens have never been folded, but they are punched out. The base game box shows wear because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 30 years old.

This is a home made / professionally made copy of the boardgame Dune from 1979 using the many resources here on BGG. 
The board and counters were made for me by BGG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Andrew Toulson. The board has a slightly shiny surface and each half is made up of three folding panels. The counters were printed on slightly gloss paper and stuck onto wooden disks. They are double-sided. There are also a dozen or so spare tokens. The box (also from A.T.) has some shelf wear.
The cards were printed by ArtsCow and are like new. 
Deck 1: List of leaders for each player, blank cards, treachery cards (including about a dozen extras for the two expansions)
Deck 2: Storm marker cards (optional), traitor cards, spice cards
Deck 3: Bene Gesserit prediction cards, alliance cards, Quisatz Haderach cards
Spice is represented by the yellow acryllic pieces. Small = 1 and large = 5 spice. 
The six shields are printed on card and are home made. 
The battle wheels are also home made. There are four but only two are needed. One pair are made from quite heavy card (like the original) and the other pair are made from thinner card and laminated.
There are two different sets of wooden storm markers (labelled 1 to 6) which can be drawn by the Fremen player from the drawstring bag printed with the Dune map (also courtesy of ArtsCow). There are also alternative wooden storm markers (from the cards) and nuclear explosion markers.
Rules and a crib sheet for the treachery cards are also included.
Postage within the UK will be £5.50 by Royal Mail (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;2kg, small parcel, tracked, 2-3 days, insured). Elsewhere, please ask. Payment by PayPal please unless you pay cash on collection from the Tadcaster / Leeds / York (UK) area.</notes>

    <notes>This is a fully playable, but not collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, of this rare but amazing game.  The board and main components are in good condition, with the usual signs of wear over the decades.  Some of the troop tokens (the small colored circles) are missing.  So is the storm token and the Kwisatz Haderach token.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed replacements for both of these, as well as one of the hero tokens that is damaged.  This damage doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect its playability (it still fits in the Combat Wheel).  All of the other hero tokens are in good condition.  All of the Spice and Treachery cards are present, along with the rulebook, a pad of player aids that you can write on, and everything else you need to play the game.  The back of the box contains tears.  These are taped on the inside, so the box functions just fine other than the cosmetic effect on the back.  The two combat wheels are in good condition, but one is missing the little plastic piece that holds the two boards together.  This can be easily replaced with just about anything and it will work fine.  Even though only a handful of the troop tokens are missing, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve scanned and printed a full sheet of troop tokens and spice tokens on thick cardstock.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also scanned and printed copies of the other three damaged or missing tiles.  You can cut these out and use them as is, or glue them onto thicker cardboard and then cut them out.</notes>

    <notes>Cult-classic, rare and amazing game.
This is beyond playable and should probably have been listed as Very Good. The board and main components are in great condition, with the usual signs of wear from the past decades. 
A single red troop token (small cardboard circle) is missing.  Otherwise, 119 of the 120 original troop tokens are intact and included.  
Storm movement tracker tokens (small squares labelled 1 to 6) are missing, as they were replaced by a single D6 for ease of play.  This does not hinder gameplay.   
Given the age of the game (1979), the condition of the components inside the box are beyond good, 8.5/10.  See attached picture.
While it never was busted, ripped or smashed, the outside of the box does testify of it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age while maintaining a good-enough look that one would be proud to feature this game on a shelf. 
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE MISSING, OR DAMAGED.
Original rule book, player aid sheets and even original replacement parts booklet from Avalon Hill are still in the box.
Truly a one-of-a-kind game.
