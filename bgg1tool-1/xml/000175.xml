   <description>Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one (one of the others being For Sale).  Raj was originally printed as Hol's der Geier. Its main 'simultaneous action' mechanism has been used numerous times: most recently as Sky Runner, or Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.), or even For Sale to a certain extent.  Players are given an equal deck of cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  The prize tile either has positive or negative points, and each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining fifteen cards, and reveal them simultaneously.  The highest card gets the prize (if positive), or the lowest card get the prize (if negative).  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Online Play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;      Boardspace.net Real time, against humans or robot players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hol_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Der Geier in the smallest box.
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and cards are in very good shape with minor wear.  There is minor wear and whiting to the box.  The box has one split corner that has been repaired using glue and a jig, so the corner is nice and sharp.  The box is what makes this game in good condition, rather than very good condition.
International buyers welcome, and this game is nice and light so postage will be reasonable.

    <notes>Minor shelf wear, never played.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Beat the Buzzard
Description: Beat the Buzzard card game from Ravensburger used, complete.
Shipping Weight: 1 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>UNUSUAL EDITION.
Bought new, played never, put away. In excellent condition, in shrinkwrap, never opened. English rules.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.
On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

Local Pick Up in redwood city, ca
Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one (one of the others being For Sale). Raj was originally printed as Hol_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s der Geier. Its main _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;simultaneous action_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; mechanism has been used numerous times: most recently as Sky Runner, or Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.), or even For Sale to a certain extent. Players are given an equal deck of cards from one to fifteen. Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool. The prize tile either has positive or negative points, and each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes. Players secretly select one of their remaining fifteen cards, and reveal them simultaneously. The highest card gets the prize (if positive), or the lowest card get the prize (if negative). However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line...
