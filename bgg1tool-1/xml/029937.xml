   <description>Siam 1874: A power struggle has broken out. Siam's king has initiated reforms that have resulted in a clash between the Malays, Lao, and Royalists. The appearance of unity, however, must be preserved or the British might move in and make a colony out of Siam. Will the Siamese succeed in this tightrope walk and maintain the nation of freedom?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In King of Siam, the players use action cards both to compete for influence on the contending factions and to tip the power struggle in favor of the faction where their own influence is the greatest _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but the players must be careful. Too much conflict will result in a British intervention and new victory conditions are immediately resolved._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After the initial setup King of Siam has no random elements and no luck. The game is playable by 2-3 players individually or four players in partnerships._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Of all the countries in Southeast Asia, Siam alone escaped colonization by European powers and preserved its independence._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
In 1874, the young King of Siam, Rama V Phra Maha Chulalongkorn, began a series of modernizations necessary for the country to maintain its independence, but which set off an internal power struggle between the Lao, Malays and Royalists that threatened to destablize the country, which jeopardized the very independence that the reforms were meant to preserve. 
King of Siam is a game for 2, 3, or 4 players based on that power struggle. The players vie for influence with the opposing factions and attempt to steer the faction in which their influence is greatest into power. This must be done, however, without the struggle becoming too overt, or the British can move in. 
In partnership with its publisher, Histogame, Simmons Games is delighted to be able to present Histogame’s King of Siam, an easy to learn, unique, fast-playing subtle battle of wits based on that fascinating historical struggle. The printed game materials are in English and German, and additional translations are available for download.

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Of all the countries in Southeast Asia, Siam alone escaped colonization by European powers and preserved its independence._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
In 1874, the young King of Siam, Rama V Phra Maha Chulalongkorn, began a series of modernizations necessary for the country to maintain its independence, but which set off an internal power struggle between the Lao, Malays and Royalists that threatened to destablize the country, which jeopardized the very independence that the reforms were meant to preserve.
King of Siam is a game for 2, 3, or 4 players based on that power struggle. The players vie for influence with the opposing factions and attempt to steer the faction in which their influence is greatest into power. This must be done, however, without the struggle becoming too overt, or the British can move in.
In partnership with its publisher, Histogame, Simmons Games is delighted to be able to present Histogame’s King of Siam, an easy to learn, unique, fast-playing subtle battle of wits based on that fascinating historical struggle. The printed game materials are in English and German.

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

Siam 1874: A power struggle has has broken out. Siam_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s king has initiated reforms that have resulted in a clash between the Malays, Lao, and Royalists. The appearance of unity, however, must be preserved or the British might move in and make a colony out of Siam. Will the Siamese succeed in this tightrope walk and and maintain the nation of freedom?</notes>

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition.  It is complete.  It has been played a few times but still looks like new.  The box has some slight shelf wear.
Shipping will be my cost: $11.35 (for priority).  Once USPS get parcel post back I can use that option - for now I believe it has been suspended.  I will gladly combine shipping and send you an invoice if you purchase multiple games</notes>

Shipping via U.S.P.S. Priority would cost at most $10, likely less, depending on where you live. Happy to provide exact quotes. Local pickup available in the D.C. area.</notes>

    <notes>This copy is neat, clean and complete.  It has seen just a few plays on my tabletop so the components are like new.  The box has some of that light edge-wear one doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even see at a glance, but is there if one looks for it--nothing serious.  I am a very careful packer.  I only ship in brand new cardboard boxes with generous protection, computer generated labels, USPS tracking numbers and a packing list on the outside of the box.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Played once. Cards and components are in excellent, near new condition. Box has slight shelf wear.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a small to medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.95 (small), $13.10 (medium), or $17.90 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
