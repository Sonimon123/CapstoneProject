   <description>It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and both are in short supply._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;self_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

This is for a copy of the kickstarter LEADER BOX with the Path of Progress box sleeve. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not trying to make any money on this so it is for the price I paid plus shipping. I will know what the shipping is as soon as I receive the game (depending on your location, it will probably be between $9-13). I should have this in the next 14 days according to the latest update but have not received a Funagain tracking number yet. If you purchase this I will just ship the game out as soon as I get it. I will share both the Funagain tracking and your own tracking so you can see it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s progress.</notes>

    <notes>US KS with extras - expansions, and the exo-suit minis. Copy is opened, organized, and played once. It arrived with a small dent in the corner of the box --think of it as rounding the top upper left corner, perhaps half a centimeter pushed down. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if they would mail a replacement, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re welcome to look into it, or see if they will and send to you. For purposes of this listing, though I want to disclose this. Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d describe the contents as excellent. Buyer to pay shipping from 48197. Note that this a heavy game, 10 lbs before packing. Fun game, a little complex, but fairly easy after you get that first play under your belt.</notes>

    <notes>I sell the normal Anachrony game (not the kickstarter Edition) from mindclash games.
I played it a few times and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like it. I prefer worker placement games like a feast for Odin over it.
You can also send me the money via bank transfer or paypal.
I ship world wide and I will add as shipping cost the real costs I have for shipping to your place.</notes>

    <notes>Full KS version with all KS exclusives and the Harmony leader sleeve. Box came slightly dinged in one corner, there is very minimal damage to just the box and sleeve and only in one corner. Opened the outer SW to verify contents, none are harmed and everything is complete. Pretty much everything inside the box came in SW except the rule books, so all of that is unopened. It is, of course, unpunched and unplayed.
I planned to keep it but am going to try selling, take it before I change my mind! 
Buyer pays actual shipping from MO, which might be a lot because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a very heavy game.</notes>

    <notes>Retail edition and INCLUDES the Exosuit Commander Pack. The game has been played 7 times, always in a smoke-free environment. Some of the triangle chits are showing some minor wear since they have sharp points and are held in hand during portions of play. The acrylic resource cubes are also showing internal cracking (which seems to be the case for all of the copies of Anachrony from what I have read). However, I would still say the overall condition is excellent! 
Note: the miniatures were often coming loose from the bases, and so they were glued in place to avoid this annoyance during play. I thought this was worth mentioning since some players might prefer to be able to remove the miniatures from the base for painting or some other reason perhaps.
Finally, shipping is likely to be about $20 to $25 due to the heavy weight of the game. I can ship or discard the expansion box depending on the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s preference (shipping the expansion box might be slightly more expensive than shipping only the base game box - all contents fit into the base game box).</notes>

    <notes>This is the complete Kickstarter version of Anachrony - including the minis.
I have opened, punched and organised everything but it has never been played.
Postage will be £10 in the U.K. The box is very heavy (aprox. 5kg)  so postage will be expensive outside of the U.K.
I have looked into European shipping for a few people now and it is around £25 to the following countries:
Sweden
Portugal
Italy
Belgium
I would imagine the rest of Western Europe would be similar. The problem is that once you get into the 5-10kg bracket things get really expensive to ship.</notes>

    <notes>Played 3-4 times, smoke free, no significant wear (exception: see next sentence).
IMPORTANT: the box sleeve did not survive reboxing.  The box is very, very full and that made the sleeve very very tight - too tight as it turned out!  While this is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;sleeved_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version, there is no actual sleeve.  The box itself and the contents are all fine.
This version includes the miniatures and all the expansions.  
This box is big and heavy, I anticipate shipping will be around $25.  Will compute exact shipping when the order is placed.</notes>

Ships from 44512, Its big and heavy, probably 22$ to ship. The expansion minis/manual/components fits in the base box (barely). I can drop shipping $2 if you decline wanting the expansion box since it will make it so I can ship a smaller box. If you want expansion box, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll sort it back out to their correct boxes.</notes>

Note on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition: edge of box was dinged in shipping and there are some helpful sharpie underlines in the English rulebook.
Note on Shipping: Game box measures just under 17x12x5 inches which seems to rule out large (23-11/16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 11-3/4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 5-1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) USPS flat rate boxes.

    <notes>This order is for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Kickstarter Leader_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge content with all stretch goals  ( However, I requested no faction-specific _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;path_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; exterior box sleeve.)
This is a beautiful and physically massive game, with an enormous amount of content.  Punched, sorted, and taken care of meticulously.  Everything fits in one box, tipping the scales at 8+ pounds.
What comes with it:
1) Base Game
2) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Doomsday_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Module
3) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Chronobot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Solo Play Module
4) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Pioneers of New Earth_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Module
5) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Guardians of the Council_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Module
6) Complete set of all 30 exosuites (24 faction + 6 Guardians expansion exosuites).  These things are substantial, heavy, and very nice.
7) All the small stretch-goal additions (like extra factory, timeline, building, and super-project tiles).
Final content note: My bundle did not come with the glossy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;faction histories_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; insert which is listed in the stretch goals on the kickstarter page.</notes>

    <notes>I have this and the Exo-Suit Pack, both were purchased on a whim before I realized this would almost certainly never be played in the groups I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like for both of them to go together, because it should be cheaper on the shipping side if I can bundle them.
Thanks!</notes>
