   <description>Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG. This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head. Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;baddie_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; responsible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is basically the Kickstarter version of the game.  I pre-ordered from the Chip Theory Games website.  This includes:
1x Ghillie
1x Tink
1x Nugget
Bonus Promo Treasure card (received from Chip Theory for an incorrect die being shipped to me)
I have all of the expansions fit into the base game box, which will be cheaper to ship, but if you want all of the original boxes, I can definitely include those as well.  Everything is removed from shrink but in new condition.

    <notes>Base game plus Adventurer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Map, upgraded health tokens, character add ons (in shrink): Ghillie, Nugget, and Tink.  Base Game opened and played a couple times.  Tray had some small damage. This game is Big and heavy game so above average cost for shipping.  
I ship from Michigan so west coast is fairly costly.</notes>

    <notes>Played once.   Only opened half the health chips and only half the player mats.
Also, comes with TINK player mat and dice and the Adventure Map accessory.
Liked the game but just TOO MANY BONES and I also like larger tactical maps.     Just bought Hoplo Rise of Rome and hope that scratches my itch.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Played once. Insert is damaged due to the heavy chips moving around during travel/shipping (this is a known issue). Game is in great condition. Will get you the best shipping cost/option I can. Looks like UPS Ground is giving the best cost at around $27-ish to the East Coast, a little over $20 to the Southwest, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing less towards the NW where I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m located (ex: $15-ish to Seattle).

    <notes>I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t actually played the game but it has been opened and I have a good look at all the components. 
The actual game looks great but I just feel that I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do such a heavy game justice. 
Components are amazing and the game looks incredible, but I know I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be playing any time soon so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m hoping to find this gem a new house that will appreciate this game more than I do.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Bone Scouts KS pledge version. Played once.
The game is large and heavy (11.5 lbs according to my original FedEx notice) so shipping will be substantial (USPS from ZIP 20147).  I always carefully package my shipments but be aware that some people complained of broken dice trays, etc., occurring during the original KS shipping. Please contact me by geek mail if you would like an estimate or would like to discuss possible local pickup in the Washington, DC metro area.</notes>

Includes the Premium Health Chips add-on as well, but one chip is missing (64 included instead of 65, still plenty to play the game, original lower quality health chips are not included).  The original containers for the add-on characters are not included but all of their pieces and parts fit in the original game box.  So overall complete except for the one missing health chip.</notes>

- Adventure Map ($15)
- Add-on Character Tink ($25)
- Add-on Character Gillie ($25)
- Add-on Character Nugget ($25)
- Control _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Ur Roll Dice Tray ($15)
- 3x chip organizing trays (3x$5) 
- Promos: (priceless?)
1x Promo 001: The Great Gathering
2x Promo 002: Box of Endless Adventures

So, this all would come out to $254 if you were getting it from the CTG store. 
Everything is in excellent shape, except the bottom tray has a little hole on one side that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve taped over. The insert is fully functional, and the hole is not very noticeable. This is how it arrived, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a common problem with 1st and 2nd Ed inserts (I guess the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;hearty drop test_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; CTG used to test their improvement in the 2nd ed insert wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t much of a test, ha!).

    <notes>This is for second edition of Too Many Bones and all the add-ons I have for it. Game will come with:
-   3 add-on characters: Nugget, Ghillie, and Tink. All 3 still in shrink.
-   Adventure map
-   full set of upgraded health chips
-   2nd edition upgrade pack (received by accident when I got my KS copy of Triplock for some reason; essentially extra copies of a bunch of cards, an extra packing tray, 2 boxes for cards, and a set of player mats)
-   extra dice tray
One of the box chip trays has a crack, came in like that shipped, seems they put some pressure on the sides of some of the boxes and the trays cracked. Seems to be a common problem. Visual defect only, all chips still fit great and snug without any gluing.
Just as a heads up, the whole package is pretty hefty so it might cost a bit to ship. One downside to literally hundreds of dice, I guess!</notes>

Brand new, never opened, never played, sealed.  Shipping is $10.00 (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m eating much of the shipping cost here, the game is quite heavy). If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please.

All expansion boxes have been discarded and all contents fit in the base game box. I have played the game 6 times, but all game components are in like new condition due to the high quality components. The box is in very good condition, some minor creasing and a small ding on one corner that came as a factory preset. There were some component issues which were replaced by CTG, the exception being some color variation among encounter and loot cards - apparently this is very common and CTG declined to replace these cards. The cards are still easily legible, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just slightly different tones.
Nothing is missing - All mats, dice, cards, chips, and tokens are complete.
Buyer pays shipping from 30269 (approx 12 pounds) - max $25 (I will pay any excess over $25).</notes>

Please do not purchase unless you are this User
I have a very good condition copy of:
---Too Many Bones Base Game
---Nugget Character Expansion
All dice, character sheets/mats, cards, chips, etc, are in very good condition. I take care of my games. The rulebook staples did decide to let go of a few pages, which was annoying, but otherwise it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in great shape.
This game has a TON of dice, very cool/fancy chips for enemies/bosses/characters, and a very neat choice system for your adventures and progression of your characters. There is a lot of reading and checking the character sheets for each character on which dice do what, what to upgrade your character with, what different symbols mean, etc. However, it will start making sense after about 1 to 2 games. (I did, however, play this game with 4 characters by myself, so that did multiply the amount of information I had to wrap my head around for all the different abilities, and upgrade path for each character).
This was a really unique experience in playing this game, and I had a lot of fun. Now it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to pass it on to the next gamer for them to enjoy!
Please let me know if you have any questions, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to answer them for you.
For shipping, the price includes FREE SHIPPING in Canada!!! I can include the empty Nugget Character Expansion Box if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like, but all of the items will be stored in the main box.</notes>

3rd Edition
Inadvertently acquired two copies; Willing to sell second at reduced rate in order to recover losses.
Located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Will ship immediately
Considering that you can buy it on Chip Theory’s site for (roughly) $125 plus shipping, the $90 is a good deal. Other sales on this site still have not caught up to the market price based on current availability.
This is my first sale on BGG, but I have successfully traded games in the past.</notes>
