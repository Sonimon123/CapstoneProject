   <description>In the mid-sixteenth century England, Queen Elizabeth I rules without an heir. This leaves room for some maneuvering. Powers throughout, including you, believe that a family with great presence, wealth, and nobility might find itself in the right place at the right time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Noblemen, you are members of the British aristocracy. You will try to achieve influence and prestige for your family. You will grow your family's estate, earn the queen's favor, bear witness to scandalous behavior, gain influence with the church, bribe royalty, and leverage your political weight during masquerade balls, all in an effort to ensure your family's rightful place in history. After three decades, the player with the most victory points will be declared the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a game of several races all going on at the same time. Players race the clock; you will never know exactly how many turns are remaining before the scoring round. Players will race each other _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; to build cheaper buildings, to be the first to build a folly, to have more prestige and therefore gain a higher noble title, and more. On your turn you can play one scandal card (if you choose) in addition to taking one action from the following possibilities:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Grow Estate _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Play lands from behind your screen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Build Structure _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Buy and play a building on a meadow _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Bribe Royalty _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Buy bribe tickets you can redeem later_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Collect Taxes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Get money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Acquire Lands _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Get more land from the bag of random lands_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Donate to the Church _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Redeem lands for victory points_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Leisure Time _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Get one victory point_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On most of your turns, you will build your estate by playing land tiles or building structures. There are three commodities to concentrate on: lands, wealth, and prestige. Each commodity will help on your path to victory. It is for you to decide each turn which is the most needed for you to win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

In the mid-sixteenth century England Queen Elizabeth I rules without an heir. This leaves room for some maneuvering. Powers throughout, including you, believe that a family with great presence, wealth, and nobility might find itself in the right place at the right time. In Noblemen, you are members of the British aristocracy. You will try to achieve influence and prestige for your family. You will grow your family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s estate, earn the queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor, bear witness to scandalous behavior, gain influence with the church, bribe royalty, and leverage your political weight during masquerade balls; all in an effort to ensure your family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s rightful place in history. After three decades, the player with the most victory points will be declared the winner. </notes>

Powers throughout, including you, believe that a family with great presence, wealth, and nobility might find itself in the right place at the right time. In Noblemen, you are members of the British aristocracy. You will try to achieve influence and prestige for your family. You will grow your family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s estate, earn the queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor, bear witness to scandalous behavior, gain influence with the church, bribe royalty, and leverage your political weight during masquerade balls; all in an effort to ensure your family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s rightful place in history. After three decades, the player with the most victory points will be declared the winner. </notes>

    <notes>Tasty Minstrel Games (TTT2002)
In the mid-sixteenth century England Queen Elizabeth I rules without an heir. This leaves room for some maneuvering. Powers throughout, including you, believe that a family with great presence, wealth, and nobility might find itself in the right place at the right time. In Noblemen, you are members of the British aristocracy. You will try to achieve influence and prestige for your family. You will grow your family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s estate, earn the queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor, bear witness to scandalous behavior, gain influence with the church, bribe royalty, and leverage your political weight during masquerade balls; all in an effort to ensure your family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s rightful place in history. After three decades, the player with the most victory points will be declared the winner. </notes>
