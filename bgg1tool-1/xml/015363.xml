   <description>Nexus Ops is a light-medium science fiction war game. The game boasts a hexagonal board that is set up differently every time, as well as (in the Avalon Hill edition) cool _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;glow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; miniatures and lots of combat. Players control competing  futuristic corporations that battle each other for control of the moon's Rubium Ore. By winning battles and fulfilling Secret Missions, you can obtain victory points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units are composed of various alien races and have stats similar to those used in the Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies series. Combat is also similar. Players who lose battles are compensated with Energize cards which grant them special powers later. Players can also obtain Energize cards by controlling the Monolith, a raised structure in the center of the grid. The first person to reach the required number of victory points wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I accept PayPal transfers. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t accept PayPal credit card payments. Buyer pays actual shipping charges for US addresses. International orders will incur a $2 handling fee and shipping insurance is mandatory for international addresses.  I will ship game within 1 business day of receiving payment, unless payment is by personal check.  Personal checks will delay shipping by 7-10 business days after check arrives.  I will combine shipping on multiple orders to lower overall shipping charges.

$12.95 shipping in USA.
I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
I have multiple copies of this and other titles.
Optional insurance $1.35.
Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica, MA, USA.
International orders, please ask about shipping costs before ordering.
PayPal or checks accepted.
Thanks for your order. Your game is ready to ship!

$12.95 shipping in USA.
I combine shipping! So look at my other games for sale. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game.
I have multiple copies of this and other titles.
Optional insurance $1.35.
Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica, MA, USA.
International orders, please ask about shipping costs before ordering.
PayPal or checks accepted.
Thanks for your order. Your game is ready to ship!

    <notes>Game is BRAND NEW SEALED in original shrink wrap. Game was donated to a games library for students and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to use funds for other desired games.
Game is no longer produced and publisher indicates that it will not be re-published.
Shipping calculated based upon where you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re located. Buyer pays actual shipping cost plus $3 packing costs.
Please feel free to email me with any questions. I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sold much on BGG, but all the people I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold to have been 100% satisfied. I can gladly provide references if desired.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

Copies of this out-of-print game used to be readily available; but eventually people caught on to what a cool game it is and the supply became exhausted.  Now, gamers are seeking it out.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and in very good condition.  From a non-smoking home.
You pay all shipping charges. I can ship this item by any carrier you prefer.  Domestic Priority Mail is $15.00.  This method does not include insurance, which can be added for $1.75.  UPS Ground or FedEx ground would also be $15; insurance is included with them. I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged shipments if you do not purchase insurance.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to combine shipping for multiple items. I have quite a few games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling, but it is taking me a while to list them, so e-mail me for a complete list. Use zip code 98104 to calculate shipping costs. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also happy to arrange for local pickup in the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia area.
I will ship anywhere, by your choice of carrier, however there is a $10 surcharge per international shipments above the cost of shipping to compensate me for the additional time involved in shipping internationally. Note that this is per shipment, so if you buy several games from me and have them shipped together, you just pay once. Sorry to have to do this, but international shipments are much more time consuming for me than domestic shipments.
Payment by PayPall only, except for local pickup which must be paid in cash. Sorry, no checks or money orders.  I will ship within 3 days of receipt of payment.</notes>

    <notes>Box has Parkinson written on the box in small letters.
All the pieces are complete and in good condition. The only problem is that the monolith floor had the edges trimmed to fit into the monolith stand. It looks great its just not flush on every other star piece. It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay and you likely wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have noticed it other than me mentioning it. But I just think its important to have full disclosure. Happy to answer any questions.
Buyer pays actual shipping (likely priority flat rate box).</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA80)
Nexus Ops is a board game of fierce sci-fi battles and fantastic alien creatures in which two to four players control factions of corporate troops and strange life forms on an alien moon. Players deploy troops from their home base to explore the landscape, mine resources, purchase troops, win battles, and fulfill missions, all in an attempt to gather enough power to claim the moon for themselves.
 
This new edition of this classic title features detailed plastic figures, stunning new art, a clarified rulebook, and a host of optional rules and variants. Race to the monolith in King of the Hill mode, face the peril of the deadly Vortex, or introduce a full set of alternate unit powers!

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGVA80)
Nexus Ops is a board game of fierce sci-fi battles and fantastic alien creatures in which two to four players control factions of corporate troops and strange life forms on an alien moon. Players deploy troops from their home base to explore the landscape, mine resources, purchase troops, win battles, and fulfill missions, all in an attempt to gather enough power to claim the moon for themselves. This new edition of this classic title features detailed plastic figures, stunning new art, a clarified rulebook, and a host of optional rules and variants. Race to the monolith in King of the Hill mode, face the peril of the deadly Vortex, or introduce a full set of alternate unit powers! </notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Nexus Ops
Description: Nexus Ops board game (Avalon Hill edition) used/complete.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the AH/Hasbro edition of the game (the good one with the glowie troopers and legible board art). This version of the game is rare so my price is a little up for a 2nd hand game.
The game is complete and in good condition. There is a minor rip on the surface of the board front cover. This detracts from the art a little but has no effect on the boxes ability to be a box.
postage for the UK is;
£3.50-4.50 for collectplus
£5.20 for Royal Mail standard parcels
£7+ for 1st class,
a little more if you want signed for and tracked.
Will ship to europe but at a slightly higher cost

    <notes>This is the AH/Hasbro edition.  The game is new and in the original shrinkwrap, but has damage in one corner.  See photo.  This is significant enough that it has split the cardboard, and has caused some creasing of the box around the ding.
Will ship internationally, and US shipping will be $11.50 in a priority box.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill(Hasbro) version in the yellow box. It has been played many times, and the box has moderate shelf wear, but the game is still in great shape. It includes 2 tubes of light purple plastic crystals to use as Rubium counters.  The original box insert has been discarded.  All pieces are sorted and bagged.</notes>

    <notes>This is in very good to excellent condition.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played it a handful of times.  This is the original Avalon hill edition.
Buyer prepays plus USPS priority mail shipping.  If I can find a different box, or you order many games, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to combine shipping or make a special trip to the post office for parcel post, but for just a couple games, or a single game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to use the free boxes for priority mail.  
If we can beat flat rate depending upon your location, we will, but many times flat rate does tend to be the least expensive.  </notes>

    <notes>This is a complete, very good copy of the Avalon Hills edition of Nexus Ops and is from my personal collection--I only got a chance to play this on a single occasion with another adult, so everything is in superb condition. Unfortunately my living/storage situation is about to change and so I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have room for it anymore... my loss is definitely your gain in this instance! For peace of mind, the game comes from a non-smoking, no pet home.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $33 for it and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take of the shipping (via USPS parcel post) anywhere within the continental U.S. Not only will you be getting a great deal on a great game, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be supporting a fellow BGG member in the process (and even making my wife happy that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m thinning the herd!).
Thanks so much for your interest and best wishes for the holidays!</notes>

    <notes>Version - Avalon Hill (Hasbro)
Condition - New in shrink-wrap
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Nexus Ops has been played twice. All miniatures, cards, tokens, dice, and game box are in factory condition. This game has been properly stored in a child-free, pet-free and smoke-free home. I no longer have the time to play unfortunately, so I decided to put the game up for sale. All components are accounted for and are as they were from the factory.
Shipping and handling will cost $9.00 and will be shipped out the following business day after confirmation of payment via paypal. Additionally, a tracking number will be provided once the package has been shipped.
If you have any additional questions feel free to send me a message via BGG. I also offer free pickup if the buyer is located in Rochester, NY.</notes>

    <notes>Version - Avalon Hill (Hasbro)
Condition - New in shrink-wrap
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Selling one copy of the first English language edition of Nexus Ops (from 2005).
The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shrinkwrap has been opened, but the game is unplayed.  The various counters and map tiles have been punched.  Each bag of player pieces has also been opened.  The bag with the cards has been opened.  Only the dice bag is unopened.
All components (cards, counters, tiles, playing pieces) have been accounted for.
The outside game box is in pretty much near mint condition.  There are slight indentations here and there, but overall in great shape after all of these years.
This game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

All game components in superb condition. Only played twice. Box lid has a two inch vertical crack on the corner which is completely superficial and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even go through to the other side of the lid. May have just been a manufacturing defect of the lid. Completely irrelevant really.</notes>

    <notes>My copy of Nexus Ops was opened and played two times. Please geek mail me if you would like photos or have questions about the game.
Buyer will pay shipping and packaging costs (not my time, but the box and bubble wrap). If you have a shipping preference, geek mail me and let me know.
Also, I live in the 21209 zip code (Baltimore, MD), so let me know if you would prefer to pickup the game and save us both time on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Box is in good shape, but is very thin cardboard.  Missing one creature (was missing when I bought it).  I never missed it in the few plays I played.  May be able to find one on BGG.  Inquire if interested and I will verify the exact missing piece.
This is the Avalon Hill version with the cool pieces that glow under a black light.
Buyer pays shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Played once , it just never clicked with my wife.
I ship out of Iowa (52402) so everything in the USA is fairly centralized. If you have any preference for shipping just let me know. I also have a postal scale so we can weigh anything you want to get an accurate price for your shipping costs.
All items I sell come from a smoke free home and I keep my games in a humidity/temperature controlled room.</notes>
