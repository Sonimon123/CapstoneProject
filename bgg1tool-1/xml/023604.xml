   <description>The World Cup Game is a football (soccer) game that is like no other soccer game. This is the first of its kind that closely resembles the current genre of German-style boardgames that have become so popular in recent years. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It is not a quiz game and it is not a single match style soccer game, but it covers two complete tournaments - the 1930 tournament in Uruguay and the 2002 tournament in Korea and Japan. Two games in one box. The 1930 game takes around an hour to play, while the 2002 game takes around 3 hours to play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The box is weighty, coming in at just under 2kg, so you get a lot for your money. The components are 2 large boards, 74 National flag tiles, 182 Action tiles, 87 Action cards, 36 Plastic footballs, 4 'blob'dice, 3 score sheets, a rulebook and the box!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The World Cup Game - Expansion 1 (contains World Cups of 1958, 1962 and 1966, and a sheet of all flags needed for the expansions)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The World Cup Game - Expansion 2 (contains World Cups of 1934, 1938 and 2006)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The World Cup Game - Expansion 3 (contains World Cups of 1950, 1986 and 1990 and Euro 2008)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The World Cup Game - Expansion 4 (contains World Cups of 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1994)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The World Cup Game - Expansion 5 (contains World Cups of 1954, 1970 and 1998)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The World Cup Game - Expansion 6 (Contains World Cup of 2010 and the new expansion card set)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Cardgame version:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The World Cup Card Game 2010_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hi guys, new copy of the World Cup Game with expansions #1, #2, and #3! All components complete and in pristine condition as if the shrink just came off with the exception of the colored soccer balls; they are not included in the game and are not necessary for playing the game.  I needed room to include the 3 expansions in the main game box.  The cards for the game are even sleeved!  I want someone else to enjoy it since its collecting dust in my house, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this rare copy with the first 3 expansions for only $75! hope you fun with this game!

There is some damage to the top lid of the box just above the refs head. It is about the size of a 5 pence piece and extends to a small tear of about 15 mm down the back of the lid. The strength of the box lid has not been impaired by the damage.The rest of the box top and the contents are in very good condition. I have taken account of this minor damage in the very kean price.</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is a used copy of The World Cup Game. Game components are in excellent condition. I was missing one flag, but received a sheet of replacements from the publisher so there are extra/spare pieces (the flag was one of many pieces on the sheet).
The only official component missing is the 1930 double sided score sheet. I printed out a copy of the score sheet that can be found in the files section here on BGG and have included it with the game.
Box has minor wear. Please see the attached picture.
Price is $100 + $11.35 USPS Priority Mail shipping for a total of $111.35. I accept Paypal and will ship anywhere in the U.S.
I only have 2 Marketplace ratings, but I also have 13 trade ratings and I am very careful when I package my games for shipping.
On a case by case basis, I will consider international buyers. Please geekmail me first.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: The World Cup Game with Expansions 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2
Description: The World Cup Game with expansions 1 and 2. Game has never been played so aside from the box being opened so that I could keep the two unplayed expansions inside it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pristine.
Shipping Weight:  6 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and in excellent condition (unplayed) and from a smoke and pet-free home.
Includes expansions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 (so everything but exp 4). I think the expansions came in zip-loc_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s however they are now just collated into the main box.
Selling reluctantly as I would love to have given this a go but just never seem to have the right group or opportunity. 
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy so international shipping will be silly expensive - especially with insurance.</notes>

    <notes>Price includes base game and expansion 1, which is Sweden 1958, Chile 1962 and England 1966.
The base game has some wear to edges and corners where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been in cupboard.
The expansion is still in shrink wrap brand new.
Great game, selling to make space
Will ship to Europe, buyer to pay for shipping</notes>
