   <description>This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game where the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power. The game is played on a number of boards: the Master board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits, and a number of scenario boards which detail the events and adventures of particular locations. Progression across the boards is determined by playing cards (many of which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth), and the effects of corruption are represented by a special die. The game is lost if the ring-bearer is overcome by Sauron, or won if the ring is destroyed by throwing it into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lord of the Rings - Limited Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001.

    <notes>The game is in complete condition, but there are a few flaws with the components. The Moria board looks as if it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wrapped correctly, so the paper on the left side of the board is crinkled on the edges. Also, when I received the game, something punctured a hole in the box on the back. I have it taped up so it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t snag anything. Therefor, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game for a cheaper price.
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is $7.50</notes>

The games have been opened but unplayed.  Unpunched, cards still sealed for both expansions, truly about as close to New as you can get.  I really need to make room, and thought it would be easiest to sell them all at once.  These are English editions.</notes>

Lord of the Rings from Fantasy Flight Games - English Edition.  ALSO INCLUDED in the box:  THE SARON EXPANSION  and a custom-made rulebook that incorportates all the rules from all of the expansions - with color coded rules - LoRT in black, the Saron Expansion rules in Red and the Friends and Foe expansion in blue.  The integrated rulebook is home made using a scanner, color printer and computer and is fully illustrated.  This is a one-of a kind item and is included with the Game.  The Friends and Foe Expansion module is not included.  Also included: several copies of the 1-page fully illustrated graphic rules summary.  Game has been played about 4 times.</notes>

    <notes>Box in good condition, components in Like new condition. The box has some damage to the lid, with scuffing and shredding of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;art cover_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; along one corner and one edge. The box has not been structurally damaged however. Game appears to be unplayed.
I also have for $22.00 another one. Description follows:
Game appears to be unplayed. A little shelf scuff on the box. One of the event tile_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s back is torn, but I think a draw bag would render this a non-issue. The box also has a garage sale price written on it in permanent marker.
If you want to buy this copy, make an offer of $22, and I will know that this is the one you want. Or contact me prior to the purchase.</notes>

    <notes>A player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s set available here: Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Lord of the Rings, plus a brand new edition of Friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Foes which has never been used, though the shrink has been broken on the cards. The base game comes with 4 professionally painted Hobbits from the LotR table top game (see picture) which alone retail for 20$, without the paint. The fifth plastic hobbit from the original game is still included as well.
Game components have some wear, but this game was barely used so it is still in good shape. The boxes on both titles have some minor edge wear, F_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;F has a bit of crushing as that was the way it was in the store when I purchased it.
Shipping is completely up to you as regards speed and other options, I will only charge you true cost and ship the same day I receive payment from you, fast turnaround is my specialty.</notes>

    <notes>Lord of the Rings by Reiner Knizia, published by Hasbro.
Like New condition - the pieces have been punched out.  Other than that - looks brand new.  Gorgeous game - beautiful art.
Would like to sell locally (cash), but will ship if buyer pays actual cost of preferred shipping method (+$5 handling).  Paypal or Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Check if shipped.
Will consider trades as well.
Thanks,

Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Selling Lord of the Rings plus two expansions:  Sauron and Friends and Foes.  Lord of the Rings base set is complete, no broken pieces.  Components very good, box had a tear on inner box which was taped up.  Sauron was punched but never played.  Friends and Foes played once only.  Great game, but my friends weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the biggest fans.  Includes custom artscow cards to replace tiles.  I combine shipping, local pickup possible.</notes>

    <notes>Quite worn, but the box lid is intact.  The bottom box is starting to split on one corner, but still intact (just!). The rules are well worn (why does anyone need the rules so much?) and coming apart at the staples.  No tears or rips - just wear.  The remaining contents are all complete and in very good condition - even the cards are still in great shape.
Game is in excellent condition.  All the components are present and correct.

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple auctions. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Lord of the Rings (2000) from Fantasy Flight
Box:  Moderate overall shelfwear with much heavier wear along the edges.  Box also has several significant dings, dents, and gouges, with box bottom looking like it lost an argument with a badger.  Overall the box is in fair condition.
Components:  Complete and in good or better condition!  The red hobbit was broken but has been mended and seems to be fine now.  Remaining components show light wear but nothing that should interfere with gameplay.  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged. 
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. from zip code 85208. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.

    <notes>Like new never played with. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only selling this, as I won it in a bulk buy on ebay and it is my second copy. If you can, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d prefer to swap it for the Battlefields or Friends or Foe Expansions or make me an offer for another game as its just sat on my shelf at the moment.

    <notes>The box has some regular shelf wear and a slight tear in the outer wrapper, but inside, this game is complete, intact and in great shape.  If you can get past expected cosmetic wear over the years to the box, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find a great deal to be had.
Take note!  I am selling this game ONLY with the expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Friends and Foes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as it required adhering stickers to the core game board for the new missions of traveling to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Bree_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Isengard._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 
Friends as Foes is in newer shape, described as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition and selling for $22.
I think you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find the two of them together will be quite a deal if this is your first foray into this unique cooperative game.  
I had a lot of fun playing this with friends and look forward to passing this game system on to a new gaming group to love!
Note, if you buy two or more games from me (including this game and the F_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;F expansion), i will deduct $5 off your total shipping. so this makes it even more of a great deal! it will end up being $29 for both (22 + 12 - 5= $29) plus shipping.</notes>

    <notes>***PLEASE NOTE -- THIS EDITION IS A GERMAN EDITION***
Out of shrink-wrap but never played -- nothing even punched -- original 1st edition from Germany, in German. Of course, the components are mostly language neutral, so playable for English speakers but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to use an English rules translation and for a few cards (Gandalf, etc.) have those translated.
This game makes a great gift for the native (or aspirational) German speaker in your life! A wonderful and beautiful game, one of Reiner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best.
Shipping will be $11, so you can add that to the price.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGLTR12)
Travel the perilous path to Mordor in Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s The Lord of the Rings. Beautifully illustrated by renown Tolkien artist John Howe, this uniquely cooperative board game immerses 2-5 players into Middle-earth, taking on the roles of hobbits on a quest to destroy the One Ring. This new Silver Line Edition of The Lord of the Rings features a beautiful graphics overhaul, a new rules presentation, and updated components, all bundled into a smaller, more affordable package. The time has never been better to experience The Lord of the Rings! Because many of the components have changed in size and design (making the game much more compact) this new edition will be incompatible with previously released expansions.</notes>

    <notes>This is for my copy of Lord of the Rings, as well as the expansions Friends and Foes, Sauron, and The Black Gate.  This is one of the grand-daddies of the co-op genre, and is a rich thematic experience that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to the table enough to justify keeping.  
The box has a little wear, but the components are in great shape.  Black Gate is a print and play version released by the publisher.  The main board has additions to it from Friends and Foes (extra stops on the path) as well as my hand-written notes on what to do.</notes>

This is the original edition that comes with black Sauron monolith like [geekurl=/image/77073/lord-rings]this[/geekurl], ring like [geekurl=/image/1655319/lord-rings]this[/geekurl], plastic hobbit minis like in the ring picture (and not the cardboard versions that come in the Silverline edition).  
There is only 1 of the extra blank cards; bgg inventory list says there are 5, but i don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think i ever had 5.  They extra blank cards have no purpose in the game.

    <notes>Selling base game + Friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Foes expansion
[FantasyFlight Games 1st Edition 2001]
Both games are sold together because the stickers from the expansion are applied to the base game and cannot be removed.  Base game and expansion is complete and in very good condition.  However, the set of cards from the expansion are marked on one side due to wearing of elastic band. Does not affect game play and not visible if sleeved.  
Pictures available on request. Please send message if you have any questions.

This would be guides and player aids and some wooden/plastic bits _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; pieces, here and there (to enhance the theme).

    <notes>Played only a very few times. Basically, the game lives very calmly on my shelf. Need some space on my shelf for new games to come.
Red player figure is damaged (compare picture, can be glued).
Please ask for shipping costs.
Payment via bank transfer preferred. For PayPal please add Paypal fees to the total price.
ESSEN PICK UP AVAILABLE! I can bring the game to Essen Spiel 2017, too. Will be there from Thursday to Saturday. A reservation fee of 5 € is fair, I suppose. Of course, the fee will be subtracted from the game price when handed over.</notes>

    <notes>The base game is complete and is in its own box.  This bundle also includes: Sauron (Like new, unpunched), Friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Foes (very good), and Battlefields (New).  Also contains the Black Gate Promo card set.  Because all the games in this bundle include their boxes, this bundle will be more expensive to ship than normal.</notes>

    <notes>Game collection.  Base game plus expansions, Sauron and Friends and Foes (expansion are included in the base box - no expansion boxes).  Game contents are in like new condition with the exception of the green hobbit figure (which snapped from its base - pieces are included, can likely be glued together).  Gold ring is included for the base game.  From a smoke free home.  I believe this is the Hasbro UK second edition - it is Hasbro and the front has the orange diamond on the cover.  Buyer to pay shipping and pay pal fee.</notes>
