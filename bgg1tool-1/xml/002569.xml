   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;A corn, please!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is the cry heard from many fowl mouths at the cold buffets in the many poultry yards. Game hens, pheasants, ducks, geese, and turkeys seem to be always hungry - never getting enough to eat. In Pick Picknic, a real feast awaits them! The fox is also always hungry and ready to eat, but from a somewhat different menu,... Chickens, geese, and ducks, become happily plump when they are able to eat well and often. Such is not different for the clever fox, who will eat all manner of incautious fowl... At the end of the game, the player who has gotten the plumpest poultry and the most nutritious corn is the winner!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Stefan Dorra's remake of Razzia with the theme centered around chickens and their quest for corn.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 216)
Number of players: 2-6
Age of players: 8+
Length: 20 minutes
Game Description: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;A corn, please!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is the cry heard from many fowl mouths at the cold buffets in the many poultry yards. Game hens, pheasants, ducks, geese, and turkeys seem to be always hungry - never getting enough to eat. In Pick Picknic, a real feast awaits them! The fox is also always hungry and ready to eat, but from a somewhat different menu,... Chickens, geese, and ducks, become happily plump when they are able to eat well and often. Such is not different for the clever fox, who will eat all manner of incautious fowl... At the end of the game, the player who has gotten the plumpest poultry and the most nutricious corn is the winner!

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

Local pickup available near Montreal (Longueuil).
I also visit these cities in Quebec so we can agree for a meetup there : Chambly, Montreal, Beloeil, Saint-Hyacinthe, Saint-Hubert. 
Shipping time within Canada and the US
Expect 2 to 7 days, depending on distance from Montreal, QC. If you are on the West Coast, expect about 7 days for the package to reach you.
Shipping within Canada
There is only one parcel category, and cost varies between $12 and $20 for 1 game, depending on area and weight. Add $3 to $5 for each additional game.
Shipping to the US
When shipping to the US from Canada, there are three parcel categories, those being small, medium and large. The cost is based on overall area (Length x Width x Height), which is then multiplied by weight. The Canada Post calculator can be found here:
http://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/far/personal/farUS?ex...
Shipping examples:
Shipping a single game costs between $16 (Medici vs Strozzi) and $25 (standard FFG box size) for the first game, then add $3-5 dollars per game, depending on size _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; weight.</notes>

    <notes>This is the German edition of Pick Picknic. The German instructions are NOT included, rather a color copy of the English rules are included (they have been cut to size in order to fit inside the box). The game is in good condition and has been verified as complete. The cards show a little wear from being handled but none have any rips or damage to them. Box does show moderate wear and has a few corners which have been taped up but overall the box is fine and serves its purpose. Cardboard insert is also present</notes>
