   <description>Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege,18-27 Dec '44,  is the thirteenth game is the Standard Combat Series.  This game covers the defense of the little crossroads town of Bastogne from 18 December to 26 December 1944. It is not a game about the whole Ardennes Offensive, but rather a close-up look at the actual perimeter battle to protect the town and the mechanized delaying actions leading into it. The map only extends as far east as Longvilly and north to Noville at 400m per hex. Each turn is a day, units are generally companies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bastogne comes with special rules for road marching, Team SNAFU, barrages, and air strikes - but is built around a quick-to-play, simple-to-learn framework. Bastogne has three scenarios: an introductory scenario covering the Battle for Noville, a medium-sized one covering the Battle for Longvilly, and the withdrawal of Team Cherry plus the counterattack by the 501st Airborne Regiment, and the campaign game itself covering the whole action in a jam-packed 10 turns. A number of variants have been provided so you can experience the game over and over looking at fresh insights._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Scale:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Turn: One day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hex: 400 meters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Units: Platoon to Battalion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: 4+ hours_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity: Low_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Solitaire Suitability: High_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Multi-Man Publishing (MUM SCS513)
December 1944 The first thing you notice are soldiers. Parts of commands stationed to the east. Exhausted, some frightened, men who can give you little information on what is coming but they all agree it is coming fast. The German offensive started two days ago. Your men have been dispatched in three Task Forces to meet the offensive head-on.
Late at night, after your lead armor begins to engage the probing Germans, an elite and rested airborne division is screaming into your rear area aboard trucks from some town deep in France. The 101st Airborne Division. Hastily equipped, barely supplied. You will be placing the village of Bastogne into the history books.
Bastogne is a game covering the defense of the little crossroads town of Bastogne from 18 December to 26 December 1944. It is not a game about the whole Ardennes Offensive, but rather a close-up look at the actual perimeter battle to protect the town and the mechanized delaying actions leading into it. The map only extends as far east as Longvilly and north to Noville at 400m per hex. Each turn is a day, units are generally companies.
Bastogne comes with special rules for road marching, Team SNAFU, barrages, and air strikes - but is built around a quick-to-play, simple-to-learn framework. Bastogne has three scenarios: an introductory scenario covering the Battle for Noville, a medium-sized one covering the Battle for Longvilly, and the withdrawal of Team Cherry plus the counterattack by the 501st Airborne Regiment, and the campaign game itself covering the whole action in a jam-packed 10 turns. A number of variants have been provided so you can experience the game over and over looking at fresh insights.</notes>

    <notes>All games are complete to the best of my knowledge, if I have any doubt I sell it as pieces.
I am a non-smoker.  The games have been stored in a dry basement in bookshelves. 
I wrap all the games I sell in plastic to prevent damaged. The game come with trays in them, if they came with them or I if added them.
I also professional mailing company’s. They do a good job in packing and insurance. Never had a problem with either them.   Due to some non-payment of items sent, I will only now take PayPal and will have the postage and the game amount paid in full before I send the game.  I thought I could trust the buyers, put sadly I was proven wrong.
 PayPal is game1953@att.net
