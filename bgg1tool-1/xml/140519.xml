   <description>Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Myth Captain level pledge, including stretch goals.  This level does NOT include the 1 per backer stretch goals which I believe are just the Twilight Knight and Trickster.
This does include the following:
-Base game
-Razor Fiend Mini boss
-Expansion set 1 (10 Skeleton Minions, 2 Skeleton Captains)
-Kickstarter exclusive Rat Mini Boss
-2 extra Orc Captains, 2 extra Skeleton Captains, 2 extra Arachnid Captains
-6 arachnids, 6 orcs, 6 skeletons
-Hero deck card sleeves with hero artwork for each base game class
-Alternate gender heroe miniatures for base game
-Expansion set 2 (10 elemental minions, and 2 captains)
-Skeleton boss huge miniature with 10 card deck
-1 of each sculpted lairs and traps
-Large Orc Boss miniature with 10 card deck
-Set of 10 new world tiles
-Expansion set 3 (10 rat minions, 2 rat captains)
-Extra 6 skeleton minions, 6 rats, and 6 elementals
-Enormous Rat boss miniature with 10 card deck
-2 extra Rat captains, 2 extra elemental captains
-Expansion set 4 (10 cyclops minions, 2 cyclops captains)
-Minotaur Mini Boss miniature
-Kickstarter exclusive Metal hero tokens and coins
-Kickstarter exclusive Connor Miniature Mini-Boss and Connor Quest deck
-15 Kickstarter exclusive additional story quests (this was upped from the original number of 10
-Slaughterfield tile set (5 tiles)
-Kickstarter exclusive Torchbearer follower
-Cyclops boss miniature with 10 card deck
-Marcus the ready ally miniature
-Fire drake miniature with 10 card boss deck
It is my understanding that the Trickster and the Twilight Knight are the only two 1 per backer stretch goals which are not included.  I looked back over the Kickstarter and that seems to be the case.
I have previously sold my Sedition Wars pledge level months before the product actually shipped.  That went very smoothly and I can provide the user as a reference (it was sold via bartertown.com forums).
Shipping for all of this will be $20.  If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s split into multiple shipments (if, for instance, some of the stretch goals hit a snag and are delayed), no additional shipping will be added and I will cover the cost.</notes>

    <notes>This is a Captain-level Kickstarter pledge for the Myth board game with all the stretch goals plus a couple of extra add-ons. The wave 1 shipment is in hand and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship it to you immediately. This includes:
* The base game
* Hero deck card sleeves (including Spriggan and Skald)
* Kickstarter-exclusive story quests
* Metal hero tokens
* Metal treasure tokens
* Metal Torchbearer figure
When the second wave ships from MERCS (probably late April/May), you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive all the remaining Captain-level pledge items (including the Twilight Knight), plus these add-ons I purchased:
* Skald hero figures + deck
* Spriggan hero figure + deck
In terms of game condition: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened the game, punched and bagged the components, sleeved the hero deck cards, read the rulebook several times, and played it twice. There is no appreciable wear and tear. (I think this qualifies as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but given the couple of plays I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to be on the safe side.)
Buyer pays actual shipping for the base game from 99338. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll update the pledge manager to have the second wave sent directly to you (or, if that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t work, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover the shipping costs for it).</notes>

    <notes>This is a Captain level Kickstarter with all promos and extras ($100), plus $180 worth of add-ons.   So I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking only for what I put into it, despite KS exclusives or whatever.  The add-ons include all the characters, their decks, and card sleeves, plus all enemies, treasure cards, slaughterfield deck, etc. -- EVERYTHING related to gameplay elements, not bling.  I will send all the Wave 1 that I have now, and send you all the Wave 2 as soon as it comes, unopened.
All excellent condition, non-smoking home, only played twice (while sleeved).  I take fastidious care of my games.
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a brilliant game in here, the card mechanic is super cool; however, I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to devote to it.
The box is large and heavy, but I will do my best to find the least expensive method of shipping for you, if you wish.  If overseas and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like a quote, please send $5 first.  Sorry, but I have too many overseas requests for quotes that then don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t purchase games, and has become no longer worth my time without this.</notes>

- 17 Counters 
In addition to the base game, you will receive the following items:

    <notes>Are you one of the unwashed masses lamenting your misfortune at having missed the kickstarter for one of the most polarizing games in recent boardgamegeek history?  Do you gnash your teeth and grip your computer keyboard in impotence and rage, knowing you can’t contribute in any meaningful way to the irate threads raging across this game’s page?  Would you jump at the chance to pay a reasonable price for a kickstarter pledge, and avoid those online scalpers and their outrageous price hikes?  Well, my friend. Have I got an offer for you.  
I’m selling my captain’s pledge with lots of add on goodies for $300, I’ll pay shipping (or the first 40-50 bucks worth of shipping, including insurance for $250.  If you want it fast, you’ll be responsible for the difference).  The game is like new (opened, everything punched, those cards with sleeves are sleeved, played 2-3 times) and all the wave 2 stuff is brand new (nothing is punched, opened or overly messed with, but everything was as inventoried as possible without breaking the cellophane.  Please read the full list below, however.) 
This was a ridiculously successful KS, and it came with an absurd amount of goodies.  I can’t keep it all straight in my head, and if you’re new to the party, I’d be impressed if you could sort it all out.  Here’s a nice graphic of what the Captain’s pledge includes (http://keithloweart.com/pledge_level_tally_04.12.jpg).  This purchase also includes a bunch of add ons, all noted below.  The price I’m asking for covers the cost of my pledge plus lots of add ons, plus BGG’s commission, plus whatever the heck shipping and insurance will be (i.e., I’m not making money here, but after all I’ve suffered with this game, I’m not up for losing much money either…).  And, as a tithe to my toddler son, he has demanded that we keep 3 orcs, 4 skeletons, and one arachnid captain (the giant scorpion figure).  These were the figures you get too many of in the Captain’s pledge anyway, so this won’t affect gameplay in any significant way.  
Here’s what you get (add ons are noted below for your viewing pleasure and to facilitate your bragging about them to your friends post haste):
- Complete retail version of the game.  Includes card sleeves for all the heroes.
- Nearly complete Captain pledge (see notes about the tithe my son imposed.  This won’t affect normal gameplay as we got a silly amount of figures in the Captain pledge)
- Cool but mostly useless kickstarter metal tags for each of your heroes.  Nifty, but hard to read.
- Cool and totally rad kickstarter metal treasure tokens.  Be the envy of your gaming buddies!
- 10 new boardgame tiles
- 10 kickstarter exclusive story quests 
- 5 Slaughterfield Tiles and the slaughterfield deck of cards to play this mode of the game.
- 1 Counter sheet (Title tokens, Elder Spriggan tokens, etc. - this is the unpunched sheet that’ll you’ll find in the game box)
- Overview _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Walkthrough black and white booklet.  The !@#*! thing they forgot to add the first time around that largely led to the storm of controversy over this game!
- Quest Deck 1 (I think this was some extra thing they threw in our box.  Not quite sure of its provenance, importance, pedigree, or relevance.  But you can have it)
- The Skald Hero (two figures, cards, sleeves), which I picked up as an add on
- The Spriggan Hero (one figure, cards, sleeves), which I picked up as an add on
- The Treasure expansion (cards), which I picked up as an add on
- The Quest expansion (cards), which I picked up as an add on
- The Elemental Boss (one big figure, cards), which I picked up as an add on
- The evil Agents (3 figures, cards), which I picked up as an add on
- Tuck boxes for all your hero cards (yes, they fit the sleeved cards, you’re welcome) printed out and assembled from the files posted by a hard working community member here at the ‘geek.  Totally rad?  Yes, yes they are.  (even if perhaps not as professional as if MegaCon had done ‘em, but hey.  You get what you pay for, right?)
- A bunch of other print outs: FAQs, hints on how to play the base game dudes, some other random stuff that you may or may not find helpful
An obscene amount of minis, detailed below
- There’s probably stuff I’m forgetting.  But maybe not?  You’ll find out soon, right?
Here’s an annotated inventory of all the figures you get in this game.  Unless noted below, these are all Captains pledge or add on figures.  Those that use them, include their respective decks.  They look like they’re all there too (but I just counted the decks and did not open/unwrap them).  Can you just see how apoplectic with hysterical joy you will be upon opening this box?  Can you?
Bosses
1 Crawler Boss + cards (from the base game)
1 Orc Boss + cards
1 Rat Boss + cards
1 Cyclops Boss + cards
1 Fire Drake + cards
1 Skeleton Boss + cards (OK, gird your loins. This guy looks like he bent or broke in transit. You’ll need to get out your hobby glue and give this guy some serious attention.  I can’t quite tell what’s going on in the baggie, but this was not a terribly well designed mini and you’ll need to be prepared to fix him)
1 Elemental boss + cards (add on!)
Mini-Bosses (each with stat card)
Yardu the undead giant mini boss (from the base game)
Twilight Knight mini boss + Orange Item card, this is a KS limited edition thing.  You will be much cooler than you are now when you own this.
Big rat thing with a goblin on top Mini-Boss.  Another KS exclusive?  You bet!
Minotaur Mini-Boss
Conner Mini Boss (Dog) + Conner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Toy quest card.  Helloooo another KS exclusive!  Hot damn!
Razorfiend mini boss.  This is another KS exclusive/promo thing.  Again, your self worth will balloon once this arrives on your doorstep
Donnchadh (3 musketeer looking guy) + character deck card
Those three dastardly agent figures! (add on! With cards!)
Minions/Captains 
18 Skeleton Minions (Compliments of my son’s tithe)
4 Skeleton Captains
4 Orc Captains (some from the base game, some from kickstarter)
3 Arachnid Captains (Compliments of my son’s tithe; some from base game, some from kickstarter)
20 Arachnids (some from the base game, some from kickstarter)
17 Orcs (Compliments of my son’s tithe; some from the base game, some from kickstarter)
16 Elemental Minions
2 Elemental Captains
16 Rat Minions
2 Rat Captains
10 Cyclops Minions
2 Cyclops Captains
Heroes/Allies.  All heroes come with their cards and sleeves.
10 Hero figures (base set, male and female figures.  Some from the base game, some from kickstarter)
2 Trickster Heroes (male and female) along with their deck, and 6 plastic traps they can play.  Another KS exclusive?  Yes.  Will your awesomeness know no bounds?  It shall indeed. 
1 Marcus the Ready ally
1 Torchbearer ally (metal)
2 Skald Heroes (male and female; they’re bards), another hero class that you’ll get because you so need it and there’s no way there’s enough playability in the base captains pledge!  (add on!)
The weird metal spriggan hero (add on) that is another exclusive model, and will certainly increase your appeal to those to whom you want your appeal increased*.

Everything has been painstakingly inventoried. Everything is included, except for the $425k reward (Elemental Bosses x 2 and Rat Bosses x2) and the $125k and $375k skeletons x6, all of which was delayed. As Megacon Games mentioned in Update #131, they had a shortage of these items when they sent Wave 2. To be clear, I do have 2 of each boss and 20 skeletons already in hand,  Honestly, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d probably never miss them if I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t inventory everything. When I receive these, they will be forwarded to you. 
Buyer will pay shipping. GM me with zip code for a quote.
International: GM me before purchasing to be sure I can ship to your country and for a shipping quote.

    <notes>I bought this in new condition with the 41 minis professionally painted - they are amazing.  For shipping, I will wrap each mini in bubblewrap.  There is a 10-page color printout of the Overview and Walkthrough, a 1-page color Starting Quest and 9-page color Official Errata and FAQ.  The cards and tiles are bagged.  The cardboard counters and chits are separated in a plastic container with individual compartments - this fits nicely in the box.  The only thing that I did not think of is a way to get my husband to play this game with me.  I think it looks great - he refuses to play it, so unfortunately the game has never been played.  Comes from a smoke-free home.
     If you send me an email address, I can send pics of the painted minis.</notes>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a BIG, heavy box, so I expect shipping to be around $30.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get you a quote and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only pay actual shipping.
Please PM me with any questions.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This is a full captain level pledge from the Myth kickstarter including all stretch goals, addons, and Kickstarter exclusives.  This was my personal copy to play that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want anymore.  Everything is in top notch condition.  I also paid to print ALL materials from the update patches via Printer Studio.  This means you will have current, updated cards for all heroes, new monsters, and new quests as well as a deck of trap cards.  This is everything you could ever want from the first Kickstarter and gets you all ready for the second. 
I accept Chase Bank transfer or Paypal.  Please contact me so I can calculate shipping, this is a heavy product with lots of stuff.  I am willing to ship out of country but be warned - it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going to probably be expensive.</notes>

    <notes>For RustyRooster 200.00 plus shipping and PayPal. Captain Level Kick Starter Edition, with Skald add on and all stretch goals.  Reason for Very Good is that the box has been opened and most Miniatures are on bases.  The box also has a ding in the corner and split corner(not all the way and does not effect integrity of the box).  Game has been inventoried and is 101 percent complete even has some extra minis.  This is a big heavy box I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d estimate 12 or so pounds so shipping will not be cheap.  Local Pick up is an option as well.</notes>

    <notes>Captain level Kickstarter. Includes 144 minis rather than the base game amount of 44. Unplayed by me, simply stored. Played once by previous owner. In addition to the many extra minis there are extra map tiles, extra scenarios and extra items. Extra female characters, and pre printed card sleeves (plus many spares for when they split).
I will not split this bundle up, so please do not ask. All or nothing!!
I am selling off more than half of my collection over the next few weeks. If you are interested in something ask. I might just sell it.
Will ship to UK only.
Shipping via Myhermes direct to your door including tracking, £8. I would happily allow collection by any purchaser for this and even offer a small discount for saving my time and energy.
Payment via paypal. 
Will combine shipping with other items for lower cost where possible.</notes>

    <notes>Myth Journeyman 400$ Minon Level Pledge
Seller will email username and password to the pledge manager for Myth Journeyman when it opens (as soon as possible, but no later than a week from the pledge manager opens).
The pledge is a Myth Journeyman 400$ Minion level pledge, leaving 280$ for add-ons chosen by the buyer.
Keep in mind that it is a Kickstarter pledge. Therefore the buyer of the pledge takes on the risk of pledging such project. Seller can in no way guarantee the fulfillment of the product of the pledge, only that login is provided to the pledge manager with a Myth Jorneyman 400$ Minion level pledge.
Please be aware that once bought, refund of the pledge will not be issued for ANY reasons (see risk above)!</notes>

    <notes>This is one copy of the Myth kickstarter (captain level) that has been unpacked and put into the myth battlefoam cut out, a plastic miniatures case, and all cards are sleeved in myth sleeves in a card box. Some figures not assembled yet, Spriggan, clear rat rogue, torch bearer. Includes Twilight Knight mini boss.  
This set has been opened but never used. I have sorted out all miniatures and cards and verified that they are all here. This includes all 5 heroes with alternate genders, (And the clear hidden rat rogue). In addition to those five base heroes this also has the Trickster, Spriggan, and Skald as well as all alternate versions of each Hero (Except Spriggan, none was ever made). Along with all kickstarter free upgrades. 
This also comes with additional products including the battle foam cut out for the base set, all sleeves for all cards, a box for the miniatures, additional dice, the treasure bag, the hidden rat rouge figure, and expansion tiles one. Includes excess sleeves, and all boxes shown in the pictures.
All items are accounted for from the kickstarter, in fact I had to request missing items originally, two of the metal hero tokens were missing. And Mercs has released its rules 2.0 completely revised and is avaliable online for FREE.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for a copy of the Myth core game updated with 2.0 rules and cards as well as taking over my pledge for the Myth Journeyman Kickstarter.  I received the 2.0 updates already as part of the KS and have those with the core box, but the rest of the Journeyman pledge has not yet shipped.  If you purchase this, I will update the pledgemanager with your shipping info so that the rest of the items will ship directly to you when they release.  Please contact me by Geekmail with any questions and to discuss further how we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll transfer the pledgemanager.
Upon receipt of your paypal I will immediately ship the Myth core box w/ 2.0 updates so you can start playing right away!  The asking price of $650 INCLUDES shipping to anywhere in the US.  My total Journeyman pledge was for $645.  And that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include the core box which sells new for $75 (or actually closer to $50 from discount online resellers).  Even at $50 for the core box thats a total of about $700 for all of this.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering a discount for the whole thing at $650 (basically giving you the core box for free and you get to take over my pledge and receive all Journeyman content brand new directly to you) in the hopes of selling this quickly as I simply overspent last year and would like to reclaim some of that money.
Included in the journeyman pledge :
Minion Level Pledge $120
Myth 2.0 printed materials (already received and included in core box)
Shores of Kanis
Blackwall Warrens
KS Exclusive Avatar of Shadow figure
All In Modules $130
Over The Top $300  
Undead $50
Item Expansion 2  $10

    <notes>Mercs (MCX5901)
Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck. Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all. No player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game. Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.</notes>

    <notes>Captain Level Myth Kickstarter w/ all stretch goals, plus:
 - Skald Hero Add-on
 - Skald Hero card sleeves Add-on
 - Elemental Boss Add-on
 - Treasure Deck Expansion Add-on
 - Quest Expansion 1 Add-on
 - 6x6 Tile Supplement Add-on
All components have been very well cared for and are good as new.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m obsessive about keeping my games in great condition.  All cards are sleeved with premium card sleeves.  I worked hard to find storage boxes, card boxes, etc so that everything would fit well in the original box.  I will include all these storage units along with the game, as well as the laminated quick reference sheets I printed off.  If you want to email me, I can show you some pictures of all the components set out on a table.  With the exception of the miniatures themselves, everything fits snug in the original game box.  
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little bit of wear on the front of the rulebook, but you will want to download the updated rules PDF anyway (a lot of improvements in layout/readability were made).  I also printed out, cut, and inserted all the official updated hero cards for the 5 base heroes.  I find the game is much easier to play with these updated card layouts, but if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want them, the original cards are in the sleeve as well, so simply pull out the printed insert and throw it away.
As for shipping, I will do my absolute best to pack everything to avoid any damage.  I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make promises for the postal service, but I will do all I can to ensure the game gets to you in perfect condition.  If you are in the Chicagoland area, perhaps we can arrange a meetup so you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to pay for shipping.
If you have any questions, feel free to geek-mail me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to answer as best I can.

    <notes>This is a full KS1 Captain pledge for Myth and several add-ons.
It will include the 2.0 materials for it all, once MCG prints and ships all the 2.0 materials to me. Once I get them, I will forward them to the purchaser of this pledge at no extra charge.
All the stretch goals are included, which also includes the rare and coveted Twilight Knight boss, and Donnchahd (sp??) and several of the add-ons that affected the game play.
These include Ia, the Foundation elemental boss, The 3 Agents of Darkness, an extra set of lairs, Item Pack 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2, Quest Packs 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2, sleeves for all the heroes, the Skald Hero, and the Spriggan hero.
Some of the miniatures have been painted, and you can see them all here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/images/boardgame/all?username=Ghool
All I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m wanting to do is get what I paid for the pledge. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it because I have found a dungeon crawl that is less complicated that I am able to play with my kids. Myth has sat unused for two years due to the complexity.
All of the painted miniatures are painted well, and look great on the table. Most of the heroes are painted, as are the traps and a couple of the bosses. The pledge is largely un-painted, and all of the insectoid minions have had their bases and giant, ugly posts removed from their undersides. The orc lairs are also removed from their plain bases, and I have built a scenic and thematic base for both.
Otherwise the game is in brand new condition.
Keep in mind that this is 20lb. box that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quite large. It will be costly to ship, but the amount of stuff in it is astronomical. This is a great starting point for anyone wishing to get into Myth, and has plenty to keep anyone entertained for a long time.
Buyer will pay actual shipping costs in addition to the price.</notes>

    <notes>This is a NIS first edition box with the second edition materials included as received.  The shipping box was opened to verify the contents were present as expected.
Shipping from 78628 to be paid in addition with delivery confirmation required.  This is a fairly heavy box at just over 10 lb including packaging, with the shipping box measuring 17.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 5.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. This means this does not fit into a USPS flat rate box.  I will be happy to ship by your preference, or I will default to USPS.</notes>

    <notes>Huge Kickstarter lot.  Please note that not everything below is included now.  The only thing that has been sent from the 2nd Kickstarter is the 2 base boxes and the 2nd ed materials for the first shipment.  I will change the address in the pledge manager to yours, and you will get the remainder when they ship it.  Please note, I cannot guarantee you will get anything.  You will get what they ship.  If anything comes directly to me, I will pay to ship it to you, but if they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t send it, you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get it.  The things I list as in-hand are guaranteed.  The remainder is up to Megacon Games.  Full disclosure, there has not been great communication for a few months.
From 1st Kickstarter.  These have been opened and played with, but I take good care of all of my games, and they are from a smoke-free home.

    <notes>Includes Original game (version one), all the materials for update 2.0 (new manual and cards), stretch goals from the original kickstarter (monster packs, Sprigand, lairs, etc) and a couple of optional extras. Also includes the second Journeyman kickstarter with Blackwall Warrens, The Shores of Kani, all the stretch goals and a lot of additional purchases - UNOPENED.
I bought this to play with a gaming group that has now disbanded. Some of the parts are painted (see photos), some have been used a couple of times, but most of it is unopened.
[b]Notes[/b]:
From the original game, some of the models have never been used, some have been painted. From the Journeyman Kickstarter none of it has been used and most (if not all) will be shipped without being opened.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m still waiting for delivery of some of the journeyman kickstarter, due September 2017.
What I currently have weighs 12.5kg and almost fills a space 50x45x35 cm

    <notes>This is the Myth Journeyman KS: Hero Level Pledge.  Includes Shores of Kanis and Blackwall Warrens, along with the base game.
SOK and BW boxes are like new, never played just without the shrink wrap.  Myth main box is in good condition, with some mild wear on the box.  I can send photos if needed.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a ding smaller than a dime and one corner has a ding.
Buyer pays shipping.  I can get an estimate beforehand if needed (keep in mind that the boxes for this aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t small).</notes>

    <notes>Multi-Kickstarter pack, including:
Kickstarter edition of base game (all stretch goals from original Myth Kickstarter)
2.0 updates for the base game
Journeyman expansions released to date (wave 1: Shores and Blackwall big boxes, not including stretch goals)
Note that this doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include the stretch goal for Journeyman, since those have not been generally released. Willing to discuss including the fulfillment of those in for the buyer but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t give any timeline, as the creators themselves don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have one.
In great shape, missing one basic cardboard insert (so that everything can fit into the three boxes).</notes>

    <notes>Myth 2.0 - Second Edition (Purchased Jan. 2016 for $120)
If you are looking for a good copy of this game, this is truly a great example and a good deal on this Out of Print Gem!
Meticulously Maintained components and cards. Only Played ~3 Times (Couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ever get a good group together :( my loss your gain!) 
No wear and tear on any game components or cards, Cards were sleeved before ever play handling (see below):
     All Hero Cards sleeved with Myth Card Sleeves, which I purchased with the game and am including in the sale.
     All Item and Other Cards Sleeved with Matching Myth Sleeves as available 
     Some cards are sleeved with plain clear sleeves since you need to see both sides, a few cards are not used frequently and I did not sleeve them
     In addition to card sleeves, I also printed out and built the very nice Tuck Boxes (from bgg no less) for storing ALL cards, also included in the sale!
          - https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/99172/myth-tuckboxes-sleeved-cards
     One corner of box is torn slightly :( due to the very tight fitting lid unfortunately.
Includes ALL Original Game Contents:
   1 v2.0 Rulebook
   5 Hero Boards
   1 Darkness Board
   10 Realm Tiles
   41 Plastic Miniatures
   15 Dice
   309 Cards
   304 Tokens
PLUS EXTRA ITEMS:
   Myth/Clear Card Sleeves for ~95% of cards
   Printed Tuck boxes for ALL card stacks
   A couple Printed Scenarios and items/enemy cards for campaign play
$70 OR BEST OFFER!
PayPal Only, Price does not Include Shipping Costs
Will consider pick-up/drop-off  (Western PA/Pittsburgh Area and Cash Sale ONLY)</notes>
