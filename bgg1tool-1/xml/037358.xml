   <description>Newest game from the pair that made 1960: The Making of the President. The goal here is to be the founding father with the most renown at the end of the game, which consists of the making of the US constitution._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each round, an article of the constitution is put up for consideration, which is either a Federalist, Anti-Federalist, Big State, or Small State issue. Players have a hand of three delegate cards that represent their respective states and also have a special ability. Players may use these cards' special abilities, use the cards to vote for or against the issue under consideration, or to try and claim tokens in each of the four types of issues. When a round ends, the issue either passes, or is flipped to its opposite side (Federalist/Anti or Big/Small)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players score points for having voted with the majority, and also for having tokens matching the issue types that are voted into the constitution._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Jolly Roger Games (JOL 1787)
Founding Fathers is a board/card game for 2-5 players by Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, the designers of 1960. In Founding Fathers, players seek to be the man remembered for the creation of the United States constitution via skillful play of state delegations, debate, and the personalities of the attending delegates. Each delegate has his own special power as well as a factional alliance--federalist, anti-federalist, etc. Founding Fathers is currently available direct or through quality game stores and historic sites.</notes>

    <notes>This sale item is the 2010 (first) printing of Founding Fathers.  This copy of the game has been played once.
The 40 blocks have been stickered.  All counters punched.  All components are accounted for.  The rules are in very good condition.  The 55 cards were in card sleeve protectors when played.  (They are out of the card sleeves now.)
The game box shows some damage.  During shipment, the game box top was scraped somehow near the top left corner.  There is no damage to the box structure, just the ink rubbed off the bend in the box for about 3 inches.  The game box top corners also have that ink _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;rubbed off_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; look.  The game box bottom is in much better shape with no visible signs of damage.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>Jolly Roger Games (JOL1787)
Founding Fathers is a card driven game where you are a delegate at the Constitutional Convention. A unique game of strategy, politics and luck, you and the other players strive to form a more perfect union and be remembered in history as a founding father. Just as the original founding fathers had to do, players must balance the demands of your faction, negotiate with other delegates, work through the committee process and deliberate in the Assembly Room. Can you replace James Madison as the Father of the Constitution? A fine family game, this game is also an excellent learning tool and is an excellent choice as an alternative means of education for teachers and home schooled children. </notes>

    <notes>Never played, perfect condition.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if there was an insert in the box originally, but if there was I must have deemed it useless and tossed it, but the game is nicely stored (see pic).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 76oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Jolly Roger Games (JOL1787)
Founding Fathers is a card driven game where you are a delegate at the Constitutional Convention. A unique game of strategy, politics and luck, you and the other players strive to form a more perfect union and be remembered in history as a founding father. Just as the original founding fathers had to do, players must balance the demands of your faction, negotiate with other delegates, work through the committee process and deliberate in the Assembly Room. Can you replace James Madison as the Father of the Constitution? A fine family game, this game is also an excellent learning tool and is an excellent choice as an alternative means of education for teachers and home schooled children. </notes>

    <notes>Description: 
Founding Fathers is a board/card game for 3-5 players by Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, the designers of 1960. In Founding Fathers, players seek to be the man remembered for the creation of the United States constitution via skillful play of state delegations, debate, and the personalities of the attending delegates. Each delegate has his own special power as well as a factional alliance--federalist, anti-federalist, etc

    <notes>Version - First Edition
Condition - Unplayed, partially punched. Box is in excellent condition with very little shelf wear. Contents are most unpunched (stickers on sheet, cards in shrink), rest look freshly punched. Rulebook clean and like new condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.95 (small), $13.10 (medium), or $17.90 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
