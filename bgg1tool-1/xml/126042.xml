   <description>From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Nations is an intense historical board game for 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay introduction_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Buy a card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Deploy a worker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Hire an architect for a wonder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Special action provided by a card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;See 'More information' below for link to rules, etc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

How will you lead your nation? Conserve your resources, or spend on military? Send your people to work, or invest in their national heritage? Avoid famine and war, hire workers and architects, and raise wonders that will stand the test of time. In the end, only one nation can rise to the top. A deep, challenging game, Nations will force players to make difficult decisions and deal with unpredictable events. Balance future growth with the need for current resources. Deploy your people as soldiers or laborers. Invest in progress or hire architects. Create new buildings or establish colonies. Hire advisors to take you through the ages, and create a nation to outshine all the rest. </notes>

    <notes>Game has been played once by two careful adults.
I will send this game to the eventual buyer using a courier delivery service.
 To most mainland UK destinations the p _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; p cost will be £7.50. Some more remote areas, such as the Scottish Highlands, will cost more. I am sure you are aware of this already.

A deep, challenging game, Nations will force players to make difficult decisions and deal with unpredictable events. Balance future growth with the need for current resources. Deploy your people as soldiers or laborers. Invest in progress or hire architects. Create new buildings or establish colonies.

    <notes>Game played several times but the components are in very good shape.  Some of the boards and play mats have some wear at the corners.  The box has some light shelfwear around the corners and edges.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also a very light indentation of my name (thanks Mom!) on the cover - see upper left hand corner of picture.
Feel free to ask for the shipping cost.  I generally mail games USPS Priority, but this one is big, so I can check USPS Standard prices too - just let me know what you want.</notes>

    <notes>The blue player color is missing 1 wooden disk, used for marking ( 4 out of 5 disks are present ). This fifth disk is used only to remind the player what _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;difficulty_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; they are playing at. Players can optionally play at different difficulty levels, but this is easily remembered, and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t change throughout the game.  
The game is quite playable without this disk.
Otherwise, the game is in excellent condition.</notes>

One corner of the box was damaged during shipping and the insert was torn from the components moving around (see pictures).

Max shipping will be $15. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only charge you exact shipping charges up to $15. If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pay the difference. Been sitting unplayed on my shelf for far too long, deserves a home where it will see playtime.</notes>

    <notes>I am at least the 2nd owner of this game.  The cards are in excellent condition as well as the rest of the components.  The insert is breaking down/warped.  The rule book shows some wear but is in good condition.  The box has some corner wear but is overall in great condition.   Buyer pays for shipping. I will ship via USPS.  This will not fit in a flat rate box so I will have to find a box to ship in.</notes>

I will ship via USPS, UPS, or Fed Ex at my discretion.  The box is large so shipping is $18</notes>

    <notes>Lieber Interessent,
ich biete hier mein Exemplar von _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Nations_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; an - Erste Edition in deutscher Sprache. Ich habe das Spiel ca. 3-4 x gespielt - der Zustand ist im Grunde wie neu. Wird gerne gut sortiert schnellstmöglich versendet - oder auch gerne per Abholung, da die Box ja auch etwas größer ist.
Bei Fragen kurze PM an mich. Versand als Paket müsstest Du tragen - liegt bei DHL derzeit bei 5,99 € (Stand Dezember 2018) - dies aufgrund der Maße der Box.
Viel Spaß beim Shoppen und Spielen.
Herzliche Grüße aus Frankfurt,
Manuel</notes>
