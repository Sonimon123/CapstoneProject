   <description>In Dragon's Gold, each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Eurogames (EGD 2633)
Each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they only have one goal: the gold, silver, the jewels, and the magic objects. Actually killing a dragon? It is a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.
As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all dragons/treasure has been accounted for, the round end and scoring is based on not just the raw value of the various types of gems, but also includes bonuses for who has most of certain types, as well as variety.

Each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they only have one goal: the gold, silver, the jewels, and the magic objects. Actually killing a dragon? It is a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.
As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all dragons/treasure has been accounted for, the round end and scoring is based on not just the raw value of the various types of gems, but also includes bonuses for who has most of certain types, as well as variety.</notes>

Each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they only have one goal: the gold, silver, the jewels, and the magic objects. Actually killing a dragon? It is a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.
As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all dragons/treasure has been accounted for, the round end and scoring is based on not just the raw value of the various types of gems, but also includes bonuses for who has most of certain types, as well as variety.</notes>

    <notes>Eurogames (EGD 2633)
Each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they only have one goal: the gold, silver, the jewels, and the magic objects. Actually killing a dragon? It is a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.
As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all dragons/treasure has been accounted for, the round end and scoring is based on not just the raw value of the various types of gems, but also includes bonuses for who has most of certain types, as well as variety.</notes>

    <notes>Eurogames (EGD 2633)
 
Each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they only have one goal: the gold, silver, the jewels, and the magic objects. Actually killing a dragon? It is a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.
 
As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all dragons/treasure has been accounted for, the round end and scoring is based on not just the raw value of the various types of gems, but also includes bonuses for who has most of certain types, as well as variety.</notes>

Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html
Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.
I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.
Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!
I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>
