   <description>This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it warm._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Upon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The boardgame significantly broadens the original game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s universe and emphasises the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM: The Board Game is an INSTANT PLAY game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In war, not everyone is a soldier._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

- Rubble Die
The game is supposed to ship in early summer according to the latest update. 
It should be possible to still change the shipping address, so in the optimal case, there won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be additional shipping costs. However, if changing the address doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t work, the buyer will pay the additional shipping cost from Switzerland or will pick it up in Lucerne (Switzerland).</notes>

    <notes>This is for the english kickstarter version of the game with all stretch goals. 
Like new - Opened and punched all parts, played only once.
IMPORTANT! - Note that this version has fully painted resin miniatures - Painted by Awaken Realms as part of the kickstarter - see photos.

* Dog and Cat resin miniatures fully painted
* Orphans of War resin miniatures fully painted
* Farmers resin miniatures fully painted
* Sewers resin miniatures fully painted

Full kickstarter edition and stretch goals. Been played once, our group didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t enjoy it as much as we hoped. I take great care in taking care of my games, and you can be assured this is, effectively, in new condition minus the shrink wrap and the pieces being punched out.</notes>

    <notes>Played a handful of  times. Includes all the Kickstarter streatch goals and the following paid add-ons:
Incidents expansion
Memories expansion
Rubble Die
All stored in the base game box. Original insert removed, but counters are stored in a GMT counter tray. I do have the stretch goals box if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d want it, but it will make shipping more expensive. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just basically just an unnecessary brown card box that says _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;stretch goals box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on it.
Also includes the Lords of Hellas promo figure, no box.

    <notes>This is the TWOM Kickstarter edition (English) including all stretch goals and:
- Heart of the City expansion
- Tactics expansion
- Sewers expansion
- Farmers expansion
- Orphans of War expansion
- Memories from the Past expansion
- Incidents expansion
- the resin cat miniature
- the Lords of Hellas promo miniature (unrelated to this game, but it was included in the box by the publisher)
Physical condition: the game was opened, sleeved, and set up for play one time, but was played for less than one game turn, so all components are in like-new condition. None of the sealed envelopes have been opened. None of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;consumable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; parts of been used (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;save_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; sheets, blank cards, blank tokens).
The pictured token organizer box is included in this sale, as are the card sleeves. If the buyer does not want the token organizer, i will package the tokens (unsorted) in a plastic baggie and reduce the cost by 10 Euros.
Complete photo album:

Weight: approx. 3.5kg
Ships from Southern Germany.
Reason for selling: simply can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get into it. i apparently lack the necessary level of empathy.

    <notes>Brand new Kickstarter version with all stretch goals.  Core box is still in shrink and the stretch goals come in a bag and separate box (one stretch goal punch board has a couple cardboard pieces loose).  The stretch goals box also includes the Lords of Hellas promo miniature with Sundrop shading on it.  Let me know if you have any questions.
As for shipping, it will be $15 ... buyer pays exact shipping.  I will ship whatever is cheapest via FedEx/UPS/USPS. If shipping runs over $15, then I’ll cover the difference. If it’s less than $15, I’ll refund the difference. With the stretch goals box, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if this will fit into a Medium Flat Rate box, but it should fit in a Large Flat Rate box for a worst-case scenario.  Payment will be via PayPal.  Local pickup available in Dallas/Ft. Worth area, but contact me first about pickup location/cost.</notes>
