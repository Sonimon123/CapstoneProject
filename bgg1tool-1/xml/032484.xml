    <notes>Your Move Games (YMG 022)
Hill 218 looks just like any other hill on your map, but High Command says it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your job to take it.  Unfortunately the enemy has the same plan.
 
What You Get
 
The Battle for Hill 218 is an abstract strategy card game for two players, taking 15 - 30 minutes to play.  It’s easy to learn but has a depth of strategy usually found only in games that take an hour or more to play.  The deck box comes with everything needed to play: two army decks, two pairs of Air Strikes, the Hill 218 card and the rulebook.</notes>

    <notes>Your Move Games (YMG 022)
Hill 218 looks just like any other hill on your map, but High Command says it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s important and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your job to take it.  Unfortunately the enemy has the same plan.
 
What You Get
 
The Battle for Hill 218 is an abstract strategy card game for two players, taking 15 - 30 minutes to play.  It’s easy to learn but has a depth of strategy usually found only in games that take an hour or more to play.  The deck box comes with everything needed to play: two army decks, two pairs of Air Strikes, the Hill 218 card and the rulebook.
 
Basics of Play
 
You begin play with the Hill 218 card in play and two face-up air strikes set off to the side of play.  One side of the hill is your home base; the other is your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  You win the game by occupying both bases; if neither player manages this, the player with the most units remaining when all units and air strikes have been played wins. 
                                
You will deploy unit cards, such as 
Tanks, Infantry and Heavy Weapons, onto the board.  In order to advance you will need to maintain supply lines and do battle with enemy units blocking your path.
 
Who would enjoy The Battle for Hill 218?
 
Hill 218 has the simplicity and quick play of a perfect filler game, but has a lot of strategic depth as well.  The Your Move Games team still breaks it out every chance we get (especially Darwin and Chad who play pretty much any time they have a deck and fifteen minutes handy).</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had to raise rates for single game shipping as USPS has raised theirs. The more games you buy though, the less it makes a difference and I will combine shipping happily. For one game you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking at around $14, but each additional game will only cost you $3.

    <notes>Cards are in great shape, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been played with but are really heavy card stock and very clean.
Buyer pays actual shipping.  Probably a first class padded mailer.  I would guess less than $2 but maybe a slight bit more.</notes>

    <notes>The Battle for Hill 218 is a tactical card game for two players that takes about ten minutes to play, but has a lot of depth. 
﻿You begin with Hill 218 in play and two face-up air strikes. One side of the Hill is your home base; the other is your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  You win the game by occupying both bases; if neither player manages this, the player with the most units remaining when all units and air strikes have been played wins.
