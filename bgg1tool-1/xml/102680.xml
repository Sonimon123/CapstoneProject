   <description>Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome. </notes>

Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome. </notes>

    <notes>Passport Game Studios (PGS102)
 Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome. </notes>

 Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome. </notes>

    <notes>Passport Game Studios (PGS102)
Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.</notes>

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>Passport Game Studios (PGS102)
Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.</notes>

    <notes>Passport Game Studios (PGS102)
Set in ancient Rome Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence trading military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. What are trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.</notes>

    <notes>The shrink is missing but the game has been unopened and sitting on a shelf for years. All the components are brand new and unpunched. The only thing is the box has some signs of shelf wear (a small ding on bottom see picture).
Shipping to continental US is $10
Hawaii/Alaska add an additional $15</notes>

    <condition>good</condition>
    <notes>I selected good because of box condition, but components are pristine.
Received game from PO with split corners (3 bottom, 1 lid) which were taped with scotch tape. I removed the tape and glued the inside seams with clear craft glue. I have had great success doing this with a great many games, and this game is no exception. It perfectly sound for storage vertically, and will store just fine horizontally (I just wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bury it). I would give the box a 6/10 in due to these corner seams. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s structurally sound for vertical storage or horizontal storage (just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t crush it under a ton of boxes). The front looks nice and clean. Components are pristine.
Precise shipping. I need you full address to provide a quote. I estimate east cost at $6-8 and west cost at $12.
I am pretty sure I have the version labelled correctly. My copy only has english rules.</notes>
