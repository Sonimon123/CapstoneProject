   <description>Marvel Heroes is a game set in the Marvel Universe for 2 to 4 players, with plenty of opportunities for cooperation and competition between the Super Heroes controlled by the players. Players take control of a group of Super Heroes (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Marvel Knights or the Avengers) as well as the Nemesis of one of the other player's group (Magneto, Dr. Doom, Kingpin or Red Skull). During the game, each player finds allies, enemies and power-ups, and face the menacing Super Villains controlled by the other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;High-quality plastic figures of many of the major Marvel Super Heroes, including Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four and The X-Men, as well as of the Nemesis characters, are included in the game. Each character featured in the game is represented by a detailed 40 mm plastic figure and an accompanying character card describing the character's special abilities. Power-ups can be added with special effects, which are different depending on who is acquiring these bonus items, so that all the different incarnations of the character can be played._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I am going to get this one played very often. It is unpunched but unfortunately the Mr. Fantastic figure was damaged in transit to me when I ordered it, and I had to glue his arm back on. Apart from that this is what you would refer to as new. You will pay postage on this game, it is pretty heavy (1.5kg, so that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about £6.50 first class if you want it shipped that way).</notes>

    <notes>Game is in great shape. I played this just once.
Note: 
The map art is pulling up a bit from the board (as the game probably sat on the shelf for some time prior to me buying). Still very playable, but it does come up from the inside where the board folds (ie the center). I can provide a picture if you are interested. If you were to spend some time with it unfolded it would likely flatten out a bit more.</notes>

Inventoried and is complete.  All mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s appear to be in tact.  Every thing seems to be in very good to like new condition... except for game box which overall is in like new condition except for some minor shelf wear on 3 of the upper top corners, hence I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to call it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; since I know the type of buyer for this game could be a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and may want 100% perfect.</notes>

Everything is in very good shape, except for the board.  It does not want to lay flat, and some of the adhesive is no longer holding the map firmly to the cardboard.  I have pictures of the components in my gallery.</notes>

    <notes>Usual warping of the board for this game, which caused the paper on the board to peel off of the cardboard, so I glued it back on. It created bubbles in the back of the board but the front is fine. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also taken measures to correct the warping but it could happen again. Still, it wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t warp enough for it to not be playable. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mainly a cosmetic flaw. Everything else is in great condition. I contacted Asmodee customer service and they do not have replacement boards anymore.
Buyer pays for shipping (which should be under 20$ anywhere in Canada). Can be done in person if in Montreal. Do look at my other games for sale to see if a bundle could save you some shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>[b]Condition:[/b]
Contents/box in good condition.  EXCEPTION: Boards for this game were notorious for warping.  Years ago I tried back-bending the board and it snapped at one of the seams.  So, I took a razor blade and cut along all of the seams, then lined them up and re-attached each section with clear packing tape.  (See picture.)  Game is actually playable now, but the board is held together with tape.

[b]Shipping Options:[/b]
I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)
UPS Ground
FedEx Home

    <notes>Condition is nearer _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. The components are barely used and the box shows only the very lightest of scuffs.
The package approaches 2Kg in weight so it may cost up to £25 postage dependent on location and postal service choice. I am willing to negotiate with the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for a used copy of Marvel Heroes in good condition. The box bottom has a long tear in one end that does not appear to affect the box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s structural integrity. The Daredevil mini was separated from the base when originally purchased but has been carefully reattached with professional modelling glue and the underneath paper backing is starting to separate from the base of the main board. The board also has the common fault associated with the manufacture of this game in that it does not automatically lie flat without something heavy (eg a pile of books) first being placed on it for a short while prior to playing (see photos).
All reasonable offers will be considered.
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs that will depend on buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s location.
Overseas shipping can cost a lot and will always be via airmail with delivery confirmation/tracking: please ask before buying.
Buyer responsible for any and all Import/Customs charges.
I can combine multiple purchases to reduce shipping costs where possible.
Additional PayPal purchase fee (5%).
No additional fee when funds sent direct in British pounds (e.g. sent not using a credit card as the source of funds in PayPal when using the family/friends option, personal cheque, bank wire transfer, cash, etc).</notes>
