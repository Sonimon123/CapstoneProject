   <description>Caesar at Alesia simulates an epic battle in 52 BC where Julius Caesar surrounded the battered forces of the Gauls led by Vercingetorix.  Knowing the Gauls had a relief force coming (of over 250,000 men), Caesar built a defensive perimeter facing outward to match his perimeter facing inward to beseige Vercingetorix.

The Gauls have a small force trapped in the town including Vercingetorix as well as a large force which sets up in off board areas.  The Gallic player must reveal which off board zones he occupies with at least 1 unit, but does NOT have give further information._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of the game is for the Gauls to create an escape route for Vercingetorix and exit him off the board.

Buyer pays for shipping.  Cashiers Check and Money Orders accepted, PAY PAL preferred.  Payment is expected to arrive and clear before games will ship.  Shipping charges are those quoted by the USPS for shipping the item(s) (http://www.usps.com/prices/priority-mail-prices.htm).  Please note that the game(s) will ship the Saturday following payment clearing (sorry but I work days and evenings and usually can not get to the Post Office before then).  Additional pictures furnished upon request.
Best wishes,
Jon

    <notes>In 51 B.C., Vercingetorix led 80,000 starving Gauls from the besieged city of Alesia and threw them against the surrounding Roman fortifications in concert with attacks from without by a relieving force a quarter of a million strong. What followed sealed the fate of Gaul. Can you succeed where he failed?
Julius Caesar with ten tested legions maintained an investment of a force larger than his own while fending off a relieving force 250,000 strong. Outnumbered 6-1, defending a tactical _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;doughnut_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; against a simultaneously expanding center and contracting perimeter, Caesar accomplished a feat which astounds historians to this day.
Caesar recreates on a large 28_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 33_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, full colour mapboard the epic battle of Alesia, unique in antiquity and all of recorded warfare, in highly playable classic form in a game as exciting as the battle itself.
Complete and in excellent condition.</notes>

    <notes>This is an unpunched copy. In addition there is a bag of counters from another copy I used to have which has long since gone, essentially 2 sets of counters. The bagged set is missing one piece which has been replaced with a home-made counter. The game is in excellent condition, the box has some shelf wear but is in excellent condition for age, no split corners etc...
The game is 100% complete.
Will post Worldwide and accept Paypal.</notes>

    <notes>The box shows shelf wear especially at the edges and corners. The lid has three split corners. The inside of the lid has one spot of water damage. The contents are in excellent condition though. All counters are accounted for. The die had gone missing. I replaced it with a six sided die. The game is complete.

BUT...
it does come with what I think is a huge bonus - the edition of The General Magazine that covers the game with insight, strategy, tactics, etc. That is the first thing I always want when I get a game - articles about it.

    <notes>Punched, bagged and sorted but with issues:
Rulebook is a photocopy
Counters are verified as complete but there are four substitute counters: 2 Barbarian, 1 Roman, 1 Fort.
There are more fort counters than you likely need so no playability issue there. Substitute unit counters are scanned and Photoshopped so look just like the originals.
The map is in mint condition except panel 3 (of three) has encountered some water on one edge. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s about two inches in. Fully legible and undamaged but paper a little wrinkly.
Basically a fine playable copy but not for the collector or purist. Also good if you want parts. The substitute unit counters are:
Roman XV-2
Barbarian Pictones (7-6) unit 3
Barbarian Andi (5-6) unit 2
and a generic Fort counter
Still, more fun than clunky GMT version.

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £6.50
European Postage: £13.50
Rest of World Postage: £25.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:

The upper box has 2 opened corners; all the components are like new and unpunched. It comes with some prints from General magazine about the game.
 INTERNATIONAL BUYERS - The shipment charges are based on shipping a parcel  by International Guaranted Mail with tracking number. The costs depend both on the zone you live AND the weight of the parcel. I am considering 3 different ranges of weight (from 250 to 350 grammes/ from 350 grammes to 1 kilo/ from 1 kilo to 2 kilos). Most of the games are in the 350 - 1 kilo range. In the case the parcel would weight more than 2 kilos (as in a case of a combined shipment) I ll have to ship it by another mean (i.e. QPE or EMS) and have to recalculate the costs. Anyway for any doubt or questions, please, feel free to ask in advance. I am also glad to upload more pictures if needed.
Europe and some African countries : 10,60/ 14,40  / 21,10 euro.
US, Canada, other countries of America and Africa: 13,90/ 20,00 / 29,90 euro.
Oceania : 17,80/ 26,70 / 37,80 euro.
In the case of a miscalculation in your favor I ll refund any eventual surplus charge.</notes>

    <notes>All games are complete to the best of my knowledge, if I have any doubt I sell it as pieces.
I am a non-smoker.  The games have been stored in a dry basement in bookshelves. 
I wrap all the games I sell in plastic to prevent damaged. The game come with trays in them, if they came with them or I if added them.
I also use a professional mailing company. They do a good job in packing and insurance. Never had a problem with them.

    <notes>My late husband collected board games.  Didn’t always play all of them, but he loved to collect. Time to find new homes for the games.  He took excellent care of his games, and if they were played, no food or drinks were allowed near  the game playing area.</notes>

Bought new way back when and kept, unplayed all these years. Time to sell, unfortunately.</notes>

    <notes>Contents are in very good condition except rule booklet shows wear along spine. Game was missing 2 counters; 1 of 20 white counters with the word “Disrupt” on them and 1 of 15 pink counters with a horse head and 2-15 printed on it representing the First Squadron of Caesars mercenary Germanic Cavalry. I made replacement counters by copying existing counters of the same type. See pictures. Counters have been verified by reference to pictures of unpunched panels on BGG.  The box top has one split corner and tape remnants on all four sides (See picture). The box bottom is intact with slight rough spots where tape was removed.
I will ship USPS Priority Mail with cost based on destination, weight and box dimensions. For this game box is 15.5 x 12.5 x 3.25 inches. Weight is 3 lbs, 6 oz. You can calculate shipping charges on USPS website (www.usps.com) based on your Zip Code and my Zip Code, 95829. I will confirm shipping charges when I know destination. Local pickup is also acceptable.</notes>
