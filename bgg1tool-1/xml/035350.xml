    <notes>Dan Verssen Games (DV 1002)
You take on the role of Alexander the Great in his world-conquering quest to extend the Macedonian empire and achieve personal glory. 
When we started designing the game, our goal was to represent the battles of Alexander the Great, but the more we learned about him, the more we realized our opportunity to explore not only his battlefield exploits, but also the other aspects of his life. True, Alexander the Great was highly skilled in warfare, but he was also a skilled negotiator and at his core was the constant drive to connect with the gods. It was rumored that his father was Zeus, and he spent much of his life seeking the favor and advice of the Greek gods. 
When playing the game, you are placed in Alexander’s footsteps when he comes of age in 338bc, just before the battle of Chaeronea. From that point on, you get to decide where to travel, when to battle, when to negotiate, and when to seek out divine prophesies to guide your actions. 
You are supplied with soldiers and advisors to help you navigate the dangers of the battlefield and the negotiating table. These include Infantry, Archers, Phalanxes, Cavalry, Advisors, Scholars, Courtisans, and Spies. You will craftily combine these resources with your own plans to achieve victory, and glorification. And if you do well, you will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders ever to walk the earth. 
The life of Alexander is divided into several campaigns, each spanning several years. During each campaign, you are given goals, but how you achieve those goals is up to you. Do you enter into battle? Or negotiate? How strong are you? How strong are they? What can you gain? These are all decisions you get to make, and must make well, if you are to live up to the immortal standards set before you. 
The campaigns can either be played stand alone, or linked to play through his entire life. When played as one on-going life, the outcome of one campaign affects your starting situation in the next campaign. 
How you proceed is up to you - The Entire World is Yours for the Taking!

    <notes>This game was purchased new from an online store and counters were punched.  I have laid them in the counter sheet for this picture to show they are all there.  
While looking through rule book, staples started to come off of pages so I put the individual sheets inside new sheet protectors to protect the rule book.  These rules in protector sheets will be included in shipping box with the game but not in the game box itself. 
This game was never played. I thought I might like a wargame, but I decided otherwise after reading rules.  I seem to be a Eurogamer.
PayPal only and shipping within continental United States only please.
Non smoking, non pet home. Adult owned. 
One rate shipping anywhere in the continental United States is only $ 7.50</notes>

    <notes>DVG (DV1 002)
You take on the role of Alexander the Great in his world-conquering quest to extend the Macedonian empire and achieve personal glory.
When playing the game, you are placed in Alexander’s footsteps when he comes of age in 338bc, just before the battle of Chaeronea. From that point on, you get to decide where to travel, when to battle, when to negotiate, and when to seek out divine prophesies to guide your actions.
You are supplied with soldiers and advisers to help you navigate the dangers of the battlefield and the negotiating table. These include Infantry, Archers, Phalanxes, Cavalry, Advisers, Scholars, Courtesans, and Spies. You will craftily combine these resources with your own plans to achieve victory, and glorification. And if you do well, you will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders ever to walk the earth.
The life of Alexander is divided into several campaigns, each spanning several years. During each campaign, you are given goals, but how you achieve those goals is up to you. Do you enter into battle? Or negotiate? How strong are you? How strong are they? What can you gain? These are all decisions you get to make, and must make well, if you are to live up to the immortal standards set before you.
The campaigns can either be played stand alone, or linked to play through his entire life. When played as one on-going life, the outcome of one campaign affects your starting situation in the next campaign.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete, from non-smoking home. Note that rulebook pages have some crinkling due to normal use, plus 7 places in the 16-page rulebook where there was writing added in pencil (but since erased). There are 4 mounted boards included in this game, whose tendency to warp has been extensively addressed on threads on BGG --including proposed solutions. I have kept them continuously secured by multiple large rubber bands when the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not been in use, but when in play the boards still have a tendency to bow slightly--although not enough to affect game play (i.e., placing pieces on the board and keeping there there during normal play). This seems to be a problem particular to this game.</notes>

    <notes>Field Commander Alexander.  Complete and in Great condition.  Played maybe once or twice.
Buyer prepays plus priority mail shipping,  I would guess about 10-12.35, as I think this will fit in a medium flat rate, but we could beat flat rate depending upon where in the U.S. you are.</notes>

    <notes>Dan Verssen Games (DVG1002)
You take on the role of Alexander the Great in his world-conquering quest to extend the Macedonian empire and achieve personal glory. When we started designing the game, our goal was to represent the battles of Alexander the Great, but the more we learned about him, the more we realized our opportunity to explore not only his battlefield exploits, but also the other aspects of his life. True, Alexander the Great was highly skilled in warfare, but he was also a skilled negotiator and at his core was the constant drive to connect with the gods. It was rumored that his father was Zeus, and he spent much of his life seeking the favor and advice of the Greek gods. When playing the game, you are placed in Alexander_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s footsteps when he comes of age in 338bc, just before the battle of Chaeronea. From that point on, you get to decide where to travel, when to battle, when to negotiate, and when to seek out divine prophesies to guide your actions. You are supplied with soldiers and advisors to help you navigate the dangers of the battlefield and the negotiating table. These include Infantry, Archers, Phalanxes, Cavalry, Advisors, Scholars, Courtisans, and Spies. You will craftily combine these resources with your own plans to achieve victory, and glorification. And if you do well, you will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders ever to walk the earth. The life of Alexander is divided into several campaigns, each spanning several years. During each campaign, you are given goals, but how you achieve those goals is up to you. Do you enter into battle? Or negotiate? How strong are you? How strong are they? What can you gain? These are all decisions you get to make, and must make well, if you are to live up to the immortal standards set before you. The campaigns can either be played stand alone, or linked to play through his entire life. When played as one on-going life, the outcome of one campaign affects your starting situation in the next campaign. How you proceed is up to you - The Entire World is Yours for the Taking!</notes>

    <notes>I am the original owner of all this entire lot, and the games come from a smoke and pets free home.
INTERNATIONAL BUYERS - The shipment charges are based on shipping a parcel  by International Guaranted Mail with tracking number. The costs depend both on the zone you live AND the weight of the parcel. I am considering 3 different ranges of weight (from 250 to 350 grammes/ from 350 grammes to 1 kilo/ from 1 kilo to 2 kilos). Most of the games are in the 350 - 1 kilo range. In the case the parcel would weight more than 2 kilos (as in a case of a combined shipment) I ll have to ship it by another mean (i.e. QPE or EMS) and have to recalculate the costs. Anyway for any doubt or questions, please, feel free to ask in advance. I am also glad to upload more pictures if needed.
Europe and some African countries : 10,60/ 14,40  / 21,10 euro.
US, Canada, other countries of America and Africa: 13,90/ 20,00 / 29,90 euro.
Oceania : 17,80/ 26,70 / 37,80 euro.
In the case of a miscalculation in your favor I ll refund any eventual surplus charge.
 
Thanks for looking</notes>
