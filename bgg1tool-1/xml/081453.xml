   <description>Prepare yourself for a fierce duel. Cleverly use the features of the four different families to snatch the most valuable gangsters away from your opponent. Your goal? To have the best gang at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Famiglia, the players collect gangsters with the goal of collecting the highest-valued gangsters. With the exception of the 0-value gangsters, a player normally needs two identical gangsters (same family and same value) to be able to take a gangster with the next highest value of the same family. When a player does this, they place one of the smaller gangsters from their hand into their play area. To get higher-valued gangsters faster, the player may use the special abilities of the different families at the cost of placing more gangsters in their play area. By doing so, a player may reduce their options and so must carefully plan these actions in order to end the game with the most influential gang._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 431)
Type: Card Games
Number of players: 2
Age of players: 10+
Length: 30 minutes
Game Description: 
The players control two rival gangs and try to recruit additional gang members from the four families (La Famiglia, The Accountants, The Brutes, The Mercenaries) on the Street. The player, who uses the special abilities of the different families better than his opponent, will get the most influential gang and win the game.
The players collect gangsters, with the goal of collecting the higher-valued gangsters. With the exception of the smallest gangsters (the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;0_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards), a player normally needs two identical gangsters (same family, same value), to be able to take a gangster with the next higher value of the same family into his hand. When he does this, he places one of the smaller gangsters from his hand into his play area (the area near him on the table). To get the higher gangsters in a faster way, the player may use the special abilities of the different families, but at the cost of placing more gangsters in his play area. By doing so, however, a player may reduce his options and so must carefully plan these actions so that he can end the game with the most influential gang.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but never played (cards are still sealed even though the box is not).  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $5.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO431)
The players control two rival gangs and try to recruit additional gang members from the four families (La Famiglia, The Accountants, The Brutes, and The Mercenaries) on the Street. The player who uses the special abilities of the different families better than his opponent will get the most influential gang and win the game. The players collect gangsters, with the goal of collecting the higher-valued gangsters. With the exception of the smallest gangsters (the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;0_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards), a player normally needs two identical gangsters (same family, same value), to be able to take a gangster with the next higher value of the same family into his hand. When he does this, he places one of the smaller gangsters from his hand into his play area (the area near him on the table). To get the higher gangsters in a faster way, the player may use the special abilities of the different families, but at the cost of placing more gangsters in his play area. By doing so, however, a player may reduce his options and so must carefully plan these actions so that he can end the game with the most influential gang. </notes>

I will ship from Germany and I am willing to ship anywhere.
Please ask me, for the shipping costs for your land.
I will charge shipping at cost. Everything will be well packed.
You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.
If you buy more games, then I make all in one package!
We have a large private collection of games. Due to space and time constraints we must rid ourselves of some of the games. Therefore, these are private sales.</notes>
