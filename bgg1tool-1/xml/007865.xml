Shipping is the shipping cost, plus $2 for anywhere in the continental U.S., and shipping cost plus $4 for elsewhere.  
Also, I have lowered the prices of all my games.  They will be at this price until the end of August, and then I’ll pull them and sell them at a local gaming convention.  I look forward to doing business with you!

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Box top is split in all four corners; otherwise this well made game is in great shape. My count doubled when I married my wife. It seems she’s a keeper, so need to keep both copies. We LOVE this game and will continue to play the surviving copy.</notes>
