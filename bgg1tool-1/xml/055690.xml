   <description>Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.  Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Campaign System_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Embark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;choose your own adventure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Monster AI System_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gear System_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Story Event System_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>for I AM LEGEND:
Sale of Kingdom Death: Monster pledge manager login.
(original forum post for verification):
So...just got laid off at work and looking to bring in a little extra cash. 
My pledge:
Survivor, Domestic Shipping. 
Paid for addons:
Flower Knight Expansion1
Dragon King Expansion1
Gorm Major Expansion (includes Regeneration Suit)1
Dung Beetle Knight Expansion1
Spidicules Major Expansion1
Sunstalker Major Expansion1
Slender Man Expansion1
Promo: Kara Black1
The most recent KS update they have stated that they will be reopening the pledge manager soon, so you could add even more addons if you wanted at that time.
The transaction will be conducted through the BGG marketplace to ensure that BGG gets its cut.
What you will get: I will provide you with my login and password for the pledge manager (as well as a courtesy link to the PM) allowing you to change the shipping name and address, as well as add additional items when they reopen the pledge manager. I can make no guarantees about being able to change the shipping address from a domestic US address to an international address, so caveat emptor if you do not live in the US.
What I am asking:
My actual pledged amount was $390. I would like to at least not incur much loss, so I am asking for $420. This means that I will receive $394 after the paypal and BGG cuts. Please PM me if this interests you, or if you would like to make a *reasonable* counteroffer.
Repeat for clarity:The transaction will be conducted through the BGG marketplace to ensure that BGG gets its cut.
Buyer will be expected to mark the transaction as completed on the BGG marketplace once I message with the login/password. Once I have provided the login/password, I have delivered the promised merchandise. This is a purchase of a kickstarter pledge manager login. Delivery of the final product is an issue for the buyer to take up with the company responsible for fulfillment of the kickstarter rewards.

    <notes>This is a private auction for spera32.  No other buyers, please!
This sale is for my Kickstarter pledge for  yet-unreleased game Kingdom Death: Monster.  I will attempt to have the shipping address changed through the Kickstarter campaign.   If I am unsuccessful in this and the game arrives at my address, spera32 will pay postage to Italy.  In the event that the game is never released or is defective in any way, spera32 will seek redress with the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s publisher directly, and not through me, since he is now the full owner of the pledge.  In making the purchase of my pledge, spera32 agrees to these terms.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for a brand new, unopened, in hand, Survivor level Kickstarter version of the game.  
The box is almost 22 pounds, quite large and packed with game content; inside is the KS version of the Base Game and the Survivor box of extras. Note the Survivor box is the same size as the separate miniature box inside the Base Game, so it would seem close to as many miniatures are in it as the Base Game so quite an addition to the game.  
Please see here for exactly what you would be getting, these are the two boxes inside the shipping box: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kkcxA0FHEE     (not my video)  
Things to keep in mind for this listing:  
 - The base game ONLY is selling for $400USD from Manufacturer, currently OUT OF STOCK
 - Current exchange for credit card or paypal on $400USD = ~ $545CAD
 - The Survivor level box is the same size as the separate miniature box inside Core Game
 - Shipping from USA to Canada will be very costly AND could incur duty, taxes, brokerage fees etc 
This will be a limited time listing, after which if not sold it will likely be taken down and put up on Fleabay for a somewhat higher price to account for the extra fees they charge.  
Shipping will be actual cost nothing more, due to high cost of game insurance recommended, signature required mandatory.  I did an estimate from Toronto to Ottawa and it was ~$20, surprisingly low.  
Pick up in GTA available and possible delivery as well. If someone pays cash, Bank Interac or pays paypal fees sale price of game will be reduced to $535.00. Feel free to PM with questions or to get shipping quote.</notes>

    <notes>**Does not come with any minis**
Selling all the game components *except* the minis.  I sold the minis earlier (not into complex assembly) intending to play the game with proxies.
After punching and sorting the remaining game components and reading through the rulebook decided the game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me.
Everything is punched/unwrapped and sorted but unplayed.

    <notes>This game has been opened. We read some of the manual and did detach a few of the miniature parts, however we realized that this game is too much for us. All of the parts are included and nothing is damaged. No glue was used. Three of the log sheets were started. Available for inspection and discounted (no shipping) pick-up in San Diego. I have a great eBay history for reference.
USA shipping is included. I will ship internationally however I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ask for up-front payment of $100USD and will refund the difference in actual costs to ship. All Customs loss risk is on the buyer.</notes>

    <notes>Selling my Kingdom Death: Monster core/base set.
The core set is in great condition, the tokens are all unpunched, the cards are all still sealed, everything is still new on sprue EXCEPT the first 4 survivors and the first monster (the lion) are all assembled.
The 5 figures that are assembled have had the seams filled with liquid green stuff (the KD stuff is a bit notorious for having bad seams). They may could do with another round of green stuff, but I think they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be fine once primed.
The top left corner of the box has some normal shelf wear.
I can provide photos on request of the above descriptions.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to get $330 for the set. Note this game is really heavy, like ~17lbs or so. You will need to give me your zipcode if you want me to try and get an estimate for shipping. Note that it will probably be in the $25-$30 range for something that heavy. I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t overcharge though, if I end up overcharging for shipping, I will refund you the difference.
I also live in the central Maryland area, so if you wish to save quite a bit on shipping, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind local pick up.</notes>

    <notes>We are offering the KD monster game, including the KS bonus male twilight knight and everything that came with our pledge.
Also included is the Flower Knight Expansion, as well as some cards from their booth at Gencon 2015. 
All the miniatures have been snipped from their sprue and are sorted in baggies. W
We decided to sell off a lot of our games, and we never ended up playing this game, so all we did was take things out of shrink wrap for the most part and flip through the book a few times!
Shipping will be fairly expensive, we will need a postal code to get quotes.</notes>

    <notes>Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really want to sell as it has rave reviews but realistically, I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see me getting round to doing it justice.
I have looked inside the (massive) box but nothing has been opened.
I will post at cost if you really want but I would imagine it will be very expensive! 
However I will be going to UK Games Expo on the Sunday and i could exchange it there
P.s. It also includes the Twilight Night bonus sprue which came separately.</notes>

    <notes>Base game of Kingdom Death with several minis already mounted (don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry, you still have a few in spruce that you can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;work_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on in your spare time!). The game is in very good condition. Cards are sleeved day 1 (but not the tiny square cards, I could not find a sleeve size for those).
You will receive everything that is pictured (that is a complete core set, except for the GenCon promo). The forth survivor is still in spruce but will be mounted before shipping.

I would very much prefer to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;deliver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; the game to save on shipping which is likely exorbitant due to the size and fragility of the models....(e.g. multiple boxes)

    <notes>This is the survivor level pledge of the game and the Gorm expansion, minus the t-shirt which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve already worn. Shrink wrap on the outer box was removed to look at the manual, but plastic on the minis is still fully intact and no parts are damaged in any way. UPS manage to damage the original shipping box by ripping a corner, but with a bit of packaging tape it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still usable if you would like it included. The Gorm expansion is still in the unopened original shipping box. Shipping will run around $50-70 at the lowest end (within the U.S.), and I will cover insurance for the full amount.</notes>

    <notes>Hello fellow board gamers! 
The cards, tokens (plus the big envelope with replacement tokens), book etc. have never been used in any way! 
The box was opened only to built and get painted the 6 miniatures by a pro as seen in the photos! (the Butcher is much darker). The miniatures are much cooler up close, took the photos with my mobile phone. 
All other miniatures still on spruce on their box!!
So the game is ready to start your campaign as soon as you get it!!! 
I will ship the game with registered package worldwide but please, ask me for total shipping costs!!
Regards!</notes>

**Minor damage to rule book**
The rule book has been spiral bound with clear protective sheets on both covers. During the binding process the machine_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s teeth took small bites out of the top and bottom edges of the book in line with the holes for the binding. Damage is purely cosmetic and does not interfere with the text.

In Sprue:

This is the original Kickstarter backing.  It has sat safely on my shelf.  Had every intention of playing my copy but was never did and now need the shelf space.

    <notes>This is the retail version that sold about a year ago (i.e., no Kickstarter extras).
I built and put some paint on the 4 initial survivors and the white lion. I think they turned out pretty good. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like my paint job, you can soak them in Green Stuff to get them back to their naked state. All other parts are still on the sprues.
The box came with an odd crease on the top.
I will have UPS pack and ship this game to insure safe arrival, and use bubble wrap inside the box.
Add $30 for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>ALL ARMOUR KITS + INTIMACY COUPLE + MASKS
Selling all the sprues in the core game except the 4 starting survivors and the 7 monsters.
Also included are all the game cardboard sheets unpunched (142 tokens and terrain tiles).
The sprues include all 7 kits (rawhide, leather, lion, screaming fur, phoenix, lantern, unarmoured) that allow for 4 figures each (28 figures) plus the intimacy couple (2 figures) plus the masks and all the bases needed. Every gram of plastic in the miniature box is included except the 4 starting survivors (and their stone face bases) plus the 7 monsters (and their larger bases).
This full additional figure set is a must for any completionist who wants to avoid magnetizing. Let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s say you already built your armoured survivors with whatever weapon combo you chose at the time. Now you find that there are weapons that you hardly equip in the game so your miniatures never match your gear grids. Or maybe you have an awesome survivor with a phoenix armour and a pair of hollow swords that is wreaking havoc and you want to immortalize it in a miniature. This is a chance to create new figures or combinations different to the ones you already built.
Even if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t own the game and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re only interested in the miniatures this is a great value for 30 KDM minis.
Based in Barcelona but I travel a couple of times a year to the US _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the UK so could ship domestic to if you are willing to wait.</notes>

    <notes>This is a PRE-ORDER for the base game from the most recent Kickstarter, version 1.5. The included picture actually doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t show all of the components because there were additional miniatures unlocked during the campaign. 
At last update it was scheduled to be delivered in Summer of 2017. I ordered a retail package and will be parting with 5 of them. I will ship them out as soon as I get them and will keep buyers updated. Be aware that delays are possible but as of yet there are no announced delays. Shipping is INCLUDED in the sale price for the continental USA. This is a very large and heavy game (literally), so shipping will not be a trivial expense for me.</notes>

    <notes>This is for Satan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Lantern Pledge + these extras already paid in BackerKit:
Death Dice,
Death Drifter - Kingdom Death x Hyper Light Drifter Crossover,
Goth Amy, the Unraveling - Kingdom Death x Zombicide Crossover,
Lantern Year 3 Candy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cola - Kingdom Death X Soda Pop Miniatures Crossover and
Pathfinders of Death - Kingdom Death x Paizo Crossover.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m aware that I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been the most active of geeks in the BGG over the years, so trusting over such a huge sum can be an issue, but besides my full contact information I can provide my eBay and huuto.net (finnish auction site) feedback if interested if that helps a bit.  Would really love to keep this pledge to myself, but being a student (actually took a loan just for this game) and if the price is right I might be able to release this crown jewel.
If a deal is made, I will change the address in the BackerKit to yours, so the stuff would come directly to you, whenever they start shipping.
Payment would be made either via PayPal or Wire Transfer (in EU). If via PayPal, buyer covers the fees.</notes>

When you buy, I will change the shipping address to yours and forward you any and all kingdom death updates or information. This means you get the game at the same time as anyone who pledged (end of August according to KS). I will also send you the link to the pledge manager if it reopens where you could buy more addons directly.
I was really excited for this game but with a kid on the way and the friend I would play it with moving away, I think its best to sell. Kill the Watcher and Gold Smoke Knight for me!</notes>

    <notes>I have come to terms with the fact that this game is just too much for me and I simply won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the appropriate time for it as much as I want to. I own nothing Kingdom Death and so I curated this to be the best bang for your buck and best variety of different nodes. I am not looking to make money off this, just recoup my initial pledge. I did have a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Black Friday Gold Lantern_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; pledge so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll save $50 off the bat in comparison to normal pledge prices. Upon payment I will forward you the pledge link, update the shipping address and assist in any way possible I can. Feel free to check my feedback on eBay also; http://www.ebay.com/usr/aberrix

    <notes>This is a PRE-ORDER for the base game from the most recent Kickstarter, version 1.5. 
At last update it was scheduled to be delivered in Summer of 2017. The deadline for that is rapidly approaching and I have not heard an update... I suspect it will be this fall. I ordered a retail package and will be parting with 5 of them. This is my LAST copy. I will ship them out as soon as I get them and will keep buyers updated. Be aware that delays are possible but as of yet there are no announced delays. Shipping is INCLUDED in the sale price for the continental USA. This is a very large and heavy game (literally), so shipping will not be a trivial expense for me.</notes>

The game is new/sealed (just arrived yesterday 10/19).  
YOU WILL ALSO HAVE TO PAY ACTUAL SHIPPING CHARGES.  To calculate these, got to USPS.com and type in  your zip code and my zip code (85284).  The package will weight about 22 pounds. It is a large package, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also have to type in these dimensions: 26 X 15 X 7.</notes>

    <notes>Kingdom Death 1.5. Brand New, sealed, in shrink, perfect condition, still in box it got shipped in, I will just close the box back up and send it to the buyer.
Will ship anywhere in Europe, inquire for price estimate (this is a 10 kg box). I will not send it uninsured so expect costs to be 20 euros or higher (except Benelux, that will be cheaper). 
It would be possible to pick the game up in person in Brussels, Belgium.
Buyer to pay any currency conversion fees Paypal transaction may incur.

    <notes>Selling the complete game. You will see from the pictures it has been played. We played through it once. I do not feel the need to keep it. I did build a good number of the figures and all the monsters but the Gold Smoke Knight. All tokens, pieces, cards, and dice are present. The box has little wear, but some. We used almost half of the survivor deck but I have printed off a bunch of copies of the original sheets and the remastered sheets with more details for your survivors. 
I am happy to take more pictures. I will not ship it outside the US and buyer pays all shipping.</notes>

Starting survivors, old and young, intimacy couple and a couple of lion and leather armor kits built -  all other armor kits unbuilt and like new.
All monsters built.   
Models built, cleaned, and filled/sanded for painting.  Not undercoated yet, still bare plastic.  The larger monsters will have to be mailed separate from the base game.
All card components lightly used for about 5-6 games.  Rulebook does show some wear.
Will ship in original shipping box - monsters separate - so shipping will be 40 or so.  A slight discount form buying it brand new, but you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to build anything to play.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling new expacs on BGG, so look at them as well.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played through the first two lantern years, and is in impeccable condition.
I thought this game was for me, but it really isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t my thing.
All cards are sleeved with FF card sleeves with the exception of the 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; item cards.
I put the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because only the starting 4 miniatures are painted with this scheme https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/48047/kingdom-death-monster, and the first 2 creatures (Lion and Antelope).
All other miniatures have not left the original box.
If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the scheme, simply prime over it and begin again.
This price does not include shipping, but I will notify you of the shipping cost/total from my location if you are serious about buying.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to answer any questions.
Best regards,
Mike</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling what is essentially a Core v1.5 game, complete with new, unopened miniatures box. This is a v1.0 edition that has been upgraded via the 1.5 Upgrade Kit, as well as some newer parts that have been swapped in from a fresh 1.5 Core. Since I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to provide as close to a new v1.5 as possible, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll list the individual components and where they came from.
All cards, settlement events, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; settlement locations have been in sleeves since opening the original v1.0, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be shipping it with everything still sleeved. (A $45 value at current sleeve prices)
Box Tray - New, from a v1.5 Core Edition
Miniatures - New, unopened, from a v1.5 Core Edition
Showdown Board - from v1.0
Hunt Board - New, from v1.5 upgrade kit
Rule Book - New Hardcover, from v1.5 upgrade kit
Tokens - from v1.0, with additional new from v1.5 upgrade kit
Gear Grids - from v1.0
Character Record Sheet Pad - New, from v1.5 upgrade kit
Settlement Record Sheet Pad - New, from v1.5 upgrade kit
Black/White Dice - from v1.0
Orange Die - New, from v1.5 upgrade kit
Settlement Events - v1.0, with new v1.5 replaced, all sleeved
Settlement Locations - v1.5, with new v1.5 replaced, all sleeved
AI/HL/Hunt/etc... - v1.0, with new v1.5 replaced/added, all sleeved
Gear Cards - v1.0, with new v1.5 replaced/added, all sleeved
If you want it shipped, I have the exact same shipping box that a v1.5 core came in, so it should be well padded. Buyer pays exact shipping (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get a quote ahead of time from zip code to zip code). I can also meet if a reasonable driving distance in Connecticut.
Will accept Google Pay (Gpay) or cash if being delivered in person.</notes>
