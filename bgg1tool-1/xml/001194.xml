   <description>In Speed Circuit, each player takes control of a Formula 1 racecar zipping around the tracks.  Each person then distributes a number of points to Start Speed, Top Speed, Wear and other attributes, five points per lap.  Then, each player moves based on their speed, and can adjust their speed, choosing to forfeit a Wear Point, or roll the Chance Die, where a bad roll could cause you to move through, spin out, or even crash out of the race.  Whoever gets over the line first wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Before the race begins the players prepare their cars by allocating points, so if you want faster acceleration or speed you have to sacrifice start speed or braking or tire wear._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, the players write their planned speed for the next turn and then move their cars 1 space per 20 mph. Each curve on the track has a speed limit that cannot be exceeded without penalty. If you exceed curve speed, overaccelerate or overdecelerate your car, etc., you pay penalties in tire wear or possible damage to your car or elimination from the race._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The original 3M Sports Games version used speedometer wheels to select speed, used a random card draw to determine the car characteristics and has no random elements._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: British Grand Prix_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Detroit Grand Prix_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de Belgique_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de France_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: South African Grand Prix_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Tournament Tracks_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Speed Circuit: Turnier Kurs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The box is a little beaten up: it has a split corner, a small tear in the bottom, some tape residue.  The bottom is uneven because bubbles have appeared in the glue; nothing serious.
The boards have a little wear on them (see photos) and are from two different sets (the backs of two are black, the backs of the other two brown).  Board 4 has been torn apart and will need to be fixed.
The only thing missing are the six cars.  You can easily use generic markers or Micro Machines to replace them.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill version and includes three extra track segments taken from their mag. The cars aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the pretty ones shown in the main pictures here, but the original small plastic ones in a solid colour. All components are in good condition and the box looks like new.
This game has recently been going for around forty bucks on ebay, but I prefer to deal with BGGers and also support the site through commissions - the price is set accordingly.
I would expect shipping to be around EUR 18 to the US, less in Europe obviously.</notes>

    <notes>A 100% complete copy. This is the original metal car version.  The contents are in good condition overall. One of the six original metal cars has a missing rear wheel, it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect anything.  See the pics.  The box has moderate shelf wear and a crease along one corner of the lid where there is a ding.  There are two minor discolorations on the lid however, the box is solid with no split corners. View the pictures for details.  
Buyer to pay postage not to exceed the USPS Priority Mail Flat rate of $8.95. I will provide exact postage upon learning the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s zip code. I am willing to ship via USPS Priority Mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is least expensive or at the option of the buyer. International buyers need to contact me for rates. International buyers are required to pay using Paypal.</notes>

    <notes>Beautiful copy of the original 3M release with metal cars. Scoring pad appears to be almost complete.

Shipping charges are my cost only (postage and box). Combined shipping available and I will use flat rate boxes when available. Please let me know if you wish for the shipment to be insured.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Sports Illustrated / Avalon Hill version.  The box is taped, and shows wear (but is intact).  It’s definitely used, but there are still quite a few Performance Charts left (along with lots of photocopies of them).  The rules are present and in good condition.  The original cars are missing (and have been replaced with plastic cars). 
For shipping, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge the shipping cost, plus $2 for anywhere in the continental U.S., and shipping cost plus $4 for elsewhere.  
Also, I have lowered the prices of all my games.  They will be at this price until the end of August.  I look forward to doing business with you!</notes>

    <notes>Speed Circuit 3M Slipcover 1971
This game is completely playable! Pieces are in excellent condition!
Being on the outside, the plastic-coated board is going to have some light scratches and rubbing, but it is intact; no tears that I can see; plastic snap closure is also intact and works; no tape remnants.
Contents:
Gameboard, each side being a different track.
6 Speed Calculators
6 Start Cards
6 Metal Cars
One Card/Scoresheet holder
One Performance Chart (NOTE: there is no black marker pencil with the game. A crayon will work nicely)
Rules 
NOTE: there is an inner cardboard box which holds the components (see photos). At one point, this whole unit—inner box and outer track/board—was taped together. I managed to successfully remove the tape and tape goo from the outer plastic coated board, but on each end of the inner cardboard box, there is still a bit of tape remnant that I dared not remove because it would likely tear the cardboard. At one end, the tape was partially removed and a little bit of the gold lettering came off with it.
The inner box otherwise is in very good condition. 
Buyer pays actual postage on three pounds shipping weight from my zip of 98338. I will supply delivery confirmation. No handling fee. I will ship internationally. </notes>

    <notes>Klee version.  Contains rules in English including 3M and Avalon Hill versions.  This game is in fantastic condition - only played once.  ! minor annoyance - 6 of the 18 plastic widgets that connect arrows to speedos were missing - I imagine suitable replacements can be found easily but given that there are two versions of speedos and you only play with one version you never need more than 12 of the widgets anyway.  This is such a bargain - I picked it up cheap and it is one race game too many for me hence the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;giveaway_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; price.  UK postage is £5 by Collect Plus. </notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill / Sports Illustrated SPEED CIRCUIT 1977 Edition
Originally part of the series of sports games put out by 3M in the late 60_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and early 70_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the game was later produced under the Sports Illustrated line of Avalon Hill.   There were some changes made to the game but overall the game play remained similar.  
The game parts are in VERY GOOD-EXCELLENT condition.  The game has been verified to be 100% complete with all the parts that were originally included in this edition of the game accounted for.  With the exception of the cars having some broken wheels everything is in nice shape.  Overall I would grade the game parts 6-7 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).
The game box is in VERY GOOD condition.  It has one split corner and has suffered some crushing.  No stains or writing.  I would grade it a 5 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below). 
ABOUT THE CONDITION OF MY ITEMS:
I grade all my items according to condition (see guide below).  I inspect the condition of all of my games very thoroughly and I inventory all the parts so you can be sure they are absolutely complete. In the case of stats based replay games I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even list them for sale unless I have gone thru all of the cards and matched them against a roster list. Because of all the time I put in I list my games at a high price but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m hoping that you the bidder are willing to pay a little extra for being assured that a game really is COMPLETE and really is in the condition stated.
ABOUT SHIPPING:
I always combine shipping and I have a large selection of other APBA items for sale so be sure to check my other listings to see if there is anything else you need.  All items are carefully packed to ensure their arrival in the condition advertised.  See shipping calculator for shipping charges within the USA.  I charge only actual shipping costs, no handling fee.  Contact me for international charges.
CONDITION GUIDE:
MINT (10):  I will only give this grade to brand new, unused items.
NEAR MINT (9):  Shows virtually no use.  Seldom if ever played.  Cards will have at worst some dented corners from shuffling around in the box.  Perhaps some very light handling creases to the instructions or other minor flaws with the game parts.  Boxes will have only the slightest hint of shelf wear.  
EXCELLENT (7-8): The game has seen some use but it was obviously well taken care of.  Cards may have denting to the corners, perhaps a few may have light stains or other very light handling wear but the vast majority will be close to flawless.  Game parts might have some light handling creases or other signs of careful use.  Board might have just a hint of color loss or dented corners.  Boxes will have light rubbing to the artwork or perhaps some minor dishing or a very light stain.  
VERY GOOD (5-6):  The game was not especially well cared for but it still has faired pretty well.  Cards will have dented corners and perhaps some may have rubber band wear to the edges.  A few cards (less than 10%) may have handling creases, yellowing to the edges (a few may be yellowed on the faces), or light stains.  Perhaps a couple may have writing or some dried rubber band residue (this will be noted).  All card results will be fully readable.  Other game parts will show obvious use but nothing will be torn, badly stained or have any serious damage.  Box may have some rubbing, light staining, dishing, 1 or 2 neatly split corners, minor writing and/or a few pieces of tape.  No major structural damage and artwork will still be generally attractive. 
GOOD (3-4): Obviously no care was taken with the game but it is still playable as is.  Cards will show moderate to heavy use and many will be yellowed, stained, creased, written on or have rubber band residue.  A couple may be torn and taped back together.  All card results will be fully readable.  Other game parts show considerable use but the game is complete with all parts in usable condition.  Box may have staining, writing, split corners, dishing and/or other structural damage but it will be intact and still usable.  
POOR (1-2):  Only suitable to fill a space in your collection.  Cards are heavily worn and some are badly damaged.  Game will be missing parts (these will be noted).  Box will have serious damage and may be missing aprons or badly torn.</notes>

    <notes>This game is part of the series of sports game released by the 3M company during the 1960_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and early 70_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  The series includes Football, Baseball, Hockey, Golf, Auto Racing, Horse Racing and Yacht Racing.  I have heard that they also produced a Basketball game but I have never come across one.  
These games all have the same basic format - a slender box containing the game components with a wrap-around vinyl playing board.  All of the games in this series feature high quality game parts.   The 3M catalog was later bought out by Avalon Hill who continued to produce most of the games in the standard AH bookshelf format until their demise in the mid 1990_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  This Baseball Game is one of the exceptions.  It has been out of print since the early 1970_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.
The game parts are in VERY GOOD condition.  The game has been verified to be 100% complete with all the parts that were originally included in this edition of the game accounted for.  The instructions, race chart, speed dials and start cards all show typical handling wear. The metal cars are in nice shape. They are all totally intact, with nice paint, with the exception of the green car which has lost one wheel.  Overall I would grade the game parts 5-6 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).
The game box is in GOOD condition. All 4 corners of the lid have split. The box bottom is in better condition.  I would grade it 4 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).  The wrap-around vinyl playing board is in EXCELLENT condition. No tears or significant creases.  The snap is intact.  I would grade it 7-8 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).
