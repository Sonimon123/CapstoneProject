   <description>Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hera _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>My copy is one of the first printing misprint copies.  The green cards have purple backs and the purple cards have green backs.  It has no efect on game play.  I am hoping this will make it more interesting, but probably not. Feel free to contact me.  I am willing to trade this game.  All reasonable offers considered.  I will ship games the Friday after payment is recieved.  Damn real job!  Make that two weeks for personal checks. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 158)
Hera _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Zeus
Number of players: 2
Age of players: 12+
Length: 30 minutes
Game Description: When Gods feud, the earth quakes! Zeus, the father of Gods, and his wife Hera often disagreed on matters both earthly and Olympic. Eventually, the disagreement became a full fledged feud with both Zeus and Hera calling upon the other Gods from Olympus and mortals from earth to support him or her against the other. Cyclops, Amazon, Medusa, Hydra, Pegasus, and others join the feud. The players take the roles of Hera _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Zeus and use strategy and cunning to pit their allies against the allies of the other. It is winner take all for control of Olympus!

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 2 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>$10.95 for USPS Priority Mail to anywhere within the United States. I will combine shipping for multiple items and buyer will pay actual shipping costs.
My copy of Hera and Zeus is unplayed, and the cards are in Like New condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling over 50 other boardgames and expansions which I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t yet listed on the BGG Marketplace (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m mostly listing the out-of-print games at the moment). Feel free to browse my collection (any game listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;owned_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but not listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;previously owned_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is also for sale) and send me a message either before or after the auction if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in additional games for combined shipping. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling each game for 20% off the lowest online retail price, and almost all of my games are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition - many come with card sleeves, deck boxes, and Plano organizers as well.
And feel free to message me if you would like pictures of this game or any other game that I am selling.
Thanks again!
Jeff

    <notes>(new, opened, sealed cards) Although this intriguing little card game has been described as a more elegant, non-collectable version of Wizards of the Coast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ill-fated games. 
Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture his hostage card from his hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of his actions during his turn.
Components: 
1 rule book
1 Hera block figure
1 Zeus block figure
2 summary cards
86 cards (43 for each player deck)</notes>

    <notes>Never played once I discovered how little text was on the cards. Note the pristine shape for the edges of the cards in the picture.
Shipping cost will be my actual cost at the post office. It should be $4.12 for 13 ounces 1st Class if you choose to have it sent in grocery brown paper bag wrapping. If you want the box inside another box, it will be several dollars more because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll no longer be able to send it 1st class due to the added weight.
If you pay with a money order, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check, or personal check, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to wait for it to clear before sending.</notes>

    <notes>999 Games - Zeus _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Hera
Language: Dutch
Players: 2
Age: 12+
Duration: about 40 min
Weight: 0.340 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards, two Plains alternating with two Mountains, are laid out and 1, 2, 3 or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added. From a hand of 8 Balloon cards must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent’s side - a move that can really ruin the opponent’s plans. High-valued balloons are played on the Mountains and low-valued balloons on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over and refilled with cubes. Mountains becomes Plains and vice-versa. 5 Trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the Trophy card for that color. Players may even trade 3 otherwise useless cubes for 1 they can use. The first player to earn 3 trophy cards is the winner!
