   <description>In this card game based in H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, you play an investigator (represented by a double sized card that has your stats, special abilities and keeps your story organized) who must complete stories without going insane.  From a deck of at least 52 cards you draw 13 and take turns playing one at a time so it moves at a brisk pace.  You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.  When you have fulfilled the conditions you score the card and gain sanity.  In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.  There is a lot of interaction and the Lovecraftian atmosphere is keenly felt._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Mythos Collection:
Over 2200 cards, including the base set and Dreamlands.  (Only missing New Aeon, which is uber rare/expensive).  Never played.
Includes all commons and uncommons.  Missing only about 5 rares (most will have several repeats).
This game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s popularity has ensured that 15 card boosters still go for over $3 on eBay.  That would make this roughly $440 worth of cards.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d accept half that for these unplayed cards.  And I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover shipping within the US.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship worldwide but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be responsible for the costs (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d assume them to be roughly $60+)
-----------------------------------
I also have several sealed Standard game sets.  These are two 52 card decks - one Investigator themed, one Mythos themed.  You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to contact me directly to purchase these as I can only list one item on BGG at a time.  BGG will still get its cut, as always, because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an honest guy.  These are $20 shipped.</notes>

Mythos Standard Game Set (Sealed)
The Haunted House (Mythos generic adventure, suitable for the basic game)
Investigators:
Morose Veteran of the Great War/Inquisitie Chinese Intellectual
The Unfortunate Nephew/Controversial French Mystic
Pragmatic Hobo/Respected New England Doctor
Mad German Inventor/Exuberant Boston Flapper
Capable Graduate Student/Haunted French Sculptor
Cleric of Fading Faith/Grizzled Boston Detective
Earnest Reporter/Staid University Professor
Adventurous Dilettante/Porud Prussian Submariner
Exploited Coal Miner/Bored Housewife (folded)
Widowed Seamstress/Lyric Poet (folded)
Falsely Imprisoned Convict/Overworked Telephone Operator (folded)
Utopian Socialist/Homeless Waif (folded)
These investigators are stuff you got when you bought I think starters or full boxes of boosters.  They basically spice up the game because they are allowed different numbers of cards and starting sanity.  Some also have special abilities that affect gameplay such as the Homeless Waif can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;beg_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for a card.

If this doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell at the price listed within a week or so I will likely break the set up to sell as individual cards - already have some rares/uncommons up for sale listed below.

Also have the following extra individual cards for sale. Feel free to make an offer on these individually - however, if you buy the set I will throw them all in as well, plus all of the commons/uncommons I have - haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t counted how many extra cards that entails, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more than a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;few_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. I will ship the set boxed but unsleeved - the binder pouches will add too much weight.

Condition - New in shrinkwrap.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a very small to small size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>Mixed collection of 130 cards.
I have no idea of their rarities or usefulness, as I never really played it much.
I have put Â£5 as a ball-park figure but, as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure of their value, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also open for offers.
Please contact me for specific queries about the cards.
I will calculate postage upon request.
