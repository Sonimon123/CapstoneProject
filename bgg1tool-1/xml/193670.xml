    <notes>Kickstarter Pledge, painted Necromancer miniature, all cards sleeved, sorting box included!
Very good condition, only played once. All cards are sleeved (the large character cards required manually cutting some sleeves down, so those are not 100% flawless, but offer fine protection. Sleeves for event/search cards are about 1mm short, so not a perfect fit.)
Shipping (only to EU):
Austria: 6€
Germany: 12€
EU: 18€
Feel free to ask for exact shipping costs before deciding.
Meet up in Vienna is also a possibility.
Payment preferably via Bank transfer (IBAN). Paypal is possible, but if not done via _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; include an extra 5€.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter Edition including standees *and* miniatures. Played twice.  
This is a physically heavy game, so expect shipping to run upwards of $25 (hence the lower asking price).
Ships from 95062.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m super OCD with packaging and will do my utmost to protect the box and everything inside of it (see my ratings and trading history; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not kidding).</notes>
