   <description>Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Fate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s specific _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Objective_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s board edge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Orders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Actions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Events_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; both good and bad _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s perfect plan._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad. Radios _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; are represented by their own counters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 0609)
Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of Germany while another player commands either America or Russia. These two players will take turns playing one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards from their hands in order to activate units on the mapboard for various military functions.
There is no strict sequence of play to follow in Combat Commander: each measure of game Time is divided into a variable number of player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Orders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; conducted by the active player. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Actions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Events_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - both good and bad - will also occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player’s perfect plan.
Orders include: Fire, Move, Advance, Recover, Rout, and Artillery functions. Each nationality also has a varying number of Command Confusion Orders which act as duds while in hand.
An example of some of the 20 different Actions are: 
-Smoke - If a unit with boxed Movement is activated to Move, place Smoke in or adjacent to its hex. 
-Hand Grenades - Add +2 when firing at an adjacent hex. 
-Dig In - Place foxholes in a friendly hex. 
An example of some of the 35 different Events are: 
-Walking Wounded - Select one eliminated unit. Return that unit to play in a random hex, broken. 
-Hero - If not already in play, place your Hero in a friendly hex. Rally one broken unit there. 
-Battle Harden - One unit becomes Veteran.
Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent’s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario’s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent’s board edge. Command _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Control is extremely important in Combat Commander, being modeled via the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; number on Leader units. Command serves both to enhance the abilities of Squads and Teams stacked with the Leader, as well as allowing for multiple activations with a single Order.
Combat Commander includes twelve historical scenarios as well as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;roll your own_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; scenario system that provides an almost unending variety of map configurations, combat situations, and historically-based force structures. Each scenario is played on one of twelve maps, each with a 10x15 hexgrid depicting various terrain at a scale of approximately 100 feet per hex.
Replayability for Combat Commander is high. And with unlimited possibilities as far as additional scenarios, maps, units, weapons, variants, etc. that will be released in years to come - as well as the expected sequels covering the British, French, Italians, and the Pacific Theater - Combat Commander is one of those rare exceptional values in wargaming: one that can be revisited time and time again, each with a new tale to tell.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 0609)
Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of Germany while another player commands either America or Russia. These two players will take turns playing one or more “Fate” cards from their hands in order to activate units on the mapboard for various military functions.
There is no strict sequence of play to follow in Combat Commander: each measure of game Time is divided into a variable number of player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more “Orders” conducted by the active player. “Actions” may generally be conducted by either player at any time. “Events” — both good and bad — will also occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player’s perfect plan.
Orders include: Fire, Move, Advance, Recover, Rout, and Artillery functions. Each nationality also has a varying number of Command Confusion Orders which act as duds while in hand.

    <notes>I have a MINT like new copy of Combat Commander: Europe. Also attached to this sale are photocopies I took of optional rules that GMT had printed in C3i issue #21 and of course the counters given in that issue to use the optional rules are given here as well. (and also the additional scenario map #18).
Everything is mint, from maps to box, to cards etc.
Counters have all been neatly and uniformly clipped and will be housed in 3 GMT counter trays.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT0609)
Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of Germany while another player commands either America or Russia. These two players will take turns playing one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards from their hands in order to activate units on the mapboard for various military functions. There is no strict sequence of play to follow in Combat Commander: each measure of game Time is divided into a variable number of player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Orders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; conducted by the active player. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Actions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Events_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - both good and bad - will also occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perfect plan. Orders include: Fire, Move, Advance, Recover, Rout, and Artillery functions. Each nationality also has a varying number of Command Confusion Orders which act as duds while in hand. </notes>

    <notes>A listing for a good condition edition of Combat Commander: Europe. The contents are complete and all the components have been well looked after. All three fate decks have been sleeved since opening as well as all the large card sheets. The original owner has cut the victory track to fit into two separate sleeves. Only very light box wear and some slight creasing on a single map and the rulebook. The rulebook is the second edition so has all the updates. The chit tray is present and good condition. Shipping will be £5 for the UK and £7 for Europe.
Thanks

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT0609)
Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of Germany while another player commands either America or Russia. These two players will take turns playing one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards from their hands in order to activate units on the mapboard for various military functions. There is no strict sequence of play to follow in Combat Commander: each measure of game Time is divided into a variable number of player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Orders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; conducted by the active player. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Actions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Events_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - both good and bad - will also occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perfect plan. Orders include: Fire, Move, Advance, Recover, Rout, and Artillery functions. Each nationality also has a varying number of Command Confusion Orders which act as duds while in hand. </notes>

    <notes>The whole game is in very good condition including the counters being nicely sorted out into two useful counter trays that sit well in the box. One blemish is a small coffee stain on the rulesbook front page. It is about an inch by two inches. Other than that a very worthwhile price. I have not shown postage in case prospective buyer wishes to combine with Combat Commander stuff I have for sale and then I will get a combined price. I am located in North Kent so I am happy with any pick up someone might wish to do instead.</notes>
