   <description>Hera, tired of Zeus' infidelity, decides to take her revenge and releases the Titans on Mount Olympus. In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I have extra Mythic Battle Pantheon pledges to sell. The item will come new and complete with all stretch goals when it is shipped in late December. Note that this is a preorder and the shipment to me may be delayed. 
Payment for the item will be expected now, with an additional payment later for shipping depending on the size/weight of the item once I received it. Will ship worldwide, but shipping will be very expensive outside the USA since the item is likely to be very bulky.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the God pledge with all KS exclusives and the Titan add-on, which nets you an insane amount of content. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a completionist and missed out on the KS, this is for you. See the attached image for how much you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll actually be getting (and according to the KS update, this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even all of it!).
In addition to the core box and 55 achieved stretch goals, the Titan add-on gets you:
1 Poseidon Expansion Box 
1 Hephaestus Expansion Box 
1 Hera Expansion Box 
1 Corinthia Expansion Box 
1 Heroes of the Trojan War Expansion Box 
1 Manticore Expansion Box 
1 Hell Judges Expansion Box 
1 Oedipus VS The Sphinx Expansion Box 
1 Echidna’s Children Expansion Box 
1 Compendium Book 
1 Rise of the Titans Expansion Box 
1 Thermopylae Battlefield
This is a pre-order, the game is slated for a December 2017 delivery. 
Please note, payment for the game will be expected now with an additional payment for shipping as soon as it is delivered.  I will do my best to ship this as economically as possible and will work with you to use whichever carrier you prefer.
I will be happy to ship outside of the US, but know that the price for shipping internationally can be expensive.</notes>

    <notes>** Game received on Friday, and is ready for immediate collection/dispatch **
This is a sale for the Kickstarter Exclusive version (God Pledge), which contains:
- Mythic Battles Panetheon: Core Game
- Titan Boss (110mm high model) 
- Mythic Battles Pandoras Box (Kickstarter stretch goals) including:
      - Apollo Character
      - 86 miniatures (28 are Kickstarter Exclusives)
      - 192 cards 
      - Dice bag, Columns, extra scenarios, modes, and more
The game is new, all boxes shrink wrapped, still in the original bubble wrap from the supplier, and from a non-smoking household. 
The packaging containing the above is substantial (50cm x 40cm x 40cm, 10kg), this will equate to the following postage (sent by DPD):
- UK - £10
- Germany - £25
- Italy - £30
Message me for estimates for other countries. Should you wish to collect I live in Hall Green, Birmingham, England. If you are nearby please message me and we may be able to arrange a nearer collection point e.g. Nuneaton, Droitwich, Sutton Coldfield, Leicester, Ledbury etc
As per my other sales on here, I am selling as I overestimated the number of games that were coming after a substantial Kickstarter spree and need to keep some space in the house (else the wife will kill me).
If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me.
- Darren
Note: I am also looking to sell the below, but have yet to post them here. If you are interested in any of the below there is the possibility of adding it to the box (as long as there is space) and so saving on any postage. Note: I will post the any items of interest from the below list on here so that the purchase has tracked (and BGG get their commission too), I have not added prices to the below as of yet, this is just in case there is interest in addition to Mythic.

It pains me to part with it as the game and minis look stellar, but I have to be somewhat reasonable, and keep a bit of space for other games.
It  will be sent as 2 big boxes (still in the original unopened Philibert boxes), and to the UK only. Shipping will be with done with Parcelforce48, and cost £20.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling a (spare) copy of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, new and unopened.  This is a Kickstarter copy, and includes all of the contents of the God Pledge from the Kickstarter campaign:
* Core Box
* Atlas (Kickstarter exclusive)
* Pandora Box (the rest of the exclusive and non-exclusive stretch goals)
I might be convinced to also sell the following, which are not included in the above bundle; contact me if interested.  They are *currently* still new and unopened.
(Optional Extra) the Hera Expansion (Kickstarter version with exclusive extras)
(Optional Extra) Thermopylae Battlefield Expansion (Kickstarter exclusive)
This is not a preorder; the game is already in hand.  Shipping will be extra; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to work out a preferred shipping option with you.  Shipping outside the U.S. is likely to be prohibitive, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to discuss options.  I live in Los Angeles and am willing to work out local pickup for those interested in saving on shipping.

    <notes>Unopened _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; shrink-wrapped God Pledge with Pandora_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box (stretch goals) and boxed Atlas figure.
I am also selling the following paid add-ons (only as a package):
Corinthia Expansion
Compendium Book
Terrain Set Expansion
Thermopylae Battlefield Expansion
Should you be interested, the total price for the God Pledge with the add-ons is 250 euro. I have a very strong preference to sell everything together, so if I receive interest from someone possibly buying everything, I reserve the right to make the people interested in buying only the base game wait a little (let_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s say not more than 1-2 days in general) before settling the issue.
For shipping quotes, please send me a message with your country and postcode. In case you live within around 400-500 km away from Luxembourg city, shipping may be free (I drive around a lot). Bank transfers preferred, PayPal possible (buyer paying fees).
You can also check the shipping cost yourself (from Luxembourg, postcode 1478) - I found that UPS and DPD work out as the cheapest for this package (the combined package is 50x40x40cm and 12kg), with UPS generally cheaper closer to Luxembourg (+-15 euro) and DPD cheaper further away (+-20-25 euro), in Europe. God knows what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cheap for shipments outside Europe.</notes>

    <notes>Base game box was opened to read the rules, but everything inside is still sealed (cards have never been opened, minis have never been touched, tokens have never been punched).
Includes Pandora_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box KS exclusives + KS exclusive Atlas titan expansion that came with the God Pledge (both ARE still sealed). 
Will ship insured priority mail from 85284. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have one box big enough for everything, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship the base game and Pandora_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box in one big box weighing 22 pounds (dimensions = 13 X 15 X 18 inches).  Atlas will ship in a smaller box for a flat rate of $6.    
This size and weight should give you everything you need to calculate USPS priority mail shipping to your address.  Be sure to add $6 for the separate Atlas package + another $5 for insurance (I will only ship fully insured).  
If my calculations are off in any way, I will refund the difference (or just pay the difference myself).  
Add 3% for PayPal, unless you pay as a friend.  Again, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship insured priority so it will get to you quickly and so we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be covered if there is a problem.</notes>

    <notes>** FOR USER soccpunk111 ONLY **
Sale will include everything as mentioned below, except items from the core pledge (Core box, stretch goal box, Atlas)
PREVIOUS LISTING INFORMATION BELOW:
TYPHON PLEDGE - This is for the all-in Kickstarter pledge including everything. See below for some notes.
(my pictures aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t all-inclusive - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get those updated when I get a chance)
Great game, would love to play more of it. But, my play time is limited, and maybe someone else wants to play it more than I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get the chance to.
Boxes that have been opened (contents are in excellent/like-new condition):
- Core box
- Stretch goals box
- Atlas Titan
- Deluxe Storage Box (which is super nice btw)
Everything else is new in shrink.
Paolo Parente got a little squished, but not enough to warrant needing to open to check contents. Hera and the Atlas boxes both have slight dings from shipping as well - again, nothing that would cause concern for contents, I just feel that I should mention these things. I promise to ship this in better packaging than Monolith/Mythic had it shipped in.
Entire Pledge = $800
** If you want everything excluding the Core pledge (Core, Stretch goals, Atlas), let me know and I may be open to doing that instead.
Shipping - Honestly I expect shipping to run 40-100 depending on your location. I will do my best to keep it low, but especially east coast will be at least 50++. 
Local pickup and/or delivery in Vegas would be ideal, and I can do a cash discount (BGG will get their cut either way). Will ship only to US and maybe Canada.</notes>

    <notes>Mythic Battles: Pantheon God Pledge
Includes:
- Core Game
- Pandora_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box
- Atlas
All components are in great condition. Game was only played once. 
Inserts and Atlas box have been tossed. I started to work on a foam-core insert for this game. Unfortunately we have to move, and I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be able to finish that any time soon.  I will ship both boxes (core and Pandora) with everything neatly bagged and protected. I can include my foam-core start at your option (its my second foam-core, so its very amateur).
I use PayPal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Shipnow service to get discounted UPS and/or USPS shipping, and will get you the best deal possible.
Let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This is the full Typhoon pledge. Everything was opened to verify contents after Kickstarter. Cards are still in shrink, cardboard is still unpunched. Everything is in excellent condition. Not looking to gouge anyone, just looking to make back the money I put into the first Kickstarter. Shipping is from Canada, T1B 2T4. Game is packaged into two 18x18x18 cardboard boxes and each weigh around 20-23 pounds. Cross country shipping in Canada is ~$45 per box.
