   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Brand new, still in shipping box. I ordered two, one to keep and one to sell. This is the Kickstarter version which contains the base retail game plus all five of the Sins expansions, the Omega Team expansion, the Beta Team expansion, plus all of the other kickstarter exclusive extras. You can see an image of it here: http://imgur.com/gallery/2n4E1 or above (I tried to upload it, not sure if it worked).
This is a rather large and heavy box. I will ship insured by either FedEx, UPS, or United States Postal Service -- whatever is cheapest, unless you have a preference. You can get your own quote from one of those services with the following information:
I will be shipping from Des Moines, Iowa, USA -- zip code 50312
The box weighs 18 lbs (8.16 kg) and measures 14.17 inches by 14.17 inches by 17.32 inches (36cm x 36cm x44cm)
Payment by Paypal, or, for 2% off, by Dwolla -- similar to paypal but better</notes>

Have only played once.  Everything is in great condition.  I have everything fit into the core box, the Apocalypse expansion box, and Beta Team box. I threw away all the Sins boxes, the Omega Team box, and the Men of Faith box.  Each of these boxes were flimsy and worthless. All components are in 6mil baggies and properly labeled for easy setup.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter edition of The Others: 7 Sins, including all seven Sins, the Kickstarter exclusives, the additional Beta, Gamma and Omega Team expansions, and the Apocalypse expansion.  All items are in excellent condition but have been removed from outer shrink, although some inner card decks, etc. are still in shrink wrap.  I enjoyed this game but somewhere along the way my wife (primary gaming partner) decided we don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do strictly competitive games any longer, so if I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not playing it someone else might as well be.
Clearly from the pricing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not looking to profit here, just want to recoup some of my initial investment and see the game get played.  Payment via PayPal requested and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to coordinate on shipping however you prefer (cheap or fast)-- you will only be charged what it costs.
Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Items can be shipped in same box used by CMON. Box was opened to verify contents only, no shrink has been removed from smaller packages. The CMON box does not leave a lot of empty space to prevent damage during shipping but I can repack into a larger box upon request.
If you want to estimate shipping quotes: USPS has appeared cheaper but will use buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s choice. Original CMON box measures 14_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;L x 14_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;W x 17_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;H and weighs approx 19lbs. Shipping from ZIP code 27713.
Will ship worldwide for actual cost, but it may be very be expensive.</notes>

Everything is stored in a Plano box (pictures available upon request). Everything fits quite well. I will note that the 6 or 7 red cards from the game (can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember what they were called) are sleeved, as they had a bit of a manufacturing defect/scuff on their backs. I also don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the original boxes anymore.

Following items:

-Of all additionals sins packages, only wrath has been opened to look at it (never used). Greed, Envy, Gluttony and Lust are still shrink wrapped.
-Additional content: Apocalypse expansion (opened to have a look at the minis, never used).
Shipping costs will depend on the destination, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a lot of content/weight, so I cannot do miracles. It will be definitely be cheaper towards Kiala countries (https://www.kiala.com/).</notes>

    <notes>RESERVED for Bond8089
This lot is for all content included at the FAITH level pledge from the The Others Kickstarter campaign as well as the Apocalypse expansion. This includes:
-The Others: 7 Sins base game
-All of the Kickstarter extras included with the FAITH level pledge (all 5 of the additional Sins!)
-The Others: 7 Sins - Apocalypse expansion
The Others base game and KS exclusive content are in very good condition with the exception of the box lid from the base game. There is a clean tear in two of the corners on the same side that was fixed by using clear packing tape. The content from Apocalypse and the other 5 Sins are opened but unused, though the boxes have normal wear thanks to my 4-year-old who loved pulling out the Sin boxes and stacking them. 
The game will be shipped across 8 boxes: The Others base game box, the box for the Omega Team add-on, the Apocalypse expansion, and each of the 5 additional Sin packs has their box as well. I used a DIY storage solution that holds the majority of the content across the base box and the Omega Team box using a variety of Plano-style boxes. Those will also be included in this lot.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m shipping this from Baltimore, MD. Keep in mind that depending on where you live, shipping could be upwards of $30-40 for this lot. If you need a shipping quote, I can do my best for a ballpark for you. Local pickup would also be available in or around the Baltimore area.
I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t consider buyers outside the US unless you have a US shipping address.
Please GM me if you have any additional questions.</notes>

    <notes>Sale is for the full lot (not interested in splitting up at this time). Please email me for shipping costs as the box is heavy and larger than average, so costs may be high in certain parts of the US.

Game is in very good condition only having been played once with many pieces having never been used.
