   <description>Welcome to the wild, weird world of FANTASTIQA!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fantastiqa is a deck-building board game set in a fantastical landscape of dark forests, mist-shrouded highlands, and frozen wastes. As you and your foes journey around the board, you will subdue strange creatures and fulfill fabulous quests._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each creature you encounter has both an ability and a vulnerability. By playing card symbols to which a creature is vulnerable, you can subdue it and recruit it as an ally. Each creature you defeat is added to your expanding deck of cards, making its special ability into an ability of your own! A defeated Enchantress will wield her beguiling charms to help you overcome wandering Knights. Knights in turn subdue Dragons, adding their fiery breath to your cause. By combining the powers of different creatures you can fulfill curious quests, for example:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Send forth your Rabbits of Unusual Size to Nibble Through the Violin Strings of the Violent Vampire Volnar!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Deploy a party of web-slinging Spiders to String a Bridge Across the Chasm of Chaos!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Send your Dragons and Vampire Bats together on a mission to Ignite the Whisker-Wick'd Candle Guarded by the Ice Cats of Kituviel!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Some of the creatures you encounter carry precious gems, which you can spend to purchase powerful artifacts or to summon mythical beasts to your aid. You begin with a handful of household items, but you will grow in power as you adventure and gather allies! By completing quests you score victory points and claim other special rewards.

FANTASTIQA is a deck-building board game set in a fantastical landscape of dark forests, mist-shrouded highlands, and frozen wastes. As you and your foes journey around the board, you will subdue strange creatures and fulfill quests. Each creature you encounter has an ability and a vulnerability. Manipulating these, you can subdue and recruit new creatures. Each creature you recruit is added to your expanding deck of cards, making its special ability your own! By combining the powers of different creatures, you can fulfill quests to score victory points and claim other special rewards. Some of the creatures you encounter carry precious gems, which you can spend to purchase powerful artifacts or to summon mythical beasts to your aid. You begin with a handful of household items, but you will grow in power as you adventure and gather allies! The board changes every time you play, so prepare for a new, exciting adventure each time you enter the world of Fantastiqa! FANTASTIQA is easy to learn but challenging to master - a game for families and gamers alike. Additional simplified rules are included for beginners and younger children. </notes>

    <notes>I am offering the 2012 Enchanted Edition of this game, complete with ALL TRUE EXPANSIONS available so far:
- Kickstarter Exclusive _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Beast of Burden_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
- Kickstarter Exclusive _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Ravenous Raven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
- Fantastic Events
- Treasure Hunt
- Special Delivery
- The Abandoned Abbey
- A Wild Goose Chase, Espresso Dragons _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Exclusive Artifacts
- Fantastiqal Landscapes
- Curious Compansions and Rarest Relics
- Audacious Artifacts
Only the 6 additional characters are missing. I deem them no true expansion, as they only provide a little bit of different artwork, nothing that impacts, changes or enhances gameplay in any way whatsoever. Which is why I never purchased them myself.
The exclusive Kickstarter Promos from the recent _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Rival Realms_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; KS, which are also not in the box, are not available, yet.
The Game has been played once, the expansions never.
All game components are in excellent condition, and ALL CARDS ARE SLEEVED in thicker sleeves (125%).
The box is also generally in excellent condition. However, unfortunately, one side of the box lid has some scratches and is slightly damaged, as well as one of the lid corners (see images). It is nothing major, but needs to be mentioned.
In order to fit it all into one box (and it does fit), I had to remove the plastic inlay. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I have it, anymore, but can go looking, if you are interested in it.
Payment:
Bank transfer to an EU bank account using IBAN/BIC in advance (free of charge)
Paypal (add 3,- Euro to cover the fees. This should be the first choice for non-EU customers.)
I will always ship insured (tracking number included):
Germany: 5,89 (via Hermes)
EU: 15,99€ (via DHL)
Rest of the world: Please contact me before purchasing an item to clarify the shipping costs.</notes>
