   <description>Quartermaster General is a fast-paced game that puts you in command of the major powers of the Second World War. In the game, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies' supply lines and their forces will surrender!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During play, you control one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team and try to score as many victory points (VPs) for your team as you can through the use of cards or by occupying the starred supply spaces. Each major power has a unique set of cards with which to marshal its forces, which are represented by wooden army and navy pieces. After twenty rounds of play, the team with the most VPs wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: The French edition of Quartermaster General, known as Quartermaster, includes the Quartermaster General: Air Marshal expansion that is sold separately in the English edition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Quartermaster General is a fast-paced game that puts YOU in command of the major powers of the Second World War. In Quartermaster General, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies? supply lines and their forces will surrender! During a game of Quartermaster General, you will play one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team, and try to score as many Victory Points for your team as you can. After 20 rounds of play, the team with the most Victory Points wins the game. You earn Victory Points by occupying the starred Supply Spaces, or as indicated on the cards. Each major power has a unique set of strikingly illustrated cards with which to marshal their forces, represented by wooden army and navy pieces. Quartermaster General is simple to learn and quick to setup - but difficult to master. Each game plays differently, ensuring superior replayability! Card driven action combined with traditional map based gameplay make this a thrilling new take in the WWII action/strategy genre suitable for veteran war gamers and casual board gamers alike.</notes>

    <notes>Griggling Games (GGM00003)
Quartermaster General is a fast-paced game that puts YOU in command of the major powers of the Second World War. In Quartermaster General, supply is crucial to keep your armies and navies fighting; destroy your enemies? supply lines and their forces will surrender! During a game of Quartermaster General, you will play one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team, and try to score as many Victory Points for your team as you can. After 20 rounds of play, the team with the most Victory Points wins the game. You earn Victory Points by occupying the starred Supply Spaces, or as indicated on the cards. Each major power has a unique set of strikingly illustrated cards with which to marshal their forces, represented by wooden army and navy pieces. Quartermaster General is simple to learn and quick to setup - but difficult to master. Each game plays differently, ensuring superior replayability! Card driven action combined with traditional map based gameplay make this a thrilling new take in the WWII action/strategy genre suitable for veteran war gamers and casual board gamers alike.</notes>
