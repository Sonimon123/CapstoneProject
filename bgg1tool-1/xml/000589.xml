   <description>In this light, beer _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; pretzels type of game, players are transformed into wizards attempting to collect treasures from a twisted little maze.  At the heart of the game is a deck of cards that the players use to cast spells, power-up spells, and augment movement.  Each turn, players can move up to three spaces (or more with the use of number cards).  However, the goal is to penetrate the other players' sections of the maze, pick up one of their treasures, and bring it back to your home base.  The first player to capture two such treasures or kill all the other wizards is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Wiz-War (eighth edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I list the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played many times, and because it is an older edition, from back when the game came in a small brown box. Included is a set of cards for an internet fan expansion; you could easily strip them out if you prefer. You even get our homemade tiles and counters for said internet expansion; again, strip _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;em out if you prefer.
All original parts are included. If you want to see more pictures, e-mail me and I will take some.</notes>

    <notes>This is my first sale on bgg, I am used to eBay. Sorry for any wordiness.
This is a LOT sale of the 5th Edition Wiz-War (1991). The price is $50 USD, and does NOT include shipping. 
Recent pictures uploaded to Wiz-War show you the condition of the game, including the crease in the box top from top left corner, arcing out and back to bottom left corner. 
The game is unplayed. Counters are unpunched.
Shipping to be paid by buyer. As of Nov 2008, rates to continental US were between $9 and $17 depending upon speed of service. I will ship to anywhere, once paypal payment has been received. Local Pick-up is free of course. (That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s my bid to help out Tourism Toronto!)
I prefer paypal, but would consider money orders if necessary.
I have been having problems with creating sales here on bgg, so this may look weird. Your patience is appreciated. 
Again, please PM me with any questions.

    <notes>This is the classic edition (I believe it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the 7th).  Game is complete with all counters and cards accounted for.  It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear to have been played much if at all, the cards are still crisp showing little to no wear.  The box is a bit beat up however, the cover lid has a corner that is beginning to split.  No excessive damage but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s noticeable that it has been handled roughly.
Shipping rate will depend on your zip code, but since Wiz-War is relatively light, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect it to be more than $8-$10.</notes>

    <notes>6th Edition from Chessex.
Box has some shelf wear but is fully intact and colorful.
Contents are all accounted for, and amazingly all the cards are still in very good shape.  Rule book is mis-stapled, and has a slight imperfection at the top.  Neither affects actual pages of rules or the integrity of the booklet itself.
Probably played around 5-6 times over a decade ago.</notes>

    <notes>Wiz-War Package deal. The Purple “Classic Edition by Chessex (CHX 070000) and Wiz-War Expansion #1 by Chessex (Stock # 7001) New 6th edition. The “New 1993 edition with revised rules and new cards!” version.
The Base set box has some crunched top issues. The boxes are very thin and it is crushed. But the box shows very little shelf wear. The contents are in mint condition. It is punched and the wizard cards are folded over and in their stands. But it was never played and includes the original die. 
The expansion box is in much better shape with only a little top crunch and minimal shelf wear. It is un-punched, but some of the pieces have come out of the frame so I guess it is partially punched.
I am only selling these as a set and the price is $100. I will pay to ship them in the USA via USPS priority mail with tracking. If you live outside the US, I will ship, but you have to pay USPS priority mail flat rate shipping cost and deal with your local customs issues. I will not ship to Brazil.
I can share some pictures or give you more details if you like. I have not sold at BBG before but I have a 100% feedback on ebay for selling mostly games and CCG’s.
Thank you for taking the time to look.

    <notes>Classic Chessex Edition
Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!
