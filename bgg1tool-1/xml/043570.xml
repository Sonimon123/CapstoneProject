   <description>Friday, the second game in the Friedemann Friese Freitag-Project, is about Robinson Crusoe and Friday (Freitag). You play as Friday and must help Robinson Crusoe survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Friday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island and two pirate ships. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard will become a fight card and is added to the players deck. If failed the player will lose life tokens but also get the opportunity to remove played cards from their fight deck. Finally the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat two evil pirate ships allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 457)
Friday is a solo adventure - only you can win the game!
 
You are helping Robinson, who came ashore on your island, fight against many hazards. At the beginning, Robinson is not very skillful. With each fight he wins you will improve his abilities, but defeats are also helping to get rid off of his worse habits. However, life on the island is energy-sapping, so that Robinson not only gains experiences during his time there, but also starts aging and tends to get clumsy.
 
In this game, Robinson is represented as a card stack of different behaviors. You are forced to improve this card stack, so you can collect the cards at the end of the game to give Robinson the best chance to win against the tough pirates!

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO457)
Friday is a solo adventure - only you can win the game! You are helping Robinson, who came ashore on your island, fight against many hazards. At the beginning, Robinson is not very skillful. With each fight he wins you will improve his abilities, but defeats are also helping to get rid off of his worse habits. However, life on the island is energy-sapping, so that Robinson not only gains experiences during his time there, but also starts aging and tends to get clumsy. In this game, Robinson is represented as a card stack of different behaviors. You are forced to improve this card stack, so you can collect the cards at the end of the game to give Robinson the best chance to win against the tough pirates. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO457)
Friday is a solo adventure - only you can win the game! You are helping Robinson, who came ashore on your island, fight against many hazards. At the beginning, Robinson is not very skillful. With each fight he wins you will improve his abilities, but defeats are also helping to get rid off of his worse habits. However, life on the island is energy-sapping, so that Robinson not only gains experiences during his time there, but also starts aging and tends to get clumsy. In this game, Robinson is represented as a card stack of different behaviors. You are forced to improve this card stack, so you can collect the cards at the end of the game to give Robinson the best chance to win against the tough pirates.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO457)
Friday is a solo adventure - only you can win the game! You are helping Robinson, who came ashore on your island, fight against many hazards. At the beginning, Robinson is not very skillful. With each fight he wins you will improve his abilities, but defeats are also helping to get rid off of his worse habits. However, life on the island is energy-sapping, so that Robinson not only gains experiences during his time there, but also starts aging and tends to get clumsy. In this game, Robinson is represented as a card stack of different behaviors. You are forced to improve this card stack, so you can collect the cards at the end of the game to give Robinson the best chance to win against the tough pirates.</notes>

    <notes>RIO GRANDE GAMES (RIO457)
Friday is a solo adventure - only you can win the game! You are helping Robinson, who came ashore on your island, fight against many hazards. At the beginning, Robinson is not very skillful. With each fight he wins you will improve his abilities, but defeats are also helping to get rid off of his worse habits. However, life on the island is energy-sapping, so that Robinson not only gains experiences during his time there, but also starts aging and tends to get clumsy. In this game, Robinson is represented as a card stack of different behaviors. You are forced to improve this card stack, so you can collect the cards at the end of the game to give Robinson the best chance to win against the tough pirates.</notes>

    <notes>Played this little gem like crazy, but I kept him in pristine condition. More difficult than you would expect, this is a solitaire game set on a desert isle. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Friday_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; teaches Robinson to use strategy and a bit of luck to fight for his survival, then in the end an aged and battered Robbie must take on some blood-thirsty pirates with the last of his strength! Will ship in USPS flat rate box for $6.80. Thanks, take care,,,</notes>

    <notes>The game comes from a private collection (non-smoking and pet-free environment).
It has been opened and played a couple of times. All components are in excellent condition.
The box lid is still in its original shrink wrap for extra protection. It can be easily removed in case you find it unnecessary. I’m simply very picky about game condition and like to give my games this extra protection :)
