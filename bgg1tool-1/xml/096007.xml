Four factions have grown and their boundaries widened. The conflict is not to be averted. Blood will soon be shed. Mutants Union is the power that made rocks roll and attack, and the other factions responded quickly. The New Era begins, the era of war...
The New Era, a standalone expansion for 51st State, contains more than 80 new cards and a new, fifth faction – The Hegemony, a violent band of criminals. New rules for direct interaction allow players to invade each other and sign deals with opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; locations. New options and decisions have opened for players. The game is aggressive and even more engaging than 51st State.
The New Era is another Portal game in the postapocalyptic world of Neuroshima, a new piece of the award-winning series containing such titles as Neuroshima HEX, Neuroshima HEX: Babel 13, Neuroshima HEX: Duel, 51st State, Neuroshima RPG and Neuroshima Tactics (available only in Polish as of 2011). The New Era presents the highest standard of production with wooden components, a new victory points board, and polished and improved iconography.
The New Era can be combined with 51st State or played on its own as a standalone game.

    <notes>REBEL CENTRIUM GIER (RCG0009)
Four factions have grown and their boundaries widened. The conflict is not to be averted. Blood will soon be shed. Mutants Union is the power that made rocks roll and attack, and the other factions responded quickly. The New Era begins, the era of war... The New Era, a standalone expansion for 51st State, contains more than 80 new cards and a new, fifth faction - The Hegemony, a violent band of criminals. New rules for direct interaction allow players to invade each other and sign deals with opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; locations. New options and decisions have opened for players. The game is aggressive and even more engaging than 51st State. The New Era is another Portal game in the postapocalyptic world of Neuroshima, a new piece of the award-winning series containing such titles as Neuroshima HEX, Neuroshima HEX: Babel 13, Neuroshima HEX: Duel, 51st State, Neuroshima RPG and Neuroshima Tactics (available only in Polish as of 2011). The New Era presents the highest standard of production with wooden components, a new victory points board, and polished and improved iconography. The New Era can be combined with 51st State or played on its own as a standalone game. </notes>
