   <description>Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are ten missions in total, and each individual mission will take about 60-90 minutes. The box includes five game boards, four command lines (one for each player), four painted mech miniatures, ability and damage decks, a sand timer, a bomb-like-power source miniature, 6 metal trackers, 4 acrylic shards, 4 dice, and 100 minion miniatures.  There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Shipping from Dallas, TX.
Still in Shrink. Still in Riot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shipping box.
STORYTIME:
When Mechs VS Minions launched, I was one of the many who sat and constantly refreshed Riot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s site trying to order this game. Time after time, during various stages of the checking out, the site would crash and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have to start the checkout process again. After 4 hours, I finally was able to enter all my billing and shipping information successfully and clicked the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Place Order_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; button... only to have the site crash. AGAIN!
I hoped against that maybe it might have gone through. But after refreshing my email inbox a dozen times, no email confirmation came through. =(
While I was doing this, my girlfriend was also trying to order the game for me as well as a birthday gift to me. Eventually, she was able to succeed and got the coveted email confirmation! HUZZAH!
And then... minutes later... another email confirmation came in... in my inbox... from the order I placed that I thought had failed...
SO NOW I HAVE 2 AND AM LOOKING FOR A HOME FOR THE STRAGGLER!</notes>

    <notes>Played with friends over 2 weekends but the game feels a bit too repetitive for me. I read that shipment #2 of the first edition will be out shortly before Christmas. If this is too late for you because of vacation or other plans, I am hoping that this copy will be able to make your holidays a bit more magical. 
Thanks to Riot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s excellent component  quality, the game is in very good condition, and everything is complete. Unfortunately, some of the mission dossiers (up to #8) have been opened already, so obviously this is not a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; copy anymore.
Please note that shipping will be via USPS Priority Mail 2-Day and is estimated to cost an extra $30. That is, the total will be the *same* as if you ordered the game *new* from Riot Games.</notes>

    <notes>The game is of course in as new condition. The first mission packet is open (you would do this straight away!) the others are sealed. It would be much easier if the buyer could collect in person from Lichfield in Staffordshire as this is a big and heavy game! Otherwise I will send using collect plus economy with £100 insurance cover for £10 for UK shipping. If not collecting, payment by PayPal gift or bank transfer please.
I will ship to Europe and the cost will be approximately £19 with insurance for most major destinations. I can confirm the exact cost before purchase.</notes>

Ships from Falls Church, VA (22042) via lowest-cost insurable option of USPS, UPS, or FedEx, within 1 business day of receipt of payment. I have a mail scale and purchase postage digitally, so will provide you with exact shipping cost including discounts for online purchase of postage. I am able to offer local pickup on weekends in Arlington (infant + job limits my availability and travel options).
Note that this box is sizable, so will likely ship via UPS/FedEx.
This is a non-smoking home without pets, and I take great care to maintain my games, even those that are played heavily (this one has only been played 2/3 times, with the tutorial _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; first mission).</notes>

    <notes>Game has been played once, opening the very first starter mission_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s envelope (it was opened gently, not ripped).  The contents are in excellent shape, the lid of the box has a small crease in the corner which is how it arrived to me from Riot Games, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not very noticeable (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll post some images here later).  
The production value in this game is insane.</notes>

    <notes>This is from Wave I/Shipment II.  I have played the Tutorial and Mission 1-3 so those packets are opened.  Everything is in really excellent condition.  For whatever reason, the game just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t click with my kids and for some stupid reason, they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like co-op games.  They are too competitive I guess.  This is a first time sale for me on BGG.  I have 100% eBay feedback since 2000 and can share my username there if you need for reference.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing shipping would be at least $25 or so depending on how far you are from 98684 Zip code.  Please email me for any further details.  Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>Complete and in excellent condition. I have only listed it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; simply as all of the scenario envelopes have been opened - I can sort all of the contents back into them if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want spoilers. I have played through all of the scenarios and it is a fun game with a fair bit of replayability but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not going to be asked for enough by the family to warrant me storing something this size.
Will only post fully insured - not sure of the cost, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s way over 2Kg so likely that it will only be feasible via one of the couriers like Myhermes. Too big and heavy for international shipping - don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even ask - so UK only.

- Wave 1
- Top, undamaged Condition
- First 8 Envelopes are opened (since I played them), but I will pack everything back, so you can experience it like playing it for the first time
- I have put a colored sticker on the misprinted number of one the schematic cards (see picture). the sticker is copied from the other cards. The schematic cards are never shuffled and the backs do not need to be indistinguishable, so the sticker really isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t an issue. It simply corrects the errata.

    <notes>From Auction - For User fbi_boy
Please do not purchase if you are not this User.
Very good condition.  There was a box split on a corner when I got it, but I have repaired it so it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t split any more.
Components are in like new condition.  All envelopes will be repackaged so you can experience the game as they intended.
PLEASE NOTE: This is a pre-sale.  I have not completed the campaign yet, but I am currently playing through it.  When I complete the campaign, I will send the game out to you.  At the latest, I estimate the end of November, but it will most likely be earlier.
This is a very large and heavy box, so to make it easier on the shipping side of things for you, I WILL SHIP IN CANADA FOR $20.  I will absorb the rest of the cost.
If multiple games are purchased, I am willing to combine shipping. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This is one of the numbered first editions.  Ordered it on release day.  Really fun, extremely well produced game, with mechanics like a super-mega juiced up Robo Rally _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;movement programming_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; game, but a bit zanier and also more forgiving at the same time.  And I have to say it is QUITE satisfying mowing through gazillions of minions (so many in fact, that you increase _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;XP_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; per every 5 minions you kill.)    
The only problem is that we did not realize that it only plays up to four people.  Big drawback for our family and gaming group.  In fact, in the year or so that we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had it, it has only seen play through the first mission.     So, everything else is completely sealed.  (As you may know, each mission is sealed in a glued _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;dossier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; folder/envelope.)
The good: everything is in pristine condition on the inside.  And as I mentioned we only opened the first mission_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s envelope, which doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t spoil gameplay or surprise at all.
The bad:  two corners of the box cover got scuffed up pretty badly in transit.  Remarkably, the rest of the box is cosmetically untouched and so large and sturdy that it is hardly noticeable and structurally sound.  
Also: Head_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up on Shipping: THIS BABY IS A HEAVY (12.5 lbs) GAME</notes>

    <notes>4 (out of 10) of the secret mission briefings have been opened, but otherwise the game and contents are in excellent condition.
I normally ship with Collect+ in the UK, but happy to use alternatives on request, or arrange central London collection. It is a heavy box, so shipping outside of the UK will probably be really expensive!</notes>

    <notes>Alas, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got too many games, too little time _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; far too little shelf space, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling my new (out of shrink, yet never played) copy of Mechs v. Minions, wave 2. Game is pristine, save for a slight indentation along one edge (see picture).
SF Bay area sale preferred, as this is large _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; heavy box, so shipping estimate is high - roughly $45-55 insured within US.</notes>

The remainder of the envelopes are sealed.  Game is in like-new condition with all cards in perfect shape.  One minion is missing a tassel (came that way, Riot will send you a new one if you care).  Box is in great shape with nice crisp corners.

    <notes>This is a listing for a copy of Mechs vs Minions (1st edition). Cards are sleeved. The campaign has been played once with my wife. Everything has been reset and put in the right envelopes, all has been double-checked. Envelopes are no longer sealed but have been reshut with small pieces of scotch tape. All other components are pretty much intact, as well as the box and inserts! Notice I played this having in mind I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d sell it away when I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be over with the campaign.
Please contact me for shipping costs with your postal code, or for any other question.
Thanks!

    <notes>Game in like new condition.  It came from the company with no sand in the sand timer (we just use our phone timer).  Everything else is complete.  Only one or two of the early envelopes are open.
Shipping will be $30. 00 if it ends up being less I will be happy to refund the difference. (Its a large box and I want to make sure it is packed safely)</notes>
