   <description>On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;[1st edition]_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules. Soviet tank armies and German panzer corps spearhead constant attacks and counterattacks. With both sides able to attack, the game becomes a tense battle of skill and nerves._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Game Features:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    German Panzer Corps/Russian Tank Army capabilities_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Soviet massed artillery_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    German tactical proficiency_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    German Tiger tanks_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Soviet sappers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    air power_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    differing capabilities for Marshal Zhukov and General Manstein_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    and, Zone of Control Bonds_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COMPONENTS (1st edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    280 full-color counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    One 22x29_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheet and one 5x29_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; full-color mapsheet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    32-page Rule Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    2 full-color 11x17 Player Aid Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    1 8.5x11 Sequence of Play Card (w/ Historical Setup on the reverse side!)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Three 6-sided dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;[2nd Edition]The 2nd Edition has been re-designed to play much faster using the system used in France '40 and Normandy '44.

    <notes>Like new to new condition. Shrinkwrap pulled but everything is in like new to new (unpunched and unplayed) condition. Box has minor wear due to storage, but everything else is in printine, mint and like new to new condition.
From a smoke free home.
Buyers pay actual shipping (choice of shipping method), plus a couple of nickels and dimes to cover gas (I round up the postage to the nearest dollar and that is it).
If you read my marketplace comments/recommendation at BGG, you will know that I package my games with care. And I take time to package it good. So that it will arrive in mint condition.
Contact me by geekmail if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Please note that is game is Issue 60 of Command Magazine - Hobby Boardwalk Japan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s version of this GMT game (made under licence from GMT).  New, unpunched, arguably better map/counters than original version (no longer available and unlikely to make the cut as a P500 re-release).  Magazine in Japanese but rules/charts in English.  Mint condition.  Significant saving compared to the original</notes>

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT000615)
On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River. During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzer grenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th. Ukraine _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules. Soviet tank armies and German panzer corps spearhead constant attacks and counterattacks. With both sides able to attack, the game becomes a tense battle of skill and nerves. The 2nd Edition has been re-designed to play much faster using the system used in France _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;40 and Normandy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44. Players familiar with those games will find the new Ukraine _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;43 very easy to learn. All the components will be upgraded -- the counters will go from half-inch to 9/16 size, the map will be enlarged so the hexes can accommodate the larger counters, and each scenario will now come with a setup card to facilitate setting up the game.</notes>
