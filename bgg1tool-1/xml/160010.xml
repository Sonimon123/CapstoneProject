   <description>Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;gems_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;spent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; pool box to their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;available_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Overlord chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Overlord can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I will go to the post office and give an accurate cost for shipping.  Once that is received, I will mail it to you. (if you want it faster than the cheapest way, let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get a quote for that as well).  If you live in the Greater Seattle Area, you are more than welcome to schedule a meet and pick-up.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind driving to a neutral location.</notes>

I put like new because I opened the boxes to see what was all contained. Haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even played the game. Will ship in the two boxes with all packing materials. (add ons contained in box).
I would imagine shipping in the US will be around $25.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, played several times.  Not my cup of teach.  I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t save the plastic inserts because they barely fit the models and didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t protect them anyway (several were bent but I fixed them with the hot water cool water trick.  There are two big boxes so I will pack all the boards and bits in one box and then fill the other with all the models and shipping popcorn.  I will make sure to put the cards in a bag, the bits in several separate bags, and plastic wrap the outside of the boxes for protection and then use the same shipping box with the same protection that it came with.  The game is in minty condition but it is just not my cup of tea.  The box it shipped in is huge and ways over 22 pounds.  So shipping will be expensive.  This is the king pledge plus Vanir Valkyrie (Red Sonya) and The Black Dragons.  Buyer pays shipping costs of $25 which will include full insurance.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a Conan Kings Pledge, All of its regular and Exclusive Stretch Goals, [b]This includes over 230 miniatures[/b] as well as a ton of other regular and [b]EXCLUSIVE[/b] content. The game boxes have been removed from shrink to verify component integrity. The giant Kickstarter bonus content box (same size as the very big core game box) that is fulled with stretch goals has not been touched. The base game has been punched and played once, but there are ZERO condition issues! I am more than happy to provide pictures if requested.
Buyer pays for insured shipping. This will likely cost between $20 and $35 depending how far you are from Arizona. I will ship the cheapest way possible with insurance and I will only charge you my exact shipping cost. If I can get cheaper shipping than above, you will get it as well. Payment can be made via paypal, Amazon gift card, or in person with cash. Paypal funds should be sent without fees, so I do not incur double fees from both Paypal and BGG. If you do not wish to pay this way, please add $10 to your payment and send it through paypal as usual, with fees. If you have any questions or wish to offer a partial trade to help with the price, please contact me via geek mail. Thank you.</notes>

    <notes>King pledge + all expansions listed below (a lot). All consolidated into the two large boxes, miniatures stored in one box with a custom foamcore insert. All character boards laminated and corners rounded (look excellent). A few of the miniatures have the character name written on the underside of the base. 
Expansions included:
Baal-pteor
Black Dragons
Book of Set
Collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Box
Crossbowmen
Demon of the Earth
Giant Wolves
Khitai
Kushite Witch Hunters
Nordheim
Sabertooth Tiger
Stygia
The Legend of the Devil in Iron
Vanir Valkyrie
Yogah of Yag
Basically, everything released except the Dragon and the Black Ones. This is a TON of content.
The two boxes are large and heavy. I do still have (I believe) one expansion box in which I have the french components stored, which I can include (but postage cost will increase). Buyer pays postage from 53121.
GM with any questions.</notes>
