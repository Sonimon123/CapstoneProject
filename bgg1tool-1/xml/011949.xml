From the first Italian attempts to cross _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Wire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; through the Torch invasion, all aspects of the campaign for North Africa are covered including the Abyssinian Campaign of 1940-1941. Like the commanders of the day, you'll need to try and achieve your goals while events in other theaters influence your ability to maintain any semblance of a plan._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contents:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One mapsheet (approx 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;x32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 36-page booket with rules, designer notes, and scenarios; only 16 pages of actual game rules _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Two countersheets - one 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and one 5/8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mixed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 decks of 55 cards - one allied and one axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 player aid cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I bought this game based on hype/buzz, but could never find time to play it.  I have been the sole owner, stored in a smoke free environment.  I have opened the box and put card sleeves on the two decks (included in the sale) and the countersheets are unpunched.  I printed many of the extra play aids from the web and updated rulebook to get ready to play (also included in the sale), but could never push myself over the hump of finding time to play.  I am hoping this will find time on the game table for someone else.  </notes>

    <notes>Game is no longer in shrinkwrap.  However, the game is unpunched and unplayed.
All components accounted for.  Both cardboard counter sheets are still unpunched.  Map and player aids are in excellent condition.  Both card decks are still sealed.
I have one die instead of two dice, but dice usually aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a problem for wargamers.
Game box is in very good condition.  If you look closely (and depending on the light), one will see a scrape or two along the box top.
Game comes from non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>My late husband was an avid board game collector.  It is time for the games to find new homes, hopefully to someone who enjoys them as much as he did.  All his games are in excellent condition, he took very good care of them.   If he did play the games, no eating or drinking was allowed.  
Please feel free to ask any questions.   Thank you!</notes>
