Build the uniquely modular game map (using the PAKIT board game system) to your own advantage, thwarting the enemy's attempt to do the same._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Accept a random roster of heroic characters, each with radically different abilities. Discover a way to turn this diverse group into an effective team. To survive, your team must acquire strange and deadly equipment by confronting the illusionary guardians of the labyrinths. But through every minute of play, the enemy will be uncomfortably close, hounding your team as you hound theirs..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages Set 2: Intensity_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages Set 3: Vast Horizons_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages Set 4: Royal Tournament_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages Set 5: Mercenary Camp_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages Set 6: Field of Honor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages Set 7: Ruins of Cany XII_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages: Masters Addendum_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages: Prestige Pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Duel of Ages: Scrye Add-On Pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>THIS IS DUEL OF AGES SET 1 WORLDSPANNER AND 2 INTENSITY!!!!  I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell them seperately because I am too lazy to seperate the cards :).  They are in good but played condition.  Be aware, this is the first printing of Duel of Ages, so there is a bit of warpage in the boards (manufacturer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mistake).    </notes>

    <notes>Mint Condition Complete Set, NEVER PLAYED.  But this one is special - having been made READY TO PLAY right out of the box with MINIMAL SETUP TIME!  Not only have I _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;punched out_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; all of the pieces and bagged/sorted everything, I have purchased over 150 Card Protectors to use with the 144 characters.  Why?  Because I have personally, one character at a time, located their tiny _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;symbol_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that represents them on the game board and placed every symbol inside every character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card sleeve!  No more searching for 30 minutes for those tiny pieces!  Again, you can open these boxes and begin playing immediately.  I even found the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;upgraded_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; version of each character, from Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Addendum, and sleeved them and put the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;old versions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; away.  Everything fits easily into the 2 boxes that I have - Worldspanner and Vast Horizons.  This is the complete set that the manufacturer sells on E-Bay all the time, but mine comes ready to play with card protectors and theirs does not.  I purchased it about a month ago but will not get to play because we need the money more now.  To be clear, this is EVERYTHING in the Duel of Ages Universe - Sets 1-8 (8 meaning Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Adendum), the Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Adendum rulebook, the Scrye Pack and the Prestige Pack.  I think it comes out to 144 characters, more maps/caverns that you can imagine, and well over 300 equipment cards! The two boxes fit perfectly into the cardboard box I have them in, so they squeeze easily onto any shelf.  I can email photos upon request (or they can be viewed at _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;that other place_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; where it is for sale right now).  Feel free to ask me any questions you would like.  PAYPAL ONLY.  $10 shipping PRIORITY MAIL (really fast) to anywhere in the 48 states.  Thanks for your interest.</notes>

------------------------------------------------
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in the process of cleaning out the game cabinet. Look back for more deals later. For open and played games, expect prices below what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d pay at an online discounter.
Shipping: I will ship most games USPS Priority Mail using a flat rate box plus Shipping Confirmation - Estimated Actual Cost: $10.45. I will make every attempt to get you the cheapest and most timely shipping possible.
All games come from a non-smoking, careful environment. I hope you enjoy owning and playing these games as much as I have.
I accept Paypal or Money Order or Cashiers Check.
I do not accept personal checks because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship your game quickly with that payment method.
Currently only shipping to the U.S. If you are in a foreign country and really want one of these games, contact me and I will try to accommodate you - be aware that international shipping costs may be substantially higher.</notes>

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0 for shipping.
Yes, we will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog). In fact, if you buy enough the shipping costs will be FREE.
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address (this will expedite delivery) and let us know that the address you are providing is a business address.
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price).
If the receiver elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers:
Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) is the only acceptable form of payment.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, western union) payment. The non-discounted price (i.e. paypal payments) will be 3.0% plus 30 cents higher.

    <notes>This is the full kit, not just set one.  
Although I list this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played it five-or-less times, and kept VERY good care of it.  I would have listed it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but I want to make sure that when you get it, you get more than you expected.  
Set 1 - 7, the Scrye add-on pack, the Prestige add-on pack
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s addendum_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more, the add-on packs are both complete and playable.  I made photocopies of the cards onto cardstock; laminated layers of cardstock together and cut out the tokens.  All of the cards and keys are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;tuckboxes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;; other pieces are kept in plastic baggies.
One other _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;extra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is a collection of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;risers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for the tokens.  When reading a discussion of gameplay, someone suggested cutting a dowel into platforms and using _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;poster gum_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to stick the character tiles so they are more visible when playing.  Later that day, I noticed the little plastic cylinder in a pill bottle - just the right dimensions for the game.  Since then, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve collected quite a few of these little cylinders to use in the game.
I loved the idea of this game; unfortunately, nobody else I know really liked it, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather spend time with my wife than finding friends to play games with.  So...now that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got a better understanding of priorities, I might as well recoup some of my expenses.
I have all of the boxes, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if I kept the box _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;liners_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (you know the fold-up cardboard inserts?)  I keep all of the pieces in the set 1 box.

SHIPPING:
   USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>RESERVED FOR: OreCol02
This auction includes all of the following:
    * Duel of Ages Set 1 - Worldspanner
    * Duel of Ages Set 2 - Intensity
    * Duel of Ages Set 3 - Vast Horizons
    * Duel of Ages Set 4 - Royal Tournament
    * Duel of Ages Set 5 - Mercenary Camp
    * Duel of Ages Set 6 - Field of Honor
    * Duel of Ages Set 7 - Ruins of Cany XII
    * Duel of Ages: Masters Addendum
    * Duel of Ages - Prestige Pack
    * Duel of Ages - Scrye Add-On Pack
Not all of the original boxes are included.  Everything was condensed into the Masters Addendum and sets 4 and 7 boxes.  Everything present and accounted for with no damage to speak of.  Listed as very good and not like new only due to the missing boxes, which have long since been disposed.
I prefer paypal, but other arrangements for payment are possible if you geekmail me prior to adding the game to your cart and checking out.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere, but the buyer assumes all responsibility for shipping or post charges.  I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge you any more than it costs me to ship it.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing a bunch of games this month and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this professionally so please bear with me and be reasonable when it comes to shipping time.  If you purchase and pay Friday evening my time, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect the package to go out until Monday at the soonest.  I should be able to go to the post office for simple domestic shipping several times a week, but I probably will consolidate all overseas shipments to one weekly trip.
Check out my other games listed.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to offer multi-game order discounts and combined shipping, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not making it a rock-solid offer because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want someone getting $5 off each additional game and then buying 10 card games or something that would only sell for $5-$10 anyways.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to be generous to stir up sales, but not take a Net Loss on everything any more than I have to.
If you have any other questions or would like to request that I put up a particular game from my collection, Geekmail me with a reasonable offer.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m kinda making decisions as I go along through my collection, so I would probably be willing to sell a game I was on the fence about if I knew there was a guaranteed sale imminent.
Thanks!
Oh, and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re only interested in certain expansions, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to talk via geekmail about it, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather this all go in one bulk lot for the really reasonable price!

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling the entire out of print _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Duel of Ages_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; collection which includes sets 1-8 and the Prestige and Scrye packs. It has only been played once and has been stored in a smoke/ pet free house. Everything is included and in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition (exceptions noted below).
-Everything ships in the boxes for sets 1 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 3. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the boxes for the other sets.
-The rules for the individual sets are not included but it does come with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Masters Guide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which has all the rules collected in one convenient book.
-The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;platters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (map/board pieces) are slightly warped, which is a common problem with the very thin cardboard they used. I overcame this by using a sheet of plexiglass (not included). (pictured)
-I wrote the names of the characters on the backs of the character chits to make finding them easier. (pictured)
I ship to the United States only. Shipping is via USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. Payment through Paypal only. Buyer pays shipping cost.
Please check out the other games I am selling! I will combine shipping.

Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.

    <notes>Maybe the condition is very good.
I have The base set, Intensity, Vast Horizons, Fields of Honor, the Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Addendum and everything except for #5 Mercenary Camp and #6 Ruins of Cany.  I am pretty sure the Scrye pack is in there but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure, so pretend it isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t and you may get a surprise.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played this a few times and really like it, but you know how it goes. Everything has been combined into two boxes.  Make me an offer!
I will ship overseas but assume no responsibility once the package has been dropped off.

    <notes>Duel of Ages Set One. The game is UNPUNCHED and UNPLAYED! All terrain and character tiles are still in their original cardboard frames. The cards have been unwrapped but have never been used. 
Box has some wear, which is why I downgraded the condition to VG, but the game inside is Like New.</notes>

    <notes>FOR AUCTION WINNER _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;BURKS_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ONLY.
Game with all expansion sets 1-7 and Scrye addon pack in very good condition.  Includes new cards and tokens, as well as the update character cards from Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Addendum.  
Also includes a color printout of the Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Addendum rules, and various player aids (the rest of the MA is not included - I just have the important bits - the character _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; equipment cards and counters).
The character cards are sleeved and each also contains the token(s) for that character.  This really speeds setup!
Game will come in the original boxes for Sets 1-2.  The other boxes are not included.
A single character token has been replaced with a homemade one.  I made a color printout of the character icon and pasted it to a hex of cardboard taken from the frame from a map platter.  It is nearly indistinguishable from the original counter.
Shipping cost $16.85.

Auction Extract:
This auction is a mini-auction for a bundle of all of my Duel of Ages stuff.
The following items are included in the bundle:
* Duel of Ages Set 1: Worldspanner
* Duel of Ages Set 2: Intensity
* Duel of Ages Set 3: Vast Horizons
* Duel of Ages Set 4: Royal Tournament
* Duel of Ages Set 5: Mercenary Camp
* Duel of Ages Set 6: Field of Honor
* Duel of Ages Set 7: Ruins of Cany XII
The original packaging for Mercenary camp is missing.
I believe the game to be complete, but due to the sheer amount of content, I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t counted/verified everything. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible the odd chit is missing. If this is a deal breaker, please do not bid.
Items come from a smoke-free house. Boxes have wear. Game itself has been played maybe ~10 times. All cards have been bagged and chits stored in a plastic storage container. No returns are allowed and no refunds will be given.</notes>
