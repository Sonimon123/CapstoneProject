   <description>Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Villager Tool tokens_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lost Villagers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Swamp Villagers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Exclusive Stretch goals:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Creature Villagers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Quest Tokens_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Wooden Goods_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition exclusives_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>RED RAVEN GAMES (RVM009)
Explore a massive cavern and build your new village above and below ground in this storytelling/town-building mashup board game. Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back. Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface. With any luck, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.</notes>

    <notes>Hello, I have for sale a copy of Above and Below - this is the Kickstarter expanded edition.
The game tokens have been punched, but I have not had this game to the table and it is in perfect condition.
This game has beautiful art and looks very interesting and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sad to see it go but due to moving home I need to downsize my collection - and only my most played games are staying.
If you have any questions please ask!
Postage to the UK will be £5. VAT is included in the price.
European buyers please contact for a quote, this will probably be around £10 to £15. 
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>This is an intriguing and very entertaining game that combines worker placement and paragraph-based adventures to good effect. Players expand their village (Above), using the resources they find in the caves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Below_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. Along the way, players produce some great stories.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £27.50 (net of UK tax) - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country.
I charge shipping at cost, as follows.
  UK addresses: £7.70 (myHermes, takes 3 working days, tracked) 
  Other EU countries: £16.14 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Europe outside the EU: £13.45 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  Australasia: £21.50 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)
  USA, Canada _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; elsewhere: £19.75 (Air mail, takes 1 week or so, not tracked)</notes>

    <notes>RED RAVEN GAMES (RVM009)
Explore a massive cavern and build your new village above and below ground in this storytelling/town-building mashup board game. Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back. Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface. With any luck, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the Kickstarter version. I picked it up at GenCon 2016 on a whim but have never played. The box is opened and all boards have been punched and bagged. Includes the Expanded Edition components that are not available in the retail edition. You can email Red Raven games for a link to the downloadable pdf of the extra stories that go with the Expanded Edition.
See the kickstarter page for more information:

    <notes>This is the Expanded Edition available through the kickstarter. It includes the Underforest Tokens, Desert Labyrinth Tokens and the wooden goods. It also included the spiral bound adventure book for the Expanded Edition exclusive adventure stories that was available through the Red Raven Games kickstarter.
The game was played a few times​, but is in good condition. Photos available upon request.
I believe it will fit in a Flat Rate box which is about $13.50 for shipping. Local pickup available, just message me for details. PayPal and Google Wallet accepted.</notes>
