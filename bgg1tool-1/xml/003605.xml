   <description>The Third World War: Battle for Germany:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Third World War (subtitled Battle for Germany) is a game of the struggle for central Europe by the forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The divisions and independent regiments and brigades of fifteen nations battle in multi-impulse turns that feature NATO reserve movement and Pact echeloning. Air units represent groups of 100 aircraft of a specific type, each rated for air superiority, close support and strike capability._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The maps, scaled at 45 kilometers per hex, cover all of Germany and the surrounding area from Denmark to Yugoslavia and Italy, from France to Poland. Other games in this Third World War series, featuring constant scale and mateable maps, include Scandinavia (Arctic Front), the Balkans (Southern Front), and the Persian Gulf (Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is now a private sale to patton1138.  Musty. Box has significant creasing and warping. It will have to go with the other two in the series because it appears parts are intermixed between them. There is no way I can go through and make sure each makes its own box without going insane. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll leave that for a true war gamer.
The expectation is that the buyer will buy all three in the series and will make an offer for all three.  Nobody offering to buy just one will be accepted.  If someone places an order for all three at $100 that would be accepted.
I accept US Postal Money Orders only.

    <notes>Please do not buy this game if you are looking for a ready to play out of the box copy.
Unit ID and Errata sheets are not there.  I can provide copies.
80 Markers are missing.  If you have other copies of games in the series, they are interchanagable.  The neutral reaction chits are there, which is good, as they are critical to the game.
6 units are missing.  4 are the replacements for Southern Front.  2 are WP air units.  These can be readily recreated with the blanks and information on the geek.
Everything else is there.  Counters have been sorted and are in 16 baggies (GMT size).  Die, rules, four charts, maps, two empty counter trees, die.  Box is in good condition, top left is creased about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, structurally intact, no splits but wear is seen.

    <notes>half unpunched/unplayed, i.e. one countersheet is punched while the Soviet/Warsaw Pact sheet is unpunched and the half sheet of utility counters is unpunched. I seem to recall so many of the NATO et.al. sheet counters had come loose from their pane that I just excised them all and inventoried the entire sheet loose. Thus the components, maps and charts etc. are like new. And a very fine box too. Plus some articles for the series (I have some for the other 3 3rdWW series to add in plus BfG related. some variants too)</notes>

    <notes>Hi, I have an unpunched copy. never played. The only flaw is that is has NO game box. So, this copy is great if you want a replacement, a cheap way into the game or you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not too fussy.
Regardless, the game is unpunched and is highly rated. The game ships with tracking.</notes>

    <notes>This is for all 4 games in the TWW Series: The Third World War: Battle for Germany,  Southern Front, Arctic Front, and Persian Gulf.
All games have been punched and played by someone who took good care of his games, and range from Good to Very Good condition.
All four boxes are here; they all show normal shelf wear, and are completely intact – no split corners or tape.
Maps are all in Good or better condition, corners look to have been taped for joining, but there are no tears or sticky residue. In most cases the tape has been folded over the corners of the individual maps.
Counters have been neatly cut, and in some cases (the first three games) they are corner clipped. Counters show no excessive wear.
All of the rules and charts are here, a couple show some normal handling wear. Rules have been highlighted neatly, and sparingly. 
The Third World War: BfG,  Southern Front, and Arctic Front, were acquired as a three game set and the counters have been combined in two counter trays, by NATO v Warsaw Pact. Persian Gulf was acquired separately, to complete the set, and is complete unto itself.
This is a great opportunity to acquire this very playable series, and actually play it, instead of wondering if you should punch out the counters of a pristine copy.
I will insure the package, if requested, for an additional $5
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H of $12 is for US addresses only.
I am willing to ship worldwide if you are willing to pay the international shipping charges.

    <notes>Excellent condition. Box cover has minor dishing but nothing serious. The bad news is that over half the counters are missing. But, everything else is there and in great shape. Please see image for countersheets and other components.</notes>

    <notes>I realize that Compass is reprinting this series and that other probably different great new WW3 games are out.
Set is complete. Battle for Germany and Arctic Front are punched. Southern Front and Persian Gulf are unpunched. Replacement counters for AF and SF are transferred to those games. Although PG is unpunched, one counter is blemished. Also, there is a ding on the cover of PG, and all the boxes have wear.
Additionally, there are four extra counters and a Southern Front briefing book that are extra, and will be included with the set.
Shipping extra.
PayPal preferred for payment</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling just the base game, which is The Third World War. I played it once for about two turns, and that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s it. The game itself is in excellent shape.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve rounded the corners on the counters using my Oregon Laminations corner rounder (2.0mm), and they look great.
I will only ship to Canada and the US.
Shipping to Canada will be $15, and to the US $25.</notes>
