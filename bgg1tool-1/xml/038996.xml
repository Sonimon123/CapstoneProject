   <description>(from GMT's website:)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition. What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COMPONENTS:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * 2 Double-thick Counter Sheets_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * MOUNTED 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;x34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * 110 Event Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * 2 6-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * Rule Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * Play Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; * 2 Player Aid Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;PUBLISHED: 2010_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Mark Herman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DEVELOPER: Joel Toppen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Washington’s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War, like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.
Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy ofWe the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.
Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges adn not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.
The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In th end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War.
Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition. What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war.</notes>

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage will normally be by Royal Mail standard parcels within the UK unless otherwise agreed with a charge of £4.41 for this item. 
I am happy to post by Collect+ at £4.99. (see http://www.collectplus.co.uk/faqs) This service is good value and offers more flexibility on collection but make sure you understand what it is before opting for it!
There is the option of first class post and courier may be available for large orders.
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.
Barry

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT1002)
Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War, like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy ofWe the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges adn not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy. The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In th end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition. What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war. </notes>

Payment via PayPal, or cash for local pickup.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.

Components are pristine.  Box in excellent shape, no wearing (though one corner has _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ripples_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; that seem to be somewhat common on GMT boxes).
Shipping from 04011, USPS Priority unless other method is requested.  Game and packaging will be ~4 lbs.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT1002)
Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War, like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most war games, Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy. The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconventional force with a small Continental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War. Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition. What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war.</notes>

I cut the original shrink wrap and taped it inside (as shown in photos) to protect the box.
The item will be shipped within three days after confirmation of payment.
Shipping will cost $13.45 (USPS flat rate).
You can also pick up the item directly if you live in Detroit metro area.
The game has been kept in a pet-free, smoke-free home.

    <notes>Game is in great condition.  Looks like it might of been played once, but it is hard to tell.   All components are stored carefully in zip loc bags.
My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play all of the games, however if they were played they were gently played.  No food or drinks around his games!  No way, no how!!!  Stored in a smoke free environment.  He passed away in 2012, it is time to find a new home for his games. Thank you!</notes>

German edition.

All shipping is done via DHL. Shipping costs depend on size and weight of the parcel and destination.

    <notes>* This is a Like New copy of the 2010 English printing. Pieces have been punched and bagged (but cards are not sleeved), but remain unused (see the photo for more details). 
* I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a longtime BGG member who must seriously cull my collection. 
* If you live in the US, this item should fit into a USPS Priority Mail 2-Day™ Medium Size Box. 
* If you live outside the US, I will ship worldwide, but all shipping related expenses (as well as money transfer fees) will need to be paid by you, including tracking, if it is not already provided by that service. The price depends on your location and the service you choose. USPS is the default service I use, unless you select something different. This item weights approximately 4.5 pounds (boxed for delivery) and ships from Zip Code 20852 
* I usually ship twice a week--on Wednesdays and Saturdays. If needed faster, arrangements can be made by contacting me.
