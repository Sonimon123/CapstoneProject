Shipping is through USPS, $4.50, although I will certainly ship through UPS, Fed Ex or DHL for an slightly increased shipping fee.</notes>

And the Boy Sprouts are cashing in their secret Swiss bank account to smash the IRS! Two to six players compete to grab powerful groups and increase their wealth and power. No ploy is too devious, no stratagem too low, as you scheme your way to victory. 
Start your plot for world domination with Deluxe Illuminati. This new edition features full-color cards and improved money chits . . . but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the same game you know and fear, of secret conspiracies battling for world control.

    <notes>THIS ITEM CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED BY Stuart Middleton (goonahboy), AS HE WON IT IN A GEEKLIST AUCTION. (If you are not him, please do not try to buy this item.)
NOTE: This game is NOT complete and requires you to add components to be fully playable! (See the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Condition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; notes below.)
Why It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Cool: It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the original Deluxe Edition of Steve Jackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game of weird conspiracies vying to control and mess with the world. Get Weird with The Discordians. Fire up the Orbital Mind Control Lasers with the UFOs. Discover the secrets of fnord.
Condition: The box has a fair degree of wear, though none of the corners are split. The cards are actually in great shape; Excellent Condition, in fact. However, the money tokens are all missing and some sort of replacement (tokens or poker chips) would have to be made to play the game. This is one of the earlier versions of the Deluxe Edition - circa 1993. It features bridge-size cards with the original black-and-white artwork and plastic poker chips with denomination stickers (though, as I said, the tokens and stickers are missing from this copy).</notes>

    <notes>Steve Jackson Games (SJG 1305)
They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all around us. Secret conspiracies are everywhere, and where can you find the only truth? Certainly not in the game of Illuminati. Fnord.
The object of Illuminati is to take control of the world. The phone company is controlled by creatures from outer space. The Congressional Wives have taken over the Pentagon. And the Boy Sprouts are cashing in their secret Swiss bank account to smash the IRS!
Illuminati is a classic. It was an instant hit when it was first released in 1982 and won the Origins Award for Best Science Fiction Boardgame. It has been Steve Jackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s signature title ever since.
Two to six players compete to take control of groups ranging from the FBI and CIA to the Dentists, increasing their wealth and power for further takeovers, until one rules supreme. Every player has different victory conditions! No ploy is too devious, no stratagem too low, as you scheme your way to victory.</notes>

    <notes>Steve Jackson Games (SJG1305)
They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all around us. Secret conspiracies are everywhere, and where can you find the only truth? Certainly not in the game of Illuminati. Fnord. The object of Illuminati is to take control of the world. The phone company is controlled by creatures from outer space. The Congressional Wives have taken over the Pentagon. And the Boy Sprouts are cashing in their secret Swiss Bank Account to smash the IRS! Illuminati was an instant hit when it was released in 1982 and won the Origins Award for Best Science Fiction Boardgame. It has been Steve Jackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s signature title ever since. Two to six players compete to take control of groups ranging from the FBI and CIA to the Dentists, increasing their wealth and power for further takeovers, until one rules supreme. Every player has different victory conditions! No ploy is too devious, no stratagem too low, as you scheme your way to victory. </notes>

    <notes>I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know enough about Illuminati and its various expansions to be sure what is all in this box. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like what you get you can return it but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be on the hook for postage both ways.
This is the deluxe version of the game. The box, rules and cards are all in excellent condition. The cards are in a plastic tray which I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think came with the game.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s this edition: 1987: 9_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box with pink, black and white cards and cardboard money.
In addition to the components for that game, inside the box you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find:
The plastic box and small format cards and rulebook from the original game.
The rulebook for Expansion 1 and several sheets of uncut money. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m assuming the cards that came with the expansion are mixed in with the cards from the original game.
Expansion 2. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m assuming the cards that came with the expansion are mixed in with the cards from the original game. It does not have the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m Illuminated_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; button.
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also the plastic box and all components for Expansion 3 (everything unpunched/uncut).</notes>

If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>
