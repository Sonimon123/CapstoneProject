   <description>From Battleline, the original publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The grandeur and decadence of ancient Rome in your living room! Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battleline's Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by The Avalon Hill Game Co as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The condition is between Acceptable and Good.  All the pieces are present and bagged (including the 3 sesterces chits and the blank chit for each faction).  Some of the turn sheets have been used, but there is still most of the pad remaining.  The box is in decent shape.  There is some corner wear, and a tear along one side of the box, as well as wear on the front.  There is writing on the board (clarifying rules about Driver Lash Attack).  I have a copy and don’t need a second.  I will charge $10 for shipping to the continental U.S..  I’m willing to ship it outside the continental U.S., but will charge my cost plus $2. Also, to save shipping, check out my other games (here are some of them): Apples to Apples Junior 9+, Apples to Apples Junior!, Apples to Apples Expansion Set #1, Before I Kill You Mr. Bond, Bitin’ Off Hedz, Blink, Caesar and Cleopatra, Circus Maximus, Deadwood, Diplomacy (with wooden pieces), Gold Digger, Knights, Lord of the Rings – The Duel, Mamma Mia!, Manhattan, Modern Art, My Word!, Name Burst, Power Lunch, Red Empire, Seafarers of Catan, Settlers of Catan Card Game, Shipwrecked, Solarquest, Trailer Park Gods and Ultra-Warrior.</notes>

    <notes>An unplayed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 100% complete copy. The contents are in very good condition and look almost new. Although the picture shows the counter sheet being unpunched, about 12 of the pieces were loose and I placed them back in the sheet, so it cannot be considered unpunched.  The box has some shelf wear and a minor depression here and there, however it is solid with no split corners. The game does not come from the factory with the 3 six sided dice required for play, however I am including 3 new dice with the game.  View the pictures for details. 
Buyer to pay postage not to exceed the USPS Priority Mail Flat rate of $8.95. I will provide exact postage upon learning the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s zip code. I am willing to ship via USPS Priority Mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is least expensive or at the option of the buyer. International buyers need to contact me for rates.

    <notes>An unpunched and unplayed copy. The contents are in great shape. The counters are unpunched, the manual and charts are nice and clean. The box has some shelf wear and a ding on one corner but is rock solid with no split corners. (see pics) Strangely, the factory did not supply dice with this game but I will ship brand new dice along with the game so it will be ready for immediate play.

    <notes> Hi this is for a 1980 Avalon Hill version of Circus Maximus, the gamebox and cover show age and fading, bit torn of cover art, corners are split (except for one on top and bottom of box), game instruction in fair shape (few pages worked loose of staples), board still looks nice, has orginal copies of race log, one blank, and others with colors written on them, cover in plastic, with a china pencil, also photocopies of them. Game board in still nice shape, about 100 or so counters (six are lap counters of eggs and dolphines). The rest are colored coded of 8 of red, 12 for yellow, 12 for green, 11 for blue, 7 for pink, 12 for coco, 10 for brown, 13 for purple. Great classic game for those who want it/want it again, but, cannot pay for a new one/mint one.  P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is $13.00.
picture is a dramatization of a chariot race, not included in game (thanks to those great moterized sets on sale at e-bXy), check out race onlink.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYPwclh5yNM

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill flat box version. The game is complete. The box and contents have minimal wear, not quite Like New, certainly Very Good. In fact, for its age I would say it is excellent. Only a couple of sheets of the player pad are used. There are some additional player aids. It is the 10 colour version. All of the counters are present, with some colours having spares.
I will wrap the game in bubble-wrap and ship it in another box.</notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £9.50
Rest of World Postage: £17.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS:

PAYMENT METHODS:
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:

Box has minor wear along edges, no split corners and has small sticker on bottom right corner stating _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Circus maximus, Limited Run, Introductory Edition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  Not sure what this means as everything appears to be the same as the other copy I have that does not have this sticker on it.

    <notes>Condition - Opened and carefully punched but unplayed. Counters are clean, unworn, and with excellent like new appearance. Rulebook is clean, crisp, and appears free of yellowing. Full sheet of players logs included, in like new condition. Maps are in excellent, like new condition. Original Avalon Hill registration form included. Box has light shelf wear (mostly slight scuffing on the bottom corners), with excellent appearance and structural integrity.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup. For PayPal, the account MUST be a registered US address and MUST match the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s BGG Marketplace address.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.95 (small), $13.10 (medium), or $17.90 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
