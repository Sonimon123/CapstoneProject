   <description>Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only downgrading this to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; based on the condition of the box, which (typical of early Splotter Spellen boxes) was delivered to me with shelf rubbing marks around the edges and scuffed cover art.  Also, note that a frequent comment about this game are the warped boards, which mine also arrived with.  All of this is not horrible, but worth mentioning.  Photo available on request.

    <notes>Excellent Condition. English Version. One of the card board game piece is longer than the box. So, I cut it in half so that it fits in the box properly. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t impact game play.

    <notes>Punched and organized (comes with free small Plano case) but never played, pristine condition!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

One rule book is in English, there is also a German (I think) as well.

If I had only known back in 2005 when I bought/imported this from a German etailer how much these would eventually be selling for I would have bought an extra dozen copies!</notes>

This copy is brand new and never played.  If there had been shrinkwrap, it would still be sealed.  The board has no warping and the components are still in their original plastic.  Rules are in English.  The box is excellent too.  It comes from a smoke-free home.

    <notes>only for user: jehayward
Unpunched, unplayed, clean. 
Very light shelf wear on the box. Bits bag not inventoried but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the original owner and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never been opened.
Buyer to pay shipping and insurance to purchase price. $16.10 medium flat rate.
Do not send payment as gift or friends/family.
Paypal payment via goods/services as I will try to use paypal to ship the item to get the best shipping rate.</notes>

    <price currency='GBP'>270</price>
    <condition>new</condition>
    <notes>NOTE: £270 is a genuine price. Not open to underbids.
Bought new, played never, put away. Was not sold by Splotter in shrinkwrap. German edition, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to find the English rules.
Delivery will have to include insurance, tracking and a signature.
Can provide photos of my copy on request.
Scroll down and read the Signature message for latest info. Updated info will be in there.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html
Payment - read the Signature below for latest methods.
I now accept BANK TRANSFER - best for UK buyer if your bank has zero fees. For overseas buyer, I have my IBAN and suggest you look at https://transferwise.com/
Cheaper than Paypal, especially with their cross-border fees too.
Paypal, happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR, but either make it a Gift please or pay the extra fees. I have great feedback!!!
I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. 
REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN- Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail.
USA / CAN - As for Japan but I work out the cheapest method for you. Anything over 2kg or over 90cm in total three sides is difficult. Always ask me first.</notes>
