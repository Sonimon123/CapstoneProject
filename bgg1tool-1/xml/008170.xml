   <description>Players take the role of one fantasy hero traveling a hidden world, which is set up differently for every new game. Players gather mighty artifacts to solve their quests. The characters develop during the game, which brings some role-playing flair to the game. To help you feel comfortable with your character, you can even choose a gender by simply flipping the character card._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game has been compared to Magic Realm and Talisman, with a complexity somewhere between the two._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Other games in the series:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Under the Shadow of the Dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Helden in der Unterwelt (Heroes in the Underworld)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Return of the Heroes, English Edition from Pegasus Press.
Punched and played twice. The game and all pieces remain in gorgeous shape.
There is a small vertical crease in the box. I never even noticed it until measuring the game for shipping.
The game will be bubble-wrapped, cushioned and boxed. Buyer pays postage. 
Canada Post shipping is US $12 (C$14.80) from Victoria to Toronto or US $17.25 for Victoria to Dallas. E-mail me for other rates. Free local pick-up is okay.
Other folks have been very happy dealing with me. See my trade feedback here or my eBay feedback (yogurt-in-bc).
Enjoy the game!</notes>

Excellent condition.  The box shows minor scuffing and a very, very slight scratch on the top surface.  The components are in pristine condition.  Carefully inventoried:  the game is complete.  (This copy actually has 27, instead of 23 red stones, and 31, instead of 30 gold pieces.)
Domestic (U.S.) shipping will be the cost to ship a 5.5 lb package from 48104 to your location via either USPS Priority or FedEx. For other locations, please contact me for a shipping price.</notes>

    <notes>*Includes both the original game and Under the Shadow of the Dragon*
(Price is for both Return of the Heroes and Under the Shadow of the Dragon combined)
Both box tops have an outward bow.  The edges of the box bottom of the base game show very light wear.  The edges of the box bottom of Under the Shadow of the Dragon show wear and dirt.
The various rulebooks and glossaries are in very good condition, except for the condensed rules from the base game, which are in good condition (they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re a little crumpled). The various cardboard boards and pieces, wooden pieces, glass pieces, and oddball stuff (character stands, stones, dice, and bags) are in very good condition.
Please note that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m (separately) selling Return of the Heroes: Die Gralssuche, as well.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

SHIPPING:
   USA: $9.90 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.

One drawback, everything is here and accounted for except for the set of 23 red glass beads that are used to track hit points and the four small polished stones that come into play late in the game.  Proxies can easily be utilized for either item, the glass beads that are missing are of the standard sort.
Shipping is $9 to Eastern and Central US and $11 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>Return of the Heroes and the expansion Under the Shadow of the Dragon. 
Under the Shadow of the Dragon has no box (fits in with base set).
Missing 1 character stand, still 11 there which is way more than you need.
Missing 2 victory point counters, again since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s with the expansion there is still more than you will need.
Everything else there and in good shape, boss tiles have wear around the edges. The Orc Male has indentions on his character photo.
Shipping is $10. USA _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Paypal only. Would be willing to trade as well. </notes>

    <notes>Complete, open but unplayed.  This is the English version, Return of the Heroes.  
I am also selling the expansion, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Under the Shadow of the Dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately. 
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost. I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.

    <notes>Return of the Heroes 
Will only sell with Under the Shadow of the Dragon as a bundle. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve priced the games individually but you would need to purchase both through the marketplace. 
English Edition.
All contents are in excellent, as new condition. I only laid out the base game once and the expansion has never been played. 
Both games are now found in the USD box.
I still have the original RotH box bit it has two splits corners (received it like that when purchased new!) and I can also include it (might impact on postage charge though as parcel would be very voluminous!). The USD box, where all components are, has one corner slightly crumpled from new but otherwise only shows minor shelf wear. 
Postage to UK: £5 (collect+)
Postage to Europe: N/A - bundle is too heavy to make it affordable I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m afraid (you can always contact me if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re desperate to get an English ed. - 2 parcels would be needed).

    <notes>Condition - Punched but unplayed, box has very slight shelf wear. Components in excellent to near new condition.
Note - if purchased with the sequel Under the Shadow of the Dragon, will bulk lot sell the pair for $50.00 plus shipping.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
