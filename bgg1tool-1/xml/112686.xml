 Did you know that magical wizards are battling to the death ... and beyond ... right now!? _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Why battle?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; you might ask. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;What have I got to prove, magic man?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Only who_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the most awesomely powerful battle wizard in the entire realm, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what! As a Battle Wizard, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll put together up to three spell components to craft millions (okay, not really) of spell combos. Your spells might kick ass, or they could totally blow – it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to you to master the magic. You will unleash massive damage on the faces of your wizard rivals in a no-holds-barred, all-out burn-down to be the last Battle Wizard standing. And it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stop there! Powerful magic items bring on a whole new level of bloody carnage as you and your mighty wizard opponents tear each other limb from limb in an orgy of killing! Do you have what it takes to use epic spells in a war at Mt. Skullzfyre? Will YOU be the Ultimate Battle Wizard!?!
