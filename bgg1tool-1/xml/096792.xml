You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar's greed will net you a few coins? The Miller's wrath and the Monk's gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you'll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;So much to forgive, so little time.

Greed, Pride, Gluttony, Wrath, Luxury, Idleness, and Envy – the infamous _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Seven Deadly Sins_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. For the faithful, they instill horror. For you, on the other hand, they present a wonderful business opportunity!
In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins.

And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?

So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury?

Greed, Pride, Gluttony, Wrath, Luxury, Idleness, and Envy - the infamous _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Seven Deadly Sins_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. For the faithful, they instill horror. For you, on the other hand, they present a wonderful business opportunity! In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins. You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greed will net you a few coins? The Miller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wrath and the Monk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right? Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners! So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury? </notes>

    <notes>Brand new, factory sealed.
I will work to save you money on shipping: I use regional rate boxes that make it extremely cheap to ship within several states of me in Minnesota. I use parcel post when that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best.
Buying several games will SAVE YOU A TON OF MONEY on postage! Big packages work out to $2-3 per game (or less)!
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I take USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I now accept standard Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments under the following terms: The full amount of the Paypal fees (i.e. the fees I will be charged to receive your payment) will be added to your subtotal. Currently this is $0.30 + 2.9% of the full purchase price, INCLUDING the shipping.
I also am happy to take ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal Gift_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payment feature on Paypal is a little bit buried in the interface, since Paypal doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make any money off it if the buyer doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use a credit card and hence doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to encourage people to use it. Sending a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal Gift_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; does means you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be trusting your seller (i.e. me) and foregoing (so-called) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Paypal Buyer Protection_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, which is no different than the way every mail order transaction EVER worked prior to 1998 or so.
If you are not already aware, in order to make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal Gift_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; via Paypal, you must: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, click the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tab, select Gift and then make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees [and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see why sellers hate paypal fees so darn much].)</notes>

In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins. You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s greed will net you a few coins? The Miller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wrath and the Monk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right? Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners! So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury? </notes>

For you to succeed as a pardoner, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners! So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury? </notes>

    <notes>In the middle ages you could be forgiven for your sins by purchasing a pardon, usually in theform of an official (or official looking) document which promised that you would ot be held responsible for the sins committed here on earth. These pardons were sold by persons called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pardoners_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; not always legitimate representatives of the church.  In this game you are one of these con artists, preying on a group of pilgrims, all of which have plenty of reason to fear for their immortal souls. This is where the seven deadly sins come in. Each traveller is guilty of one of these sins and is anxious to be forgiven. However the player goes through the game collecting sins and getting pardons, buying relics, maybe dying, tempting each other to sin and collecting coins.</notes>
