   <description>Red Winter:  The Soviet Attack at Tolvaj_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;rvi, Finland, December 8-12, 1939_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It is the winter of 1939 and the Soviet Union has just declared war on Finland.  Bombers unleash a downpour of destruction on the Finnish capital of Helsinki. In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game utilizes many tried-and-true _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;classic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.  The design focuses foremost on playability, with low counter  density, concise rules, and sleek, simple mechanics that combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes.  This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.  And the illustrated examples make it easy to jump right into the action._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE: 90 Minute Game Turns _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE:  425 yards per hex _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE: mostly companies; some sections and platoons _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;PLAYERS: 1-2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;COMPLEXITY: Moderate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: 20 minutes to 12 hours, depending on scenario_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes. Red Winter is the first in a proposed series of games covering battles of the 1939 Russo-Finnish Winter War and World War II at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns. The Winter War games of the series will be characterized by highly fluid frontlines, wild flanking maneuvers by night, Finnish night raids, and a low unit density across a wide and shifting front. Future Winter War games in the works include the battle for Ägläjärvi, and WWII games in the works include Operation Dauntless (the Allied flank attack near Caen, France, in June of 1944), and several Pacific theatre battles of WWII. In Red Winter, players assume the roles of the Soviet and Finnish commanders during the unusual battle for Tolvajärvi, Finland, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Soviet tanks and heavy machine gun companies, mortars, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. The game map is populated by forest, suo (wetlands), small Finnish settlements, and a network of crude roads and trails. However, the dominant feature of the map is a system of sprawling, frozen lakes. Combat units can very often gain favorable positions by crossing these lakes, but they do so at considerable risk...Units caught out on the ice make very inviting targets! Based upon recent Finnish and Soviet sources, Red Winter is the product of several years of research and development. It was designed with an emphasis on speed, ease of play, and competitive play balance. The rules are built upon classic hex _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; counter wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, and sub-zero weather attrition losses. Low counter density and individually simple mechanics combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes. This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single, long afternoon. The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further enhance playability.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT1205)
A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes. Red Winter is the first in a proposed series of games covering battles of the 1939 Russo-Finnish Winter War and World War II at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns. The Winter War games of the series will be characterized by highly fluid frontlines, wild flanking maneuvers by night, Finnish night raids, and a low unit density across a wide and shifting front. Future Winter War games in the works include the battle for Ägläjärvi, and WWII games in the works include Operation Dauntless (the Allied flank attack near Caen, France, in June of 1944), and several Pacific theatre battles of WWII. In Red Winter, players assume the roles of the Soviet and Finnish commanders during the unusual battle for Tolvajärvi, Finland, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Soviet tanks and heavy machine gun companies, mortars, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. The game map is populated by forest, suo (wetlands), small Finnish settlements, and a network of crude roads and trails. However, the dominant feature of the map is a system of sprawling, frozen lakes. Combat units can very often gain favorable positions by crossing these lakes, but they do so at considerable risk...Units caught out on the ice make very inviting targets! Based upon recent Finnish and Soviet sources, Red Winter is the product of several years of research and development. It was designed with an emphasis on speed, ease of play, and competitive play balance. The rules are built upon classic hex _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; counter war game mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, and sub-zero weather attrition losses. Low counter density and individually simple mechanics combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes. This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single, long afternoon. The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further enhance playability. And the Play Book_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s illustrated examples make it easy to jump right into the action. </notes>

    <notes>This game won the Charles Roberts best WW2 wargame in 2012. There are some very impressive reviews on boardgamegeek.
The quality of the components is first class - including big counters and a fantastic snow covered map. The game has been played a couple of times but there is no wear and tear to the components. I will ship the game wrapped in bubble wrap inside a box for added protection. I have included a GMT counter tray to better store the counters - see photo.</notes>

    <notes>At the time I first bought this game, it was the best looking game I own (or traded away) from GMT.  Amazing Playbook. Simple but not simplistic.
Unfortunately, can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get it to the table anymore, so trading or selling it. Very Good condition, counters punched and put into GMT counter tray. Includes C3i  Ice Ball variant.
Shipping Priority Mail anywhere in USA $13.45; Northeast, $10.
Buy more of my games and pay only highest shipping cost.</notes>
