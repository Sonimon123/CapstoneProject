    <notes>Brand new copy of Z-Man Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; The Scepter of Zavandor. Game is brand new and still factory sealed.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing it in very good condition because there is a minor dent along the top edge which displaces the front of the box slightly resulting in a small bump on the cover.  I find it hardly noticeable, but I want to be as descriptive as possible about the condition.
Shipping will be $9.50 in the continental USA. Other locations please feel free to contact me and we can discuss shipping.
I will accept both checking and credit funded PayPal sources.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complex game for me to rate on condition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the German edition. The artifact cards and the shared central knowledge board have been pasted up meticulously. The cards have edge wear because it was played a fair bit when I first had it. The box has shelf wear. Essentially, this is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy of the game. The individual player boards are still in German, but trust me, if pasting them up was useful I would have done it, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s really not.
Payment accepted via Paypal, Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Check or Money Order. I ship to the US using USPS flat rate boxes for 10, elsewhere at cost, but I am forced to use airmail because the USPS does not own boats anymore. Airmail is expensive.</notes>

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>English Z-Man version. Opened, bagged nicely, played once.  Like new.
Will ship anywhere, but international bidders beware that shipping with tracking is at least $40 and probably more. Buyer pays full shipping cost. All of my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games are for sale as well, so if some of those interest you, let me know and we will negotiate a price.</notes>

    <notes>The contents of the game are new. 
Punched, inventoried, and bagged. The cards are still in their original shrink. 
However, the box has one crunched corner, as though it were stepped on (ding _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; dent). 
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way. I will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.</notes>

    <notes>I never actually got to play it so none of the components have been used. I did read through the instruction manual. So basically like new inside. The box is in pretty fine shape with minimal shelf wear. A little bit of flare when viewed from bottom as seen in the pics. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little damage on the right side of the front, a little crushed spot and you can see it in the closeup. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also a bit of a wrinkle in another spot, shown in the pic, but it may have been present at purchase. Let me know if you have any questions. I ship Priority mail from 28086. Or if you live in the Charlotte, NC area we can meet for delivery. Thanks for browsing.</notes>

    <notes>Game is unplayed. The game is actually up punched though many tiles have fallen out. The cards are still wrapped. Box bottom has small indent crease 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in size diagonally from a corner. Would possibly list the game as Like New if not for the very minor box damage.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been played several times. It is still in excellent condition overall, bordering on like new. The box lid has a noticeable crease in the lower left corner, which happened when it was shipped to me. Otherwise it is fine, no noticeable shelf wear, no tears.
Shipping $11.00, US only please</notes>

My husband was an avid gamer and board game collector. He passed away and now it is time for me to find new homes for all his games. He took excellent care of all the games, if they were played, no one was allowed to eat or drink while playing. The games have been stored in a smoke free environment. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>First German Edition.
Box has some wear. English rules in the form of printouts and player aids are included. Pasteups in English have been taped to the central board and all the artifact cards, which helps a ton in terms of understanding the game as an English speaker. (I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do the taping myself, I received this in a previous trade, and was very impressed with how nicely it had been done.)</notes>

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - The Scepter of Zavandor - has been played quite a lot (15 - 20 times, I think). Box has a few scuff marks (hence the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition) and all the pieces and boards are still in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition. I do take good care of my games :) ...
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/gideongrim ...</notes>
