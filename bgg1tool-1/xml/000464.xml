   <description>In the geometrical racing game Billabong, players maneuver teams of kangaroos jumping around a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;billabong_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;a dead-end channel extending from the stream of a river,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; a term used in Australia). The board is made up of checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On your turn, you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos. Jumps can be long; if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away, for example, the landing space will be five spaces beyond. The other option _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; to move a kangaroo just one space _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move. The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>One corner of box is dinged up.  That same corner of the lid is starting to split.  However, kangaroo meeples are all safe and sound.  From Franjos Spieleverlag.
Payment Notes:
Non-US buyers will have to pay via Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) (as it is the only way that I can assure that there will not be any funny business) unless you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks. You must also have zero negative BGG Marketplace feedbacks and zero negative BGG Trade feedbacks in which case I would be able to accept a Paypal payment. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
US buyers: USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks. You must also have zero negative BGG Marketplace feedbacks and zero negative BGG Trade feedbacks. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
If the receiver elects not to pay extra for insurance (totally up to you) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers: Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.</notes>

    <notes>I ordered my copy from overseas and in transit I believe it fell off the boat. The box was wet when I received it and the box was a mess. I later tossed the box, because it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really even resemble a box anymore. I put the contents which are in very good condition by the way, into a poster tube.
So, the contents are complete and in very good condition, but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have a box.</notes>

This is kind of a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;deluxe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; edition since it contains not only the regular kangaroos, but also pieces with printed on kangaroos (different colours though, but still quite convenient to mark which of the kangaroos already crossed the finishing line...).
Box shows little wear. Inside everything there in very good condition.</notes>
