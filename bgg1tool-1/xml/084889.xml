   <description>Integrates with Cave Evil: WARCULTS_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The living dug out cities for their dead: necropolises deep within the earth.  They filled the caverns with bodies and locked them away from the upper air.  Eventually the dead forgot the living--if any remain._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But in death, a new life began.   The breath of evil from the darkness of complete shadow stirred corrupted flesh.  In their middens and pits, the dead awakened, swarming through slime-fluxing tunnels, seeking chthonic power, warring with demons and denizens of the deep. Animated by the black flame, necro-ecologies rose and collapsed in the crypt-universe.  Now, cloistered undead lich-wizards have discovered the primordial opening to the shadow source, the doleful horror-hole where the Eternal Evil Emperor watches and waits...._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; The necromancers have dug their Lairs deep into the ground.  They must gather precious resources and body parts to assemble an army of minions, while defending their own lairs from the excavations and intrusions of others. In the end, the only route is into the demon path..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Then depletion of your essence leads to spending another eternity in foul sepulchral darkness awaiting the next Awakening of Death._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player takes the role of an ancient Necromancer.  Located deep within an earth, their Necropolises have now merged, each seeking the Darkest Pit, the location of all evil.  The dark wizards must build minions with precious resources from their Lairs to send forth and destroy, or dig further tunnels to locate other creatures, resources or to ambush another sorcerer._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is won when only one remaining Necromancer stands. A Necromancer can either be destroyed by combat, or an enemy minion may venture into their Lair and crush the wizard's shadow power, a Chthonic Crystal. BUT an even greater darkness may befall the players.  As they build and destroy creatures the Dark Pit absorbs the shadowflame and may awaken the ultimate Cave Evil._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Played three times. Box and all components are in outstanding condition except that one of the cards from the Abyss deck got creased a bit when I was shuffling. It is noticeable if the cards is on top of the draw deck, but otherwise not noticeable. There are about 350 cards in this game, so you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even see the card in most games.
Shipping costs within the U.S. will be $10. International shipping will vary by country.</notes>

1) some of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;player cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; in the game are a little warped. Purely a material/original publisher problem.
2) The previous owner tells me there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a tiny bit of scuffing on the box, and honestly, I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seen/noticed it yet.</notes>

Buyer is responsible for actual shipping from 37919 +/- insurance. This game can fit in a Medium priority flat rate box with room to pad, or I can ship it in something larger with even more padding. Buyer is also responsible for any PayPal fees that are incurred, so I would suggest using PayPal Friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Family which avoids fees!</notes>

    <notes>A copy of the 2nd edition with the extra mounting board.  
Received the game two years ago as a gift (thanks bro!), opened the box, checked the rulebook and decided it wasnt for me.  The box was put away and only reopened today to take pictures.   
The cards are still shrink wrapped and the tokens haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been punched.    There is some very light shelf wear ( some white scuff on one corner, see the picture of the side of the box). 
I will ship worldwide, buyer to pay actual shipping cost from Canada.</notes>

    <notes>2nd edition with updates. Includes the hard game board which was purchased extra. The game is punched but unplayed and in excellent condition. However, in my attempt to flatten the hard game board onto the table, I accidentally snapped it in half. It is, uh, not professional quality. However, it snapped neatly along the seam and is perfectly usable. It could be repaired with black tape along the backside, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll leave that for you to decide. On the plus side, it does now lie flat. :-)</notes>
