   <description>Outlive is a management/survival game in a post-apocalyptic universe in which nature has overcome its rights amongst the world of Men. In Outlive, players have six days (turns) to send heroes gathering resources during the day, while avoiding threats from other players and reinforce their settlements during the night, trying to recruit new survivors and adapt to the new world. The specifics: movements and resource gathering are compelled by your hero's strength._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You play six rounds (six days) that are divided between the day phase and the night phase.

    <notes>This is for the Kickstarter exclusive Heroes Pledge of Outlive from La Boite de Jeu. I have marked it as Like New condition having only been punched and played once, but there are three super minor flaws (all from packing and shipping I expect) - two on the box and one on the rulebook, please see the final three pictures for more details.
Shipping is to be paid by the buyer from 10024. This is a big and heavy box so I recommend using UPS Ground, but will use whatever shipping method you prefer. You can contact me beforehand for a shipping quote. 
Local NYC pickup is allowed and encouraged!

Please keep in mind that in order to be able to open the tight boxes I cut small holes into the sides of the lids for getting some grasp with your fingers. They are however not necessarily symmetrical or perfectly aligned (see pictures). I also painted the numbers on the orange minis and applyed an ink wash as well (as seen in the pictures). This was not done for the miniatures of the other players.
Shipping costs:
Austria: 6€ (or meet up in Vienna)
Germany: 15€
Rest of EU: 18€
Payment preferably via Bank transfer (IBAN). Paypal is possible, but if not done via _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;friends _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; include an extra 5€.</notes>

    <notes>Great game in great condition. Contains all of the Collectors Edition Goodies (Which are really nice!) It just does not get to the table as much as it should and I am hoping there is someone out there that wants to give it a good home.
Willing to ship to US only, buyer pays shipping (bit of a larger box so probably between $20 and $30.
also willing to look at trades!
Interested in:

    <notes>This is the kickstart edition with all the goodies minus the bigger board (this has the standard board).  This contains the plastic components, the nicer boards and buildings, the survivor miniatures, and the little boxes to store things in.  I have played the game a few times and have taken with me to game night a few times.  There is slight box scuffing on the corners.  All components are present and in very good condition.</notes>
