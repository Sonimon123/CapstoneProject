   <description>A Medieval game of trade and commerce, Die H_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;ndler is set in Europe, where trade wagons carry wares between six cities on the board. Essentially, players buy goods, load them onto wagons and send them for maximum profit in other cities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The whole game looks very inviting. The medieval cities depicted on the board, together with the player crests, cardboard coins, money pouches, sticker decorated wagons and wooden commodity pieces, immediately creates the right atmosphere for the players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are six cities - Paris, Cologne, Brugge, Gent, Vienna and Genoa - which are interconnected by roads. Three wagons carry goods from one city to another. No-one owns the wagons or controls any of them single-handedly, and in principle a player can put commodities on any transport. There are six different commodities - salt, iron, wine, silk, cloth and food - all of limited supply._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of the game is to make money by delivering goods to the towns, and use the money to buy increases in status.  The game ends after a certain number of deliveries have been made and the winner is the player with the highest level of status._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

This is a true GEM!! My only copy of this one. Hard to find!
All games come from a private collection (non-smoking environment)!

Buyer pays actual postage, so ask before buying to determine the weight of your desired games! 
The following payments are welcome:

    <notes>The game is rather heavy (1,700 gr). As the weight limit for a small parcel is 2,000 gr, there is not much room for a very solid packing (just wrapping in paper). The optional premium shipment is more expensive (but then allows for more game(s) to be added).</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game was opened and the pieces were punched and made ready for play, but the game has never been played.
So in all respects, this is a pristine copy in superb condition, and is new in all respects save that the shrink has been removed and the pieces punched.
Includes an English translation of the rules.

    <notes>Die Handler, 1999, Queen Games.  German version.
Contents are in very good condition: Clean, undamaged, bagged _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; banded, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; believed to be complete.  I purchased this through auction _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; was surprised when it was in German (which is the reason I am re-selling it).  It was sold to me as complete.  I have re-inventoried,and since the contents are in German, not sure what I have--all I know is that I have more components than what is listed on the bottom of the box.  
The box has normal shelf wear.
I have included a Quick Reference Rules in English by Michael Weston.  Other English translations online.
