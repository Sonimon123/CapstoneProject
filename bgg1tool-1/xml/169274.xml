   <description>Pixel Tactics is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Pixel Tactics Deluxe is a perfect place to start playing the game. This large box contains enough cards for two players, rules, punch tokens, and storage space for all the other Pixel Tactics games in print. Whether you're a veteran of the series, or just looking to get your feet wet, it's a great place to start._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All 25 heroes in Pixel Tactics Deluxe are brand new!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is everything that came with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tactician Pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge level from the Pixel Tactics Deluxe Kickstarter. It includes the Pixel Tactics Deluxe box, Pixel Tactics 5, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Pixel Tactics Deluxe Crossover Promo Pack,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Pixel Tactics Deluxe Holiday, Mythology, Historic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pack, which were stretch goals. Everything is in shrink. I also have 2 extra cards for Eric Summerer and Sam Healey (not in shrink) that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m throwing in.
Please note that three of the stretch goals -- the Black Ops, Sealed Secrets, and Final Frontier minipacks  -- have been packaged together as Pixel Tactics 5, so that is why the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tactician Pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed here includes Pixel Tactics 5. This decision was made after the Kickstarter ended, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not really explained on the KS page, but is somewhat explained on the BGG description for Pixel Tactics 5 and the February 3, 2015, update for the KS. Also, the copy I have does not include the mousepad-material playmat, which was included at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tactician Pack Deluxe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; level on the KS.
Shipping will be $13 if you buy this alone.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a big lot of Pixel Tactics games, direct from their KS campaign last year.
I have all the secondary boxes should you want them, but as of now, everything is stored in the beautiful storage box that was part of that campaign! This will help keep shipping costs lower, as well.
However, if you want the gutted small expansion boxes, I can include those, as well.
Everything is in Never Played shape and complete. 
The playmat is gorgeous!
Lot includes:
Pixel Tactics 
Pixel Tactics 2 
Pixel Tactics 3 
Pixel Tactics 4 
Pixel Tactics 5 
Pixel Tactics Deluxe 
Pixel Tactics: Argent University 
Pixel Tactics: Baenvier Marlgrove 
Pixel Tactics: Game Reviewer/Tom Vasel 
Pixel Tactics: Seven Sisters 
Pixel Tactics: The Price Of Victory 
Buyer to pay for shipping costs; Thanks for looking!</notes>

1 x Pixel Tactics Deluxe Promo Pack (Crossover _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Promo Hero Sets)
1 x Pixel Tactics 5
Everything is still shrinkwrapped and will be sent in the original box it came in. Kickstarter price was $35, retail is $50 for PT Deluxe and $15 for PT5, so you get a $20 discount.
It truly is a great game and I am keeping my original PT1 for the future, but simply have no space for the significantly larger Deluxe Box.</notes>
