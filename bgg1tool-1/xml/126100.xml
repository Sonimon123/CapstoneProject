   <description>Welcome to H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham in the 1920s. There will be many mysteries to uncover in this storytelling game of Lovecraftian terror. Using the provided newspaper, a list of allies, the directory of Arkham residents, and a map of Arkham, your job is to follow the clues from location to location, suspect to suspect, to unravel the mystery and answer the questions posed at the end of each scenario._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Your score in Mythos Tales depends upon the number of clues points you needed to visit, the risks you took to your sanity in your investigations, and your ability to find the correct answers to the questions. Match wits with Armitage, the man who has been exposed to the sanity-blasting truth about the existence of the age old evil! Can you beat his score?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With that in mind, it is time to collaborate with Armitage's investigations to complete your training. This is not a typical board game: No dice, no luck, but a challenge to your mental ability._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The cases that appear in print edition are:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 1 - A Grain of Evil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 2 - Flesh and Blood_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 3 - The King Cometh_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 4 - The Slumbering Solace_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 5 - The Serpent's Vengeance_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 6 - The Star of Tokelau_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 7 - The Vanished Girl_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Case 8 - Pasquel's Wager_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

This was an additional copy of the game I bought simply to have an extra copy of the directory, which is still in very good condition. Everything else was never taken out the box so is like new.
*Note this is the retail edition rather than the kickstarter edition so does NOT have the hardback book.
Paypal only so we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re both protected.
