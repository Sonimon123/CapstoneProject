   <description>This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on a map of central United States. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best.  Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game features private companies with special money-making capabilities and sizeable map which encourages most (if not all) share companies to become profitable.  A game is finished when the bank runs out of money, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game is brand new and has never been played. I only mark it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not in the shrink wrap. Everything, box and contents, is mint condition. Priced for quick sale. You pay the shipping, probably around $15 within North America. EMT is preferred, paypal accepted.</notes>

    <notes>Marked good because when originally purchased had a puncture through box top. Nothing to bad but it did look like a rod of some sort went through top causing a 1/4 to 1/2 inch hole.
Box has some heavy shelf wear around the sides.
Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have original tray or money.
All pieces are bagged in color coordinated bags for the tiles. Then the different stocks are wrapped with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hugo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Amazing tape_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which just sticks to itself and not the certificates.</notes>

    <notes>100% Complete-- I counted all cards and hexes to confirm completeness.  All game components in excellent condition.  The box is in very good condition with no split corners or dishing-- just edgewear and cornerwear-- the corners in particular are quite worn.
Buyer to pay shipping, actual shipping cost only-- we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll determine this based on game weight and zip code.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.  Note that one of the tokens was lost and has been replaced with a non-OEM part.
Paper money is not included (although if you need paper money, this title is probably not a good choice for you).  See my separate listing for poker chips if you need some.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>This game has been opened but never played. The contents are completely unused, all tokens still in their original sprues and unpunched. The box itself is in excellent condition, a small amount of shelf-wear but barely noticible.
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is £5 within the UK.</notes>
