Many things will try to stop them from terrifying and grotesque monsters to unexpected traps or events lurking secretly in the dungeons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For those wishing to expand their playing experience, the game continues through hazardous journeys where the Accursed must resolve player driven decisions which can prove fatal when the wrong choice is made. If they were to survive the journey, they would find a settlement where they can gather their strength, buy new equipment or participate in the many activities available such as jousting while building their own reputation to improve their standing with the locals._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Darklight: Memento Mori is a living experience within a dark, mysterious world full of deception and secrets._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>A new, in-hand copy of Darklight: Memento Mori Kickstarter Edition (full Accursed Pledge Level) including all stretch goals.
Please note: While this item is brand new, the shrink wrap of the core game was removed at the distribution center and it was repackaged, this was done with all Kickstarter copies of the game. I verified that the game box is indeed undamaged (Unlike many boxes which arrived with split corners or similar issues) but did not open the game itself. The 2 expansion boxes are shrinkwrapped.
This package will fall into the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;10kg shipping range of DHL.
(Addendum) To clarify, this listing includes:
The Core Game
The Adventurers Pack
The Exploration Pack</notes>

    <notes>What I paid:

Expansions:  $99.98 Euros
Shipping: $37.98 Euros
Total:  $286.96 Euros =  $366.11 USD
Up for sale is the new KS game Darklight Memento Mori, in hand here in Washington State.  I purchased this from a German retailer and paid to ship it to the states.  Then I found sealed copies of the Adventurer and Exploration packs on here from a fellow BGG member and purchased those and had them shipped over from Germany as well.  Ironically, after these 2 transactions I won an eBay auction for the same stuff plus the boss miniatures which I was really after.  Now I have 2 sets and obviously only need 1.  At $350 I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not even covering my costs due to the shipping costs from Germany.  Everything is brand new; expansions are sealed.  Base game is NOT sealed (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not sealed upon arrival, none are).
I can typically ship within 1 business day of payment, this will be rather expensive to ship due to weight and size but I kept the packaging from the previous shipper so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll arrive nicely padded safe and sound.</notes>

    <notes>Basisspiel. Sehr guter Zustand des Inhalts. Ich habe ein eigenes Sortiersystem aus Foamcore gebastelt, das es deutlich vereinfacht und beschleunigt das Spiel aufzubauen und anschließend wieder im Karton zu verpacken. 
Die Karten für Helden und Monster sind zum Schutz laminiert.

Bei PayPal-Zahlung entweder mit der Option Familie/Freunde ansonsten kommen PayPal-Gebühren noch mit drauf.</notes>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s opened, but everything is in great shape.
I will pay the shipping to the continental US.
The only thing I ask is a little patience with shipping.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a ginormous box and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the original one as I shipped a few games in it already.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship as fast as possible, but I will have to make sure I have a box big enough to do it safely.</notes>

    <notes>I have played this four times. It is absolutely amazing and the miniatures are out of this world good. I love everything about this game. It is literally an RPG in a box I could go on forever about this. Even in the four times I have played each time lasted quite a while leveling my character going to different towns and trying to up my rep to get bonuses and going on side quests and continuing on the main story when I felt like it or wanted better equipment. 
 Everything in box is in perfect condition and boxed up nice and neat. Your probably asking yourself, why if he loves it so much is he selling it? Good Question. I purchased this two weeks ago but since then our department got laid off and looking for new work.   This box is HEAVY!!! This is absolutly a steal for the price. THis is the Retail version however there are a TON of miniatures and i believe you can get some add-ons from their site.  Act quick im sure for this price it will be gone asap. Please keep in mind i only accept pay pal./</notes>
