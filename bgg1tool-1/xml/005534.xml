Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;strengths_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is played in two stages. In the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fast round_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;mining_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;scoring round_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; begins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; ships will fire, then all _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;mining_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of the asteroid._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Light Speed is part of the Hip Pocket Games series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Awards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    2004 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>My copy of this game has been played a few times, but is in great condition.  Some slight marks on one of the meteor cards, but this does not affect gameplay in any way.  I do not have the (flimsy and nearly unusable) original box.  If you buy this from me I will include a plastic card box to keep the game in.
SHIPPING: Once you provide me with your zip code (or country), I will charge you actual shipping cost from my location. Within the U.S., I can ship by Priority Mail (2 days) or Parcel Post (3-7 days), whichever you prefer. If you buy more than one game from me, I will be happy to combine shipping.
PAYMENT: I accept money orders, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks, and Paypal.</notes>

Light Speed is a lightning-fast card game of space combat about identical teams of spaceships dropping out of hyperspace to do battle over an extremely important asteroid. This game is fast: each round takes less than a minute to play! (With a few minutes to score.)
Tom Jolly, master game designer, brings us this fast-paced space combat game for 2-4 players. Each player has just 10 ships to play as quickly and strategically as he can. Once a player has run out of ships, the playing round ends and the shooting begins. Fast ships shoot first, big ships shoot last, and whoever scores the most points wins! A thrilling real-time card game in full color, a first for Hip Pocket games.</notes>

Light Speed is a lightning-fast card game of space combat about identical teams of spaceships dropping out of hyperspace to do battle over an extremely important asteroid. Each spaceship is equipped with 1 to 4 lasers, and the lasers have 3 different _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;strengths_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
The game is played in two stages. In the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fast round_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; players play their cards onto a table, trying to position them so that their laser beams will hit either the asteroid (and thereby _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;mining_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; it) or other players (causing them damage). Once one player has gotten rid of all of their cards, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;scoring round_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; begins.
In the Scoring round, all ships of the same rank will fire at the same time. (All _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ships will fire, then all _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; ships, etc.) If, after all the ships of the same rank have fired, a ship has more damage than it does Health, the ship is destroyed. Play continues through the ranks 1-10. Once all ships have fired, players receive 1 point for each point of health they took from their opponent, plus one point for each successful _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;mining_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of the asteroid.</notes>

==============================================
The games I am selling come from my personal collection. I often have bought games used or traded for them. I will do my best to accurately describe their condition. I 
will confirm completeness in most cases (unless stated otherwise) but not for items that come in large quantities for which a few missing will make no difference (like 
stacks of paper money for example). Please note that I am not concerned about inserts and may have removed them from a game that I felt didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them. I might not 
think to mention that in the description. If you are interested in the insert, please ask.
Note that our home is smoke-free but not pet-free. I can not guarantee the complete absence of cat hair in the boxes
I prefer to ship via USPS Priority. I use non-Flat Rate boxes unless it will save you money for me to use Flat Rate boxes. I buy the postage on-line and charge the 
exact cost to the buyer. I am happy to combine multiple items to save you on shipping
I have perfect feedback here on BGG. On ebay, where I am selling my record collection, I am ronattic, and have 100% positive feedback. So please buy with confidence.</notes>
