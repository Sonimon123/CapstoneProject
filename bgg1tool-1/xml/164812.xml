   <description>The previous edition of Roll For It! by Calliope Games was for 2-4 players, and two sets could be combined to allow play for up to 8 players. This Deluxe edition supports 2-8 players out of the box._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Roll For It! is a casual, family-friendly dice and card game. Each player starts the game with six dice of a single color, and three target cards are laid face-up on the table. Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of her dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of her dice from all cards.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If the player now fulfills the target with her dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; she claims the card, takes back her dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points. The first player to earn forty or more points wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping: (Standard or Registered Post)
Standard Post (Including 1.35 Euro packaging materials in price)
Ireland - 5.90
UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 7.35
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 7.35

UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe - 12.40
USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia - 12.40
Registered post everywhere else. 
Payment (In order of preference)
1) Bank Transfer - BIC/IBAN (Ireland, UK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Europe only) - Buyer pays transfer fees if any. (Free cross border BIC/IBAN bank transfers within EU countries as far as I know.)
2) PayPal - Select _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send money to friends and family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; option to bypass paying fees altogether, no PayPal buyer protection by doing this but you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need it. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always free to send money to friends and family when you use your PayPal Balance or Bank Account) If you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this for whatever reason then please add 5 percent of the total cost (Item + P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P) to cover fees. Or buyer pays fees as part of the normal PayPal process when paying for merchandise or services if you really want the payment protection. All my games are exactly as described and are usually posted next working day after payment is received. Any other issues will be swiftly resolved in a professional and courteous manner.
Combined postage for multiple items where possible. 
Combined P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P can result in higher shipping costs than for a single item due to different postage weight brackets but 9 times out of 10 it should still be less than shipping the items separately. On some occasions, depending on the items, only slightly less. If the combined items weight is less than 2 Kilo, item(s) will most likely be sent in the Packet weight bracket. If items can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be split into smaller packets then anything over 2 Kilos is a Registered Parcel and the P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P costs are considerably higher, usually starting between €40 and €45 and increasing in price as the weight increases for various destinations outside Ireland. PM me for further details if required.
All my games for sale come from a smoke and pet free environment.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Best of luck and enjoy if you buy.</notes>
