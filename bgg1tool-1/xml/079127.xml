   <description>Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Prime Universe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions.  Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;size._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players then _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;shuffle build_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s strategy for winning._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;trouble with tribbles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is unplayed and is in mint condition.
Bought new and unplayed.  Shrinkwrap removed and did component check.  All ships fine.  2 cardboard pieces missing.  Manufacturer was contacted and sent the pieces right out.
I only play games with my wife and she looked at the rules and decided she did not want to play.  Just not her type of game. So it has never been played.
PayPal only please, shipping in U.S. only.
Size of actual game box is large so what I ship it in is also large.  I checked with post office and Priority Mail is VERY expensive so I WILL SHIP IT PARCEL POST for $12.50 to anywhere in continental United States.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 60oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>This listing is for Star Trek Fleet Captains WITH BOTH the Romulan _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Dominion Expansions. They will not be split up! Only buyers interested in obtaining the whole kit-and-kaboodle are welcome.
All components are in like new condition (I even had WizKids replace the Sector Cards that came in the Romulan Expansion as they were damaged by being incorrectly forced into the spot for them in the insert) and the game has been fully combined (another reason why I will not separate them). This was only played TWICE!!!
Buyer pays for shipping and all PayPal Fees (if using the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money to Friends and Family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; feature of PayPal there will be no fees but if you want the Buyer Protections PayPal provides when using the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money for Goods and Services_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; then the PayPal fees are your responsibility as in the full cost plus shipping must hit my PayPal Account).

    <notes>There is a small issues with my copy: the dials for ISS Defiant and IKS Bortas are missing,  but you can track their stats straight on the ship card instead (see BGG for methods of doing so) which is actually simpler in general than clicking away. The 22 remaining ships are spotless.
As a result, the price is a bit lower than the other items on the geek market,</notes>

    <notes>HEROCLIX CONVERSION!  All the ships have been carefully replaced with the prepainted Heroclix versions of the sculpts, the original Fleet Captains dials remain. See pictures.  Other than that the game is unplayed. The original unpainted pieces are also included along with the Heroclix dials and cards. $10 shipping, it will likely cost up to $20 or more but I will pick up the balance.  See my listing for the Romulan Empire expansion with Heroclix ships as well, I will waive the  shipping charge if both are purchased. PM if you have questions.</notes>
