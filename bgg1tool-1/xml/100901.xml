   <description>The call comes in... _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;911, what is your emergency?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;  On the other end is a panicked response of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;FIRE!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Moments later you don the protective suits that will keep you alive, gather your equipment and rush to the scene of a blazing inferno. The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse, and lives are in danger._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You must succeed. You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you. This is what you do every day._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building.  Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.  The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a brand new pre-ordered copy of Flash Point. It is unplayed and unpunched. The shrink wrap has been removed only so that I could put the bonus materials into the box. Also included:
The Urban Structures expansion set.
The limited edition set of wooden rescue meeples.
Actual shipping rates will apply. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d estimate it at around $20 to the US. A bit less in Canada probably. Geekmail me for a quote.</notes>

    <notes>We have played this game twice, unfortunately it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t to my wife_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s taste, and as my main game playing is with her, I have to sell it.
All components are present and in the original game box.  
There is no wear, as we have only played 2 times, however, there are two things preventing it being _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;:
1) Naturally, the pieces have been pushed out of the card board die cut sheets.
2) The role cards are slightly dented in the top right corner (sadly this is how they were when we first opened the game).  I have included a close-up photo of this.
The price for second class postage in the UK is £5 (It is quite a heavy game, almost 1kg), I do not want to post the game abroad and I only accept payment by Paypal.
Thanks

The shipping options listed here are my „default“ shipping options. If you‘d like something special, geekmail me and we‘ll see what can be done.

    <notes>This game is in great condition, I put it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; becasue it does have very minor signs of play.  If you look at the pictures though, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see its nearly _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  If you are interested in it please send me your address and I will calculate shipping so you can make a single Paypal payment.  I will work quickly too!</notes>

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
International orders require insurance which is usually only $2-3 extra to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

You pay only the actual shipping, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred with no extra packing or handling fees. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

Item is in 45242, local pick-up is okay
By default I use USPS medium flat-rate, which is $13.60. Please add $13.60 to the purchase price when paying.
If USPS has a cheaper option (e.g. non-flat rate), I will use that and refund you the difference.
If you strongly prefer UPS or FedEx, I can ship that way. Upon payment of the $13.60, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get an estimate for your preferred carrier. If they are cheaper than or very close to that amount, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship it, and we can settle up the refund / overage on the back end. Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll let you know the higher cost, and I can either ship USPS or you can add the difference for your preferred carrier.</notes>
