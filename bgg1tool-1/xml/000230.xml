   <description>Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

* Initial inspection indicates that the game is complete. However, it will be re-inspected prior to shipping and deficiencies (if any) will be discussed with the buyer. The overall condition is probably GOOD, but the writing on the inside of the box top might make some feel otherwise.  Pictures of the games are included below.

MERCHANT OF VENUS: $119.95
Avalon Hill (1988)
* The condition of game is good to very good, though there is a crease on the box and a nick on the Nik card (see pictures below).  However, an inventory revealed only 391 (of 394) counters present.  All 14 of the big blue counters (see picture below) are present, so whatever is missing is not critical to game play.

    <notes>Merchant of Venus from Avalon Hill. Everything is here and in nice shape, gently played. Box is a bit beat up, with some compression to the lid, wear to the edges, some dinged corners, and a bit of the picture peeling away at the bottom of the lid (where _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Avalon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; from _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;The Avalon Hill Game Company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;) is printed.

    <notes>98% complete. All ships, deeds, pawns, and dice are present and in very good condition. Game board is also in very good condition. 
Of the 394 die-cut counters, 387 are present. Three of the missing counters are blanks; the other four missing counters are one blue Rastur 70, one Qussuth Fort (with a 60 on it; red/blue), one brown Goods (Immortal Grease; there should be six of these but only five are here), and one grey/blue Demand - Finest Dust. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how much the missing counters will affect game play.
About half the counters (mostly the small ones) are in very nice condition, looking hardly played. The other half of the counters (mostly the larger ones) are well-played with significant wear - not unreadable, but lots of whitening at the edges.
Original rules missing, but I will provide a copy. Box has moderate wear/scuffing. Box top has two split corners (upper left, lower right), and a small bump to top edge.
Shipped free in the US via UPS Ground or Priority Mail depending on where you live (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m more likely to use UPS the closer you are to Boston). Will ship internationally, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expensive; $40 via Priority Mail International. Paypal preferred; US Postal MO also accepted.</notes>

    <notes>This is NOT for a copy of Merchant of Venus. This is for the counter sheet with the variant counters from The General, vol. 26, No. 1. The magazine is included. I marked this as new for the sake of the counter sheet, since it is unpunched. The magazine is very good condition, but obviously thumbed through. 
Variants for Merchant of Venus include:
Fast Set-up rules
The Lost _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Box
Variable Nova Balls (who actually uses combat though?)
Own Species Bonus
Custom Spaceships
Haggling
Extra Forts
Agents, Bases, 2nd Ships, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Mercenaries (Where the new counters are extremely important!)
Also on the counter sheet are counters for the games Flight Leader _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Firepower.
The magazine also carries articles for Dark Emperor, Dinosaurs of the Lost World, Kingmaker, Statis-Pro Football, Stellar Conquest, Kremlin, Advanced Civilization, and ASL.
and for ASL completest in you there two scenarios:
Scenario P: The Road to Wiltz
Scenario O: The St. Goar Assault

Picked this up in a bookstore a while back, still in wrap.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve read the rules, but otherwise haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t used any of the contents.  Tough choice to give it up, but I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to play.  Hopefully it can find a better home.</notes>

Contains board, 4 dice, 6 pawns, 2 die-cut marker sheets (unpunched), sheet of ship cards, reference cards and deeds (unpunched), money, quick play instructions and manual. 100% complete and unused.

Components are in great shape, and appear sparingly played, if at all. The box is also in nice shape, with the exception of a small bump to the upper right corner, and some clear packing tape to each side (apparently used to keep the lid on at some point).
Shipping in the US will be $10. I am willing to ship outside the US via Priority Mail International at cost; please contact me for an estimate.
I accept Paypal (shipping to confirmed addresses only), as well as check/money order. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to answer any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Merchant of Venus (1988) by Avalon Hill
Box:  Minimal shelfwear with one damaged corner.  The lower left corner of the box top looks like it had too much weight put on it, resulting in slight bowing of the left side and bottom, a split corner, and a 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; paper tear along the lower left edge of the box top.  Aside from this, box is in outstanding condition!
Components:  Complete and partially unpunched!  Game looks like it has never been played.  Many of the chits are stuck together with other chits, and three colors of ships have not been separated.  All components are crisp and unworn.  The pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged. 
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.

    <notes>Game is in very good condition, with very mild shelf wear/fading on the box and board.
All counter sheets are UNPUNCHED!
I have verified that the game is complete, but I suspect that the included player pawns (and possibly the dice) are not the originals, because they do not match the player colors.

    <notes>Box color very crisp and box in very good condition.  Game materials are in very good condition as well.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve reviewed the game materials and they appear to all be present but I have not meticulously inventoried they are present (see note below).  Chits are organized into trays.
Shipping will be $9 to Easter and Central US and $11 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations please inquire.
Note:  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game on behalf of a friend whose father recently passed and who had a remarkable collection of games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting in coming weeks.  There are too many games in this collection for me to meticulously inventory beyond just a basic review but I have no reason to expect any problems with these games as I personally know they have been very well cared for the last 20+ years (generally all the games in this collection are lightly played).  Other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting from this collection include:  Outpost, Magic Realm, Divine Right, Gunslinger, Merchant of Venus, The Lonely Mountain, Sword and Sorcery, Talisman, and nearly 30 others so please ask if there is something else you are looking for from this era as I might actually have it.</notes>

    <notes>This is a copy I bought to use, but before it arrived I found a deal on a used copy that I use to play with that is complete. I am not much of a collector of things which is why this is up for sale. Comes from a smoke free, pet free, kid free, other wise hazard free home. You can see from the pictures the bottom on the corners has slight wear from age and the shrink is coming up on one side just a touch, but you can see the box is undamaged. Please take a look at the pictures. Thanks!</notes>

This is a perfect gift for the holidays.
Will ship via UPS ground with appropriate insurance. Would also ship via USPS with delivery confirmation and insurance.  Will package very well, with a box inside a box and plenty of packing peanuts.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m estimating that packaged weight for the item will be around 5 pounds, but a final weight and actual shipping cost will be provided after purchase.  Ships from 53597.
Payment via PayPal, USD only.  Shipping only to address associated with PayPal account.
Thanks for looking.

The game is complete, and the only thing that isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t original to the edition are the dice.  I added some after I purchased it, and they will be standard, white d6s.  I have lots of dice, though, so if you prefer a different color, let me know.</notes>

    <notes>This is the first edition and probably one of the oldest games in my collection. I have not been playing this for a very long time due to all the new games that have been coming out over the last years.
It is complete but has seen heavy play. It is fair to say that it is in acceptable to good condition (depending on the parts you are looking at).
Item can be shipped to Switzerland (from within Switzerland) or to any other European country. In the latter case I´d be able to ship the game from Germany, as this would save quite a lot on shipping costs and time (+ potentially on customs).</notes>
