The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;bulge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in the American line._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Bulge enthusiast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and the casual player will enjoy. German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself). The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt. Likewise, the German player has an equal chance of changing history and reaching the Meuse River._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE: 12 hours per turn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE: 1.6 miles per hex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE: Regimental-level including battalions for tank units and some infantry battalions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: One or two_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SPECIAL FEATURES: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Night Turns _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Tank Destroyers _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Weather _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Air Supply _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Determined Attack/Defense Options _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Traffic Jams _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roadblocks _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Bridge Demolition/Construction _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Disengagement _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Armor ratings _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Corps level artillery _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;von Der Heydte's parachute battalion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;raquo;Skorzeny's 150th Panzer Brigade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DESIGNER: Mark Simonitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;DEVELOPER: Tony Curtis_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP ART _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Never played. Newer version of the rules have been printed and included. Updated counters have replaced incorrect counters in the counter sheet.  Looks pretty good for a 16 year old game. Hate to sell, but no more space.</notes>

    <notes>Parting with my copy to make room for new games.  This beautiful game comes from a game-loving, non-smoker home (no musty smell).  It is the latest second edition.  It is punched, but it has never been played.  The maps have never been played on.  The rulebook is crisp and unmarked.  Includes three Plano trays for counter storage.  I will also include a xeroxed copy of the rules (I print out the rules to save wear and tear on the original).  It is truly like-new game.
I have been a BGG member for years, but never sold on BGG.  You can see my buyer/seller feedback on ebay, seller ID _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;houlie63_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  If seriously interested, I will gladly send photos of the exact item for sale.   Looks like that isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t an option here.
Buyer pays shipping.  Your game will be carefully packaged and sent via USPS priority mail medium flat rate box.  This method includes tracking information so you can track progress to your destination.  Reach out to me if you require a different shipping method.  Please reach out with any questions prior to purchase.  Thanks for looking.</notes>
