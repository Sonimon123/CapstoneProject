    <notes>This is to buy out my kickstarter pledge. I will change the shipping address to yours and you will receive the kickstarter core box (with all stretch goals, but no add-ons).
WETA is estimating shipping cost at $35. If it turns out to be less, you will pay actual. If it turns out to be more, we will split the difference.</notes>

    <notes>This game is new and sealed from Kickstarter. It includes:
GKR: Heavy Hitters Core Game
GKR: Heavy Hitters Stretch Goals w/ Kickstarter Exclusives
Big Little Buddy (Add-On)
Urban Wasteland Expansion (Add-On)
Themed Defense Dice (Add-On)
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>

    <notes>Only played 2 times- our gaming group loved it but games tended to take too long with 4 players for it to be a regular game we would play.  Shipping is kinda high given the size/weight of the box so keep that in mind.  This is the standard edition, retails for $149.  Thanks!</notes>
