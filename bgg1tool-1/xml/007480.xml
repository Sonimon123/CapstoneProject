It uses the popular base system invented by Mark Herman and featured in Ted Raicer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Paths of Glory. This time, event cards and point-to-point maneuver enable up to four players to recreate the vicious struggles among the peoples of Italy and Sicily in 4th and 3rd Centuries BC. Who will dominate the western Mediterranean_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;and with it earn the right to vie for control of the known world?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Sword of Rome includes rules and events for city loyalty, Roman colonies, tribal raids, Gallic indiscipline, Greek siege craft, Indian war elephants, Roman and Macedonian-style infantry tactics, the mountain fastness of Samnium, and much, much more. The game covers over 100 years of classical history in just 9 hands of cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The interplay of each power_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s special strengths, of the strategy decks_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; 152 event cards, and of up to four players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; diplomatic acumen provides unlimited variety.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 0405)
Rome began the 4th century BC as no more than the leading city of a small league of Latin communities and ended it controlling all of Italy and on the doorstep to Western preeminence.
The Sword of Rome is the latest in GMT Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; acclaimed line of Card-Driven Games (CDG). The game enables up to four players to recreate the climatic struggles among the peoples of Italy and Sicily, Romans, or Gauls will dominate the western Mediterranean and with it earn the right to vie for control of the known world?
Through a unique adaptation of the event-card system, players can also take on the roles of additional contenders such as Gallic tribes from across the Alps or the mighty naval power of Carthage. You will command the great figures of the age: Rome_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s military savior Marcus Furius Camillus; Syracusan tyrant Agathocles, who dared to assault Carthage itself; or Pyrrhus of Epirus, the adventurer king who sought to unite the western Greeks.
Each player has their own customized deck of strategy cards containing a total of 152 events that lend specific flavor and personality to the different factions. Additionally, each faction also has special powers that emphasize its historic strengths
The Romans can create new colonies, improving the defense of their budding empire and increasing their manpower through diplomatic assimilation of the local peoples.
  
The Etruscans may utilize their great wealth to bribe greedy foreign leaders to avoid battles they would rather not have to fight, while the Samnites can use the paths among their mountain homelands against invading enemies.
  
The Greeks have outstanding mercenary forces at their disposal, but at the cost of diminishing loyalty of their colonies as their generals seek to establish their own little kingdoms
  
The Gauls can move swiftly and claim victory in unexpected ways while raiding and plundering their enemies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; strongholds. 
Two, three, or four players may test their diplomatic and military acumen in this game that combines the familiar strategy card driven system originally created by Mark Herman, with a number of innovative new twists.

This is the original 2004 edition (ie, not the 2010 deluxe princely edition with the super-duper map and extra double-thick counters); this does, however, include the 5th player expansion module.
CONUS shipping is USPS cheapest of priority or flat rate from zip 12572, figure a 4-pound package. Check out USPS.com for international shipping. I will add $1-2 to shipping to cover BGG and paypal fees.</notes>

    <notes>This is the 2010 Edition.
Condition: Complete game (no missing pieces). All components in good condition. Rules most likely will have handwritten clarifications on them.
Game price and Shipping cost depends on the 3 regions.
If you are in Canada, game price is in Canadian $ and shipping is 20 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, game price is in US $ and shipping is 30 US$.
If you are in EU, game price is in Euros and shipping is 80 Euros.
Shipping is the same for multiple items.
Payment: PayPal only.
My Paypal username is :
pnomikos@cogeco.ca
If you are in Canada, you pay in CDN$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in the USA, you pay in US$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in EU, you pay in Euros (game price and shipping).
Example:
The price of the game is 10$.
If you are in Canada, your total cost is 10+20=30 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, your total cost is 10+30=40 US$.
If you are in EU, your total cost is 10+80=90 Euros.</notes>
