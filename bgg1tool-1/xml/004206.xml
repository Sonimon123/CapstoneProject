   <description>This is the third game in the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. It covers the battle of Gettysburg._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(from the back of the box)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Roads to Gettysburg is the third volume in Avalon Hill's series on the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War. Unlike most Civil War simulations, which portray specific battles, Roads to Gettysburg concentrates on the entire three-week campaign that led to the great struggle at Gettysburg. The Union player's objective is to defeat the Rebel army and push it back to Virginia. The goal of the Confederate player is to maintain control over the rich agricultural regions of Pennsylvania._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Roads to Gettysburg is easy to learn and several scenarios can be played to completion in about an hour. The two beautiful game maps, which are based on original Civil War period maps in state and county archives, portray Maryland and Pennsylvania as they were in the summer of 1863, including roads, turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains, cities, and villages. In the game, players control Union and Confederate military units in turns representing one day of real time. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game's interactive system of play assures that each scenario will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive. An extensive historical article, detailing the day-to-day activities of the actual campaign, is included in the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You do not need to own Stonewall Jackson's Way or Here Come the Rebels! to play Roads to Gettysburg._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: Owners of those games can join their maps to the Roads to Gettysburg maps to portray the eastern theatre of the Civil War from Fredericksburg, Virginia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;CONTENTS: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Counter Sheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;x32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Mapsheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Rules Booklet _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Charts and Tables Card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Display Cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Ammunition Pad _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 6-Sided Dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Counter Tray_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Time Scale: One day per turn _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Map Scale: One mile per hex _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unit Scale: Divisions and brigades (with corps leaders) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players: One, two, or teams _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Playing Time: One hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 14 hours for other scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping weight is 2lb. Due to the high value of this game, cost for insurance and delivery confirmation has been added to the shipping cost inside the US. You are free to waive these costs, but the buyer will then absorb these risks (which are, admittedly, quite low).</notes>

    <notes>Finally I have a copy of Roads to Gettysburg by Avalon Hill.
This is part of the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. The map is gorgeous with no detail spared. The game is like new. It covers the entire build up to the battle of Gettysburg at the division level. Some brigades and regiments are also represented. the map includes Gettysburg in the center all the way down to Harpers Ferry and Sharpsburg in the South and Harrisburg in the North. I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say enough about how great this map looks! One of the best I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ever seen in a wargame. This game is listed for $180.00
Reviews and info for all of these games including suggested prices can be found at boardgamegeeks.com.
I am doing some Fall cleaning and want to pass these on to someone who will get more use out of them than I have over the past few years. I am interested in cash or trades or combinations of both.</notes>

    <notes>Like new to new condition. Shrinkwrap pulled off only to inspect content, everything is in like new to new (unpunched and unplayed) condition. Box looks new too (The whole package looks like it is recently opened).
From a smoke free home.
Buyers pay actual shipping (choice of shipping method), plus a couple of nickels and dimes to cover gas (I round up the postage to the nearest dollar and that is it).
If you read my marketplace comments/recommendation at BGG, you will know that I package my games with care. And I take time to package it good. So that it will arrive in mint condition.
Contact me by geekmail if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Three games for one price: Stonewall in the Valley and Stonewall_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s last Battle are part of the bundle.  Roads to Gettysburg includes both updated(MMP) and original counters. All parts for the original games are included plus updated counters for Roads to Gettysburg and a photo copy of the updated rules set for the series.  All three games will ship together for one price. The RTG map has had the edges trimmed to fit with other maps in the series, but all sections, including information and charts, are in the box.  Each game has a counter tray--fatigue markers, etc. in RTG box. These games have been played and enjoyed--and are ready for the table tonight. Email me if you have questions.   </notes>

    <notes>Counters are 100% unpunched and all components are complete (maps, rules, player mats, counter tray, dice, etc.). Game is essentially like new, never played.  The box is in great condition.  There is some very minor wear at a few of the corners and the lid bows out a bit at the top, but overall I would rate it at least 8.5/10.
Price includes priority shipping to US.</notes>
