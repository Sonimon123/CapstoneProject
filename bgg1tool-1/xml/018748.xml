   <description>Unhappy King Charles! allows two players to decide whether Commons or Cavalier shall rule in England. Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman's ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map; the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game's basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region's Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit's region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General's Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For those players who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided.

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT 0814)
In the autumn of 1642 the long foreshadowed clash between the English Parliament and the supporters of the Royal Prerogative was brought to a head. At Nottingham, before a generally uninterested audience, King Charles I (the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Man of Blood_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) raised the Royal Standard indicating all who took the field against him were traitors and rebels. Parliament sought to defeat the King militarily (or rather the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s evil counsellors for we are His Majesty_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s most faithful servants) so as to overturn the Royal Prerogative in matters of tax and defence. In so doing it had the support of by far the majority of the aristocracy, the merchant class and the anti-papists. The King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s aim was to defeat Parliament and establish his control of funding so as to permit the full flowering of his (he thought) divinely sanctioned powers. Into this heady brew came Papists (seeking freedom of religion), Protestant sectaries, rebellious Irish nobles, Scots Presbyterians (fresh from victory in the Bishop_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Wars) and many other parties. Fortunately for England, the great nations of Europe were otherwise engaged.
Unhappy King Charles! allows two players to decide whether Commons or Cavalier shall rule in England. Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.
The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organisation of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards-Red (1642-1643), Blue (1644) and Black (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.
Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map, the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps.
The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax.
Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle.
The game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available.
Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals.
Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards.
Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses).
The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, the play of a Treaty Card, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn.
For those of you who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided. Now you can use Dutch squadrons to blockade the King, summon the Duke of Lorraine, or cause a rising in London. As an Optional Rule, four events are drawn each game and shuffled into the middle and late decks.

I used a labelmaker to mark blank counters and modify some of the smaller counters. For those who don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like pimping, I added a fresh unused game map and an extra 1/2 counter sheet.
Housekeeping: The following markers are added for various game statuses:
5 extra Political Control markers: These are placed on the Key as needed to note Region control.
18 glass beads (9 orange and 9 blue): These are placed on the name of each Economic Infrastructure as needed to note control.
12 blank ½” counters: Mark them with “May Not Assault”, then
20 “May Not Assault” markers: Mark the reverse of each with “Masked”
All Bombard markers; Mark the reverse of each with numbers so that they can be easily identified (i.e. 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10).
Powicke Bridge marker: reminder for the turn track
Turncoats marker: reminder for the turn track
London -1/Bristol -1 Captured marker: Naval Status marker
The Queen: Escaped -1/Captured +2 marker: Naval Status marker
Veteran Brigade/Extra Brigade marker: usage reminder (once per turn)
“Estates of Holland…”: Naval Status Event Card marker
“Orangist Support…”: Naval Status Event Card marker
Note: With the exception of the glass beads (which are an aesthetic choice) all of these markers can be created or modified from the original counter sheets using some of the blanks and a label maker with clear tape for printing (my method). As for choice of counters I used the following:
• Powicke Bridge – light blue “marbled”
• Turncoats – blue/tan oriented perpendicular to “Turncoats”
• London-1 / Bristol -1 – light blue “marbled” double-sided 
• The Queen escapes -1 /The queen Captured +2 – tan double-sided
• Veteran Brigade / Extra Brigade – tan (sadly I couldn’t find another double-sided tan, so reverse is white)
• “Estates of Holland…” – tan
 “Orangist Support…” – tan</notes>

    <notes>Shrinkwrapped Brits in heat . . . Unhappy King Charles! allows two players to decide whether Commons or Cavalier shall rule in England. Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.
The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.

    <notes>The game is played twice. The rulebook is read intensively and shows some signs of that (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a fresh print out anyway), but the components are in excellent shape.
I will ship anywhere in the world and never ask more then actual shipping costs. Shipping of multiple items can be combined.
Payment through PayPal (worldwide) or bank transfer (within EU).
Any questions? Just ask!
