   <description>Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;handshakes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;HS_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;couples_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times;2 for the multiplier._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I will send to anywhere in Australia posted the next business day. For postage quotes, please let me have your postcode. I will package multiple games together to save postage. I charge what it costs to post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; pack. Direct bank transfer preferred. Delivery/collection is possible in Melbourne (see faq on website).
For full range of games please check www.games.unhalfbricking.com
Please do not bother making offers below my advertised price on NEW games. This is as cheap as I can manage.</notes>

LOST CITIES
For the daring and adventurous, there are many lost cities to explore. They are in the Himalayas, the ever-shifting sands of the desert, the Brazilian rain forest, ancient volcanoes and in Neptune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Realm. With limited resources the players must choose wh ich expeditions to begin. Those with high confidence may want to up the stakes: increasing the rewards for success, but risking more should the expedition fail. The player who finds the right balance will find victory!

LOST CITIES
For the daring and adventurous, there are many lost cities to explore. They are in the Himalayas, the ever-shifting sands of the desert, the Brazilian rain forest, ancient volcanoes and in Neptune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Realm. With limited resources the players must choose wh ich expeditions to begin. Those with high confidence may want to up the stakes: increasing the rewards for success, but risking more should the expedition fail. The player who finds the right balance will find victory!

Type: Card Games 
Number of players: 2
Age of players: 10+
Length: 30 minutes
Game Description: 
For the daring and adventurous, there are many lost cities to explore. They are in the Himalayas, the ever-shifting sands of the desert, the Brazilian rain forest, ancient volcanoes and in Neptune’s Realm. With limited resources the players must choose which expeditions to begin. Those with high confidence may want to up the stakes: increasing the rewards for success, but risking more should the expedition fail. The player who finds the right balance will find victory!</notes>

    <notes>Brand-new factory-sealed ***SLOVENIAN*** Version
A curio for a US gamer, perhaps -- IZGUBLJENA MESTA (the Slovenian version). Since the game is language-independent, this doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really matter (though the rules are in Slovenian so if you need rules in English read an online translation or PDF). 
This copy was handed to me in a group of gift boxes by the designer himself, the good Doctor (though it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not a signed copy -- Reiner just gave it to me as a little gift after a visit). We enjoy Lost Cities a lot, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need this extra copy. So if you want to enjoy Lost Cities -- and you like the idea of a shrink-wrapped Slovenian version -- buy buy buy. :)</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO124)
For the daring and adventurous, there are many lost cities to explore. They are in the Himalayas, the ever-shifting sands of the desert, the Brazilian rain forest, ancient volcanoes and in Neptune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Realm. With limited resources the players must choose which expeditions to begin. Those with high confidence may want to up the stakes: increasing the rewards for success, but risking more should the expedition fail. The player who finds the right balance will find victory! </notes>

    <notes>This game was received in a trade. It is complete. The box has very minor shelf wear, and the cards and board are still in very good condition. 
There is a possibility of getting a slightly lower shipping fee for this game as I am selling this for a friend. 
I will ship after payment is received (and shipping costs determined.) I only charge exact shipping costs and will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO124)
For the daring and adventurous, there are many lost cities to explore. They are in the Himalayas, the ever-shifting sands of the desert, the Brazilian rain forest, ancient volcanoes and in Neptune_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Realm. With limited resources the players must choose which expeditions to begin. Those with high confidence may want to up the stakes: increasing the rewards for success, but risking more should the expedition fail. The player who finds the right balance will find victory! </notes>

    <notes>This listing is for the Rio Grande Games version.  This game has been played several times.  The cards are in good shape.  There are no creases or bends in the cards.  Some of the cards may appear _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;chipped_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the edges since they are black bordered cards.
I will ship via USPS Priority Mail so shipping is $11.</notes>

Who will discover the ancient civilizations? Two explorers embark on research journeys to remote corners of the world: the Himalayan mountains, the Central American rainforest, the Egyptian desert, a mysterious volcano, and the bottom of the sea. As the cards are played, the expedition routes take shape and the explorers earn points. The most daring adventurers make bets on the success of their expeditions. The explorer with the highest score after three rounds of expeditions wins. The rules of the game are simple, but beware: The lost cities hold many unseen mysteries!</notes>

    <notes>Classic Reiner Knizia two player card game. 
Played a few times. A little bit of wear on the box corners but the components themselves are like new. 
I usually post by Royal Mail 2nd class but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m open to requests for other postage options if you prefer. Not Hermes though; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had horrible experiences with them.</notes>
