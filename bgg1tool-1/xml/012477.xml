   <description>It's January 1921. Prohibition has been in effect for a year, and it looks like the 18th Amendment is here to stay. The problem, however, is that outlawing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; hasn't done anything to reduce the demand for booze! As a result, illegal stills dot the countryside and secret (or not-so-secret!) speakeasies are popping up all over in cities large and small. Local law enforcement may look the other way (especially if they're properly motivated) but Elliot Ness' G-Men are harder to convince. With this much money at stake, organized crime is sure to take an interest._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Bootleggers, players take on the role of enterprising bosses seeking to make a name for themselves in the illegal alcohol trade at the height of the 1920's prohibition era. Deceit, lies, and alliances of convenience are the norm as players attempt to control distribution through money and corruption by muscling in on the competition, paying off the local law authorities, building underground speakeasies, and shipping trucks of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;hooch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

This is the first edition from Eagle Games. Two cards have been misprinted, and corrected by hand. But for those two this game would be in Very Good condition.
This game has been adult-owned in a smoke-free, child-free, pet-free household. Played fewer than 5 times.

    <notes>Selling Bootleggers by Eagle Games. Following modifications/additions have been applied: The numbers on the plastic trucks have been painted yellow for better readability. Added 50_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;000 play money notes from another game since we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d always run out of money with the stock. Plastic components have been plastic bagged.</notes>

    <notes>2004 Edition, pristine condition, never been played, custom tuck-boxes (see photos).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 96oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>The game is 100% complete and is in excellent condition, inclusive of all pieces. It includes extra money from Eagle Games which is important because this has been cited as a problem from the original game. So problem solved! There is no game box damage and no wear, pics to follow soon.  I have inventoried all of the pieces. I require a money order or cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check to complete the transaction. Will provide a picture of the game in the shipping box to confirm it is being protected to your satisfaction. Can also e-mail pictures to your e-mail address prior to shipment. In Seattle, I can meet to personally deliver the game. Shipment for Canada to (B.C.) British Columbia only.</notes>

I do not add handling fees or over charge on shipping, I only charge the exact amount. Geek mail me for a shipping quote.
I will combine shipping, however, it may take me a day or two longer to ship due to finding the right size box. Click on my user name above to see any other games I am selling.

    <notes>Played once or twice, and I usually shuffle by dealing out cards on the table, not riffling or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;standard shuffle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; if you get my meaning.
I found it VERY difficult to see the numbers on the trucks, so I traced over them with a white/silver sharpie.  I am not the most steady of hand, but at least you can tell which truck is where.  I can upload pictures if you need.
I have a couple custom tuckboxes to hold the cards.
I generally don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like box inserts (unless they are REALLY good) so I ditched this one - but have everything in itemized zip-top baggies or similar.</notes>

    <notes>Mayday Games (MYY4307)
It is the time of the speakeasy and bath tub gin... It is the time of the BOOTLEGGERS! In Bootleggers, players will find themselves slipping into a very thematic experience as they produce and sell moonshine in the early twentieth century. Using a vast array of plastic gangsters and trucks, players must attempt to use their muscle cards to take the best action cards and control the speakeasies. With treachery, backstabbing, alliances and more, Bootleggers forces players to use their resources wisely. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good thing to produce a lot of moonshine at the distilleries but too much will bring the police down on your business, and hired thugs might steal your trucks or worse! Bootleggers is a combination of good mechanics with a healthy dose of American theme for a fun, rewarding experience. </notes>

The game is 100% complete of course. All the pieces are kept in ziplocked bags. It comes from a non smoking home and has been very well kept. 
More images of the game are available on request.

Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

Just trying to price it fairly for both the buyer and the seller, and give this game a good home where it might get played. Thanks for looking, and while this is a heavy game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll work with the buyer on shipping somehow...</notes>

    <notes>In very good condition. 
CAUTION: It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the first Eagle-Gryphon Games version, therefore the 2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Double Influence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards are missing due to production error. The game is still play-able!
I will ship from Germany and I am willing to ship anywhere.
Please ask me for the shipping costs for your country.
You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.</notes>

    <notes>Components are in excellent condition.  Box has some moderate wear.  The number on top of each of the trucks has been traced with a gold paint marker making them MUCH easier to see.  Two of the cards were printed by the publisher with an incorrect value.  They have been corrected with a Sharpie.
You pay purchase price and shipping (via PayPal)...or...I will meet you in person in the Nashville area to make a cash transaction.
PLEASE DO NOT purchase this item and THEN ask for a shipping estimate.  BEFORE purchasing, send me a message with your shipping zip code, and I will reply with the shipping cost.  Then you will know the total cost before purchasing. 
THANK YOU!
Cheers.</notes>
