   <description>Flat Top is a board game of high complexity that covers the battles of the Solomon Seas between the United States and Japan in 1942. It is very well researched and covers all aspects of naval and air combat as it existed in 1942. The system depicts weather, air searches, air combat, surface combat, carrier operations, submarines, air bases, supplies, and much more. The game requires intense planning and searching since movement is covert and the map is pretty huge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The units are individual ships and submarines with each air point representing three aircraft. Hexes are twenty miles, and each turn represents one-hour._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game includes thirteen hundred counters, 4 maps to create a 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 28_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; map of the South Pacific, four Allied/Japanese operations cards, three player aid cards, and two log sheets._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I bought this used about eight years ago.  I played it once.  I did not have a problem with missing pieces.   There are plenty of unused mapsheets for the game.  The board and pieces are in excellent condition while the box shows signs of fading but had no rips.   It is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Battle Line_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box with the red+white rising-sun cover.  It also includes a rules cheat sheet that I made.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been played (but not by myself).  About 80% of the counters are unpunched.  Those that were used were in a few very old envelopes (I put some tape on the envelopes to make sure they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t leak.  One of the charts had a small amount of penciled writing in one spot(errata?).  The rulebook was in very good physical shape, but did contain some marks in the margins to identify key rules.  Everything else looks in very good shape.  I would keep this game if there was any chance I would play it.

    <notes>I am listing it as new even though it is not in the shrink wrap. There is some very light staining from age on the box. Otherwise this game is perfect and near mint. The counters are unpunched and just begging to punched out! The maps are perfect, as is the rulebook, the player aids, and the logs. This is great collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s or players copy!</notes>

    <notes>AH revised edition with revamped cover art.
Punched and bagged (so much stuff in box a tray won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit).
All components near new condition. It looks like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never been played. Even the box looks new.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy: Will ship in first class or priority box for $12 to U.S. addresses. $25 to Canada. $32 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>I have to list this as Acceptable condition because the corners of the box are all split; but the game itself looks to be unplayed. Most of the pieces are unpunched, and the pads are both there.  So while the box has some problems, the game itself looks great.</notes>

    <notes>This game was set up and a few turns played one or two times as I tried to learn the rules, but never got everything down.  All parts included. Good shape and ready for someone to play. The game parts will be shipped in ziplock bags and not in the plastic containers to save weight. Non Smoking home.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and in good condition.  Counters have been punched, but all are accounted for.  Box displays some wear and discoloration, but is sound. 
Flat Top is a board game of high complexity that covers the battles of the Solomon Seas between the United States and Japan in 1942. It is very well researched and covers all aspects of naval and air combat as it existed in 1942. The system depicts weather, air searches, air combat, surface combat, carrier operations, submarines, air bases, supplies, and much more. The game requires intense planning and searching since movement is covert and the map is pretty huge.
The units are individual ships and submarines with each air point representing three aircraft. Hexes are twenty miles, and each turn represents one-hour.
The game includes thirteen hundred counters, 4 maps to create a 44_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 28_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of the South Pacific, four Allied/Japanese operations cards, three player aid cards, and two log sheets.</notes>
