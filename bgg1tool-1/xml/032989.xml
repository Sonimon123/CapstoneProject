Totaler Krieg!
 This game stretches from the fjords of Narvik to the sands at El Alamein, from the gates of Moscow to the sandy beaches of Normandy, from the Spanish Civil War to the last days in Berlin and everything in between. No game tells the story of World War II in Europe like Totaler Krieg!
This new edition of our popular Krieg! game is still the same highly playable, unpredictable and enjoyable experience it always has been. What’s new is a design and graphic update and expansion to give you more options -- especially if you want to explore the critical pre-war period from 1937 to 1939. What if the Republicans had won the Spanish Civil War? What if Germany and Russia hadn’t signed their Non-Aggression Pact? What if France had modernized its army instead of building the Maginot Line? All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategies of the three factions -- Axis, Soviet Allies, and Western Allies.
Best of all, Totaler Krieg! can be linked with its new Pacific companion game, Axis Empires: Dai Senso!, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, an eye-opening global look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands!
Totaler Krieg means Total War in German. In the game, play moves from Pre-War (where players mobilize their forces and engage in diplomacy) to Limited War (when open conflict begins) to Total War -- at that point, it’s all-out warfare to achieve victory!

This game stretches from the fjords of Narvik to the sands of El Alamein, from the gates of Moscow to the beaches of Normandy, from the Spanish Civil War to the last days in Berlin and everything in between. No game tells the story of World War II in Europe like Totaler Krieg! This new edition of our popular Krieg! game is still the playable, unpredictable and enjoyable experience it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s always been. What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s new is a design and graphic update and expansion to give you more options - especially if you want to explore the critical pre-war period from 1937 to 1939. What if the Republicans had won the Spanish Civil War? What if Germany and Russia hadn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t signed their Non-Aggression Pact? What if France had modernized its army instead of building the Maginot Line? All of these options are literally in the cards that form the strategy for the major powers. Best of all, Totaler Krieg! can be linked with its new Pacific War companion game, Dai Senso!, to play the joint Axis Empires scenario, a global eye opening look at all of World War II. The fate of the world is in your hands! Totaler Krieg! means Total War in German. Total War refers to the moment in the game when play moves from Limited War with its combination of mobilization, maneuver, and diplomacy to Total War with it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all out warfare to achieve victory. </notes>

    <notes>Condition - Unpunched and unplayed, box has slight shelf wear. Components in like new condition.
Note - if purchased with the companion game Axis Empires: Dai Senso!, will bulk lot sell the pair for $110.00 plus shipping.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a very large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>I played through each scenario and campaign game once. Many minor nation or special forces pieces unpunched. Virtually no wear and tear or shelf wear. There are many notes and articles I printed out included to clarify certain rules or strategies. You will not be disappointed for this price. Lifetime gamer. Non smoker. I suspect I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tackle it again, and want somebody else to play it.</notes>
