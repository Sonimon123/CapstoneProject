   <description>One of the more unusual collectible card games on the market, Doomtown has players taking the part of gangs, called 'outfits,' trying to gain control of the California boomtown known as Gomorrah, in the same Weird West setting as the popular Deadlands RPG. A player wins at the end of a turn if he or she has more victory points + control points than any other player._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Doomtown is set apart from other games in CCG market by its unique poker-based combat resolution, as well as by the way in which the town is built up through the game by the use of Deed cards. Outfits range from the good-guy Law Dogs to the mysterious Sioux Union to the nefarious Whateley clan._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A turn is played out over one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the gambling phase players play a hand of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Lowball_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; ( Unlike other Doomtown poker hands, the lowest hand wins.), to determine who will go first for the rest of the turn. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Next in the upkeep phase, income is collected and upkeep for Dudes from another outfit are paid for._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The next phase is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;High Noon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, during this phase, shopping and trading, moving, acting and calling out (all specific actions related to the game play) are taken. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Finally, there is the Nightfall phase, during this phase, the events of the day are discarded, players hands are replenished and cards are returned to their _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ready_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; state._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Selling my whole massive collection. I love, love, love this game, but never play it anymore.
Collection includes over 3000 cards, from every expansion released, including the Do Unto Others series ending expansion box. Tons of rares included, I did almost no trading, and even bought extra rares off of eBay back in the day to bolster decks. 
Message me with any questions about contents. Cards are well sorted and I can likely tell you if cards you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in are present.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This is my entire collection of Doomtown. It is in the multiple thousands of cards - over 25 pounds by weight. It includes at least 4 of nearly all commons of all sets, and approximately 1/15 of the cards are rares (i.e. I have not traded out the rares selectively). It also have two sets of the recent Do Unto Others exclusive release (minus a few cards which were in decks that were stolen). It contains all the cards anyone would ever need for the game and could field numerous decks simultaneously.  The cards are all in very good condition and have not been played without sleeves.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d also consider offers of games (see my want list).
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send more information about the exact quantity of cards (inc. a picture).</notes>

    <notes>I am selling my entire collection of about 700 cards.  
I have 5 decks in their tuck boxes (blackjacks, maze rats, sweetrock, the flock and the sioux), and a lawdogs deck without a tuck box. In addition, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the entire _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;do unto others_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set, which alone sells for about $25 on eBay.  There are also about 150-200 cards from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pine box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, plus cards from various sets.  All have been opened and most have been played with but mostly in very good to almost new condition (cards from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;do unto others_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; set was never played with).  
I am marking the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because of those cards that have seen use.
There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more than enough here for a group of 3-4 to try various combinations of decks and enough loose cards outside of the decks to customize your own. In addition to the 6 decks mentioned above, there are enough cards (outfit homes included) to make decks for most of the outfits in the game.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good, thematic game but the poker shooting aspect didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t connect with my group.

    <notes>This is a set of 1500 cards with minimal duplication (see below).  Cards have been handled, but not played, and are in good condition.  Shipping is a flat $10 anywhere in the USA.
I imagine this set will most appeal to someone new to the game who just wants a wide variety of cards.  Everything one would need to play the game is here, including 1 to 3 homes from each Outfit and a supply of 1, 2 and 5 denomination ghost rock cards.
On duplication: For the Dudes (spades) there are no duplicates, except for some non-unique abominations for which I included 3 copies.  This made a stack of about 370 Dudes.  The other suits have about the same number of cards, with no more than 2 copies of any card.
On rarity: these are mostly common and uncommon.  I expect there are some rares included, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time to go through and determine the exact count.  Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect a bunch, though; if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking to fill out your missing rares, this probably isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the deal for you.
To get an idea of the variety, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s included for the Blackjack dudes: Black Jack (exp), Rachel Sumner, Darren Titus (exp), Vampiric Dance Hall Girl, Darren Titus, Andra Miles, Jason Jung, Andrew Garret, Skunky Swade, William Rose (exp), Mae Parker, Peter Motambu, Ely Parker, Jeb Parker, The Twitch, Oliver Kingsley, William Rose, Sam Horowitz, Flint Parker, Cletus Peacock, Wendigo Garrison, Rhett Caufield, Natalie Sherman, Father Juan Navarro, Lawrence Goodman, Victor Navarro, Alfred Barkum Jr.</notes>

    <notes>A rather large collection of doomtown cards with cards from all episodes, very few promos though. 
Most of the cards have never or very rarely been used for playing. 
The rate of rares to commons is probably slightly better than in the original packaging as I have thrown out some commons if I felt I had too many.
You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be able to make many good decks from this collection. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re into this, I think there is quite good value for money here.
