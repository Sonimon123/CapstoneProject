   <description>From Dunwich to Innsmouth, from the halls of Miskatonic University to the Charles Dexter Ward at Arkham Asylum, trouble is in the air. The stars are almost right, and terrors from beyond space and time are beginning to break through. When Cthulhu rises, we're all doomed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but whose downfall will be the most entertaining?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Cthulhu Gloom takes the game play of Atlas' Gloom and puts a Lovecraftian spin on it. Each player controls a group of protagonists, and your goal is to make them as miserable and insane as possible _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; preferably with them dying quickly while your opponents' heroes remain sane and (at a minimum) alive. In the publisher's description: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As in Gloom, the cards in Cthulhu Gloom are transparent, allowing you to stack multiple modifier cards on a character card to alter its stats or undo what an opponent has done to you. While Cthulhu Gloom can be played on its own or combined with Gloom and its many expansions, it does introduce two new types of cards:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Story cards can be in play from the start of the game, and the first player to meet a Story card's conditions _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; e.g., drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; claims the card and gains its benefits (or drawbacks)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Transformation cards mutate a character for the remainder of the game, no matter which modifiers might come its way later. What's more, the character's image is replaced with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;something hideous and slimy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. You'd expect no less really..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Atlas Games (ATG 1330)
A transparent card game from Atlas Games 
From Dunwich to Innsmouth, from the halls of Miskatonic University to the Charles Dexter Ward at Arkham Sanitarium, trouble is in the air. The stars are almost right, and terrors from beyond space and time are beginning to break through. When Cthulhu rises, we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all doomed -- but whose downfall will be the most entertaining? 
In Cthulhu Gloom, you control a group of Lovecraftian protagonists and guide them down a path of horror and madness to an untimely death, while keeping your opponents happy, healthy, and annoyingly alive. While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins. 
Cthulhu Gloom is printed on transparent plastic cards. Multiple Modifier cards can be played on top of the same Character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played Modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You can immediately and easily see the point value of every character, no matter how many Modifiers they have piled on. 
Cthulhu Gloom is a stand-alone card game that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also fully compatible with Gloom and its expansions. It introduces Story cards and Transformation cards. 
One or more Story cards can be placed face up on the table at the start of the game; the first player to meet the conditions of a card -- drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu, for example -- can claim it and gain the benefits it lists. 
Transformation cards have ongoing effects that remain with a character throughout his life, along with a picture that replaces the character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original art with something hideous and slimy; when you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve Felt Rather Fishy or been Minced by Mi-Go, the squamous results aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t easily forgotten! </notes>

    <notes>Atlas Games (ATG1330)
The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get any worse, they do. But some say that one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond. In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins. Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got to see (through) this game to believe it! </notes>

    <notes>The game has been played only once and is in very good condition. The box has some signs of shelfwear/use particularly on the box flap. The cards are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;as new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; except for one which has a crease in the top corner where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been bent back (the card came like this).
Any other questions, let me know.
