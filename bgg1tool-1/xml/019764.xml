Game Description: 
PÜNCT is the final game of Project GIPF, a series of games that, as you probably know, was announced to consist of 6 games and a number of sets with additional pieces. GIPF, the central game of the Project, was initially release in Belgium in 1997. Now, 8 years later, the series is complete.PÜNCT is a connection game: the goal is to link two opposite sites. On your turn, you either bring a new piece into play, or you move a piece that is already on the board. The more pieces you bring into play, the more possibilities you have to make a connection. Butx each time you put a new piece on the board, you reveal a bit of what your plan is. The trick is to place your pieces in such a way that your opponent will expect you to do something different from what you really have in mind. As such, PÜNCT is not only about making a connection, but also about misleading your opponent! You’ll have to proceed subtle!</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO283)
PÜNCT is the final game of Project GIPF, a series of games that, as you probably know, was announced to consist of 6 games and a number of sets with additional pieces. GIPF, the central game of the Project, was initially release in Belgium in 1997. Now, the series is complete. PÜNCT is a connection game: the goal is to link two opposite sites. On your turn, you either bring a new piece into play, or you move a piece that is already on the board. The more pieces you bring into play, the more possibilities you have to make a connection. But... each time you put a new piece on the board, you reveal a bit of what your plan is. The trick_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s to place your pieces in such a way that your opponent will expect you to do something different from what you really have in mind. As such, PÜNCT is not only about making a connection, but also about misleading your opponent! You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to proceed subtle!</notes>
