   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Fill Yore Hand ..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; with Gunslinger, the game of western gunfights. In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Peacemaker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, Smith _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy.  The box has heavy wear and 2 torn corners on the lid.  All of the cards (FAC and action cards) are beginning to yellow.  The rulebook and charts are (well-) used.  There is one character and two pistol counters missing.  The maps are all in excellent condition.
Assuming that you use a substitute counter for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Prospector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (missing character), the game is completely playable.
This game has been going for $35-50 on eBay.  Get it cheap here.</notes>

    <notes>Components all accounted for. A lot of the counters are still unpunched (the rest are in small ziplock bags). Game looks like it was hardly played, if at all. The box cover has been repaired. There was a hole pushed through the box. Everything was pushed back into place and tape was placed on inside of cover to hold it. Damage is noticible as a deep crease. Rest of box strong and very bright. Pictures upon request.</notes>

    <notes>Box is pretty thoroughly beaten, but pieces are intact. All Action and Results cards are present. All character counters are definitely present; I THINK all the other counters are present as well, but the game contains no list against which to check.
The rabbit also nibbled around the edges of mapboards A(AA) and B(BB). In addition, the hexes on the lower third of mapboard BB are missing.
If you want pix of the damaged box and board(s), let me know.</notes>

    <notes>Condition closer to Good, because the components are in great shape, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s complete.  But the instructions are a xerox copy, and there is a split corner on the box w/ a big tear/scrape on the right edge.  The central image on the box cover is unscathed.  Great, hard to find game, all the important parts (i.e. board, cards, components) are there and in great shape.  
I prefer paypal through a checking acct or cash balance.  Otherwise a personal check or money order is fine.</notes>

    <notes>I would list this game as being in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition except for the fact that the rules are missing (but are available on the web).  I do not think it has ever been played.  Most counters and some cards are unpunched.  3-4 result cards show very slight stains from deterioration of the rubber bands used to hold them.  The box is almost like new (slight crease in one corner).</notes>

    <notes>I was a boardgame collector in the Eighties, but have not played in the last fifteen years. I never bought used items, I only bought them new in the shop. I have played GUNSLINGER a few times (20-30) in the Eighties, but was very very carefully. All items are still included, there are even much more coloured markers and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;stones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The board is MINT as are the rulebook and the rest. There are two faults: The box is in perfect condition, but on the left and the right book-side are two bad little spots on the bottom. There is one card in the set that has a dirty line on one side (all sides have text; you can read it without problems). Shipping: Germany 6 Euro. EU in Europe: 17 Euro. Rest of Europe: 30 Euro. USA, Canada: 35 Euro. Rest of the World: 40 Euro. International Paying per PayPal, in Europe and Germany bank transfer too - auch per Überweisung. Perfekt erhaltene Ausgabe von GUNLINGER, die wie neu aussieht mit zwei Mängeln. Die tadellos erhaltene Box hat an den schmalen Bookcase-Seiten jeweils unten zwei kleine schadhafte Stellen. Eine der Karten im Set hat auf einer Seite (beide sind mit Text bedruckt) eine schmutzige Linie (durch den Gummi, der herumgespannt war).</notes>

    <notes>An oldie but a goodie that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling here on the Geek, because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like a fan to be able to own an affordable and playable copy of Gunslinger.  From a smoke-free home.
The box has no split corners, just some shelf wear and other minor signs of its age.  Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a complete inventory of the contents:
- ALL mapboards present; they show their age a bit but are still firm, clear, and un-battered.
- The rules are intact, with a little bit of writing on a couple of the charts.  The front page is curling and dog-eared.
- ALL 4 player aid cards present.
- ALL 108 Result Cards present.  A few have slight stains on the info side, but the backs look good and solid; the cards are straight and none are creased, crinkled, ripped, or dog-eared.  This deck is in good condition.
- All of the sets of action cards present, except for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Circle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; #3.  If you play with 7 players and need the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Circle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; action cards, substitute a bonus card for #3 if necessary.
It looks like all the bonus cards you might need or want are here, but here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a complete rundown: (B1 - 4 cards, B2 - 7, B3 - 7, B4 - 5, B5 - 5, B6 - 5, B7 - 5, B8 - 4, B9 - 4)
Counters:
- All 8 horses
- Buckboard/Stage
- All character counters present (and looking good)
- 10 head counters (I think that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all of them)
- 10 generic aim counters, 13 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;symbol_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; aim counters (missing 1 square one - subsitute a generic one if necessary when playing game)
- 21 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; delay counters, 8 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; delay counters
- All 10 GB/CB/BD counters present
- All melee weapons present - 8 knives, 3 TWKs, 3 DYNs
- 6 chairs
- 2 tables
- 6 bales
- 11 bottles/rocks (rocks are the obverse side ofthe bottle counters)
- 4 money bags
- 8 RX counters
- 7 TAC A/B counters
- 7 TAC C/D counters
- 2 R10s (A,B)
- 2 R10ss (A,B)
- 10 blast/smoke markers
- 8 roof/ladder counters
- 2 SH50s (A,B)
- 2 SD58s (A,B)
- 2 C45cs (A,B)
- 5 C45s (B-F) [MISSING THE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Colt 45 - this isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a problem unless you play a showdown where everybody needs Colt 45s, in which case I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve substituted one of the C45c guns in its place]
- 6 W44s (A-F)
- 3 H44s (A-C)
- 3 SW45s (A-C)
- 2 W44ss (A,B)
- 4 SW38s (A-C)
- 3 R41ds (A-C)
- 2 C36cs (A,C) [MISSING THE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Colt 36 cap-and-ball, again, the game is still quite playable, you can easily substitute for it if necessary]
- 2 C32s (A,B)
- 6 C44s (A-F)
- 4 C41s (A-D)
I used up all of the character actions sheets (sorry), but you can download the nice ones available here on the Geek.  If you like, I can toss them before I ship you this game.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll post some pictures soon.</notes>

    <notes>Comments:
Condition Notes:
Box in excellent condition. Components are aged but complete EXCEPT that a few of the record sheets have been used.  
Note that the original counters have been UPGRADED to:
Deadlands Cardboard Cowboys Weird West Set #1
Mint uncut condition. MSRP $20. This is a pack of over 200 full-color tri-fold cardstock standup figures. Perfect for 
playing Gunslinger!
The Weird West standups are 1.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tall, with each face 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; wide. The hexes are oversized, so the standups should fit fine. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hard to see in the picture, but each one has 3 sides and a little flap to glue. Two of the sides are in color, and the third is a black silhouette. So if you look directly down on them from above, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re triangle-shaped, with the point between the two color sides being the front facing.
Note: the original counters are the circular and square die-cut cardboard pieces that you can see in the scans posted on BGG.  Those are all missing, except for the horses and a stagecoach.
Additional related material that I will also throw in:
Gunslinger Expansion from the General Magazine
Aged but uncut condition. This consists of two sheets of heavy paper/ light cardstock, one with rules and the other with cutout counters for various weapons and animals (wildcats, bears, bison and cattle).
To clarify the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition further: the mapboards are in very good shape, while the paper components (rulebook, cards and such) are showing their age, with some discoloration. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not pristine, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re playable.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
I do not typically accept Paypal payments from users with less than 50 positive references here on BGG. (Too much risk). However, I can take a Paypal payment from US-buyers if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive references on BGG. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
(Also see the note at the bottom regarding Paypal payments impact on the discounted price being offered here).
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.

    <notes>Unpunched, cards intact in sheets. Box, very minor shelf wear on corners. Game is very crisp and clean. Comes with extra scenarios, series replay, printed extra counters, (black and white out of magazine looks like.)
Buyer liable for shipping damage or loss, if no insurance purchased.
Pay Pal only from international buyers. Buyer Must be pay pal verified, and have pay pal verified address. Any check must clear before shipping. Please email any questions.
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use USPS boxes unless I reinforce it very well. I ship in a very well padded _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; reinforced box, the bottom is laminated and glued with tite bond. I also pack the inside of game so all is tight. I will ship buyers choice, except free...LOL! 
Please give zip or country, for shipping quote. Thank you for looking.
Cheers,

    <notes>New in shrink. Box in excellent condition. Tiny stain (less than 1/2 cm2) on one side where something (maybe glue) got below the shrink. Tiny corner scuffs despite shrink of the size typical in many new retail games.
Prefer local pickup in the Greater Toronto Area.</notes>

    <notes>This is basically a new copy.  I bought it via Ebay a few months ago and it was unpunched and never used.  Even the perforated cards had to be separated from the sheet.  I did punch the tokens myself and organize them and played a single game.  The cards were sleeved when we played and you cannot even tell the components were used.
The box itself has a torn corner (came that way) but is otherwise fine.  All components are present and in perfect condition.
Shipping and handling will be $8 to the U.S.</notes>

    <notes>The box shows some shelf wear but minor at that... the components, charts, board, etc are like new. I looked at the asking prices here on BGG for this game (the ones in US$) and the average price (mathematically) works out to $150. I am asking for exactly half that price... and remember, the game itself is in great shape - the scoring pads were never even used (photocopies were made to record data on), even the promotional material for other AH games, reordering cards, etc are also included... just like the day it was purchased, over 30 years ago. Price does not include shipping, but I will charge actual cost only.</notes>

    <notes>My late husband collected board games.  Didn’t always play all of them, but he loved to collect. Time to find new homes for the games.  He took excellent care of his games, and if they were played, no food or drinks were allowed near  the game playing area.  
Game has been played,  but is still in good condition, no rips on the box</notes>

All items are really on stock. No fake set-up here. No Order on demand.
International Customers, our precise shipping costs are as follows:
DHL International Shipping: Zone 1 (Mostly Europe): 15,00€+1,00€ per two kilos
Shipping costs can vary greatly after that and have to be asked for individually.
We ship only fully insured. So ordering only a small pocket game or anything very low priced may come out to be very uneconomical.
Methods of payment:
-You can always pick the game up at our storage location :-)
-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use paypal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)
Für unsere deutschsprachigen Kunden:
Sie können uns für alle Fragen gerne telefonisch kontaktieren:
Tel.: 0201-786877
Die Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschlands betragen 5,- Euro (inkl. 19% Mwst.). Ab 100€ versenden wir innerhalb Deutschlands Versandkostenfrei.
Alle Preise enthalten die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer in Höhe von 19%.
Bezahlmöglichkeiten für Kunden innerhalb Deutschlands:
- Alle Kreditkarten willkommen !
- Paypal
- Vorkasse
- Rechnung (Nicht für Erstbesteller, wir behalten uns vor die Zahlungsmöglichkeit per Rechnung von Fall zu Fall neu zu bewerten !)
 
Alternativ ist natürlich auch eine Abholung mit Bar-, EC-, oder Kreditkartenzahlung in unserem Lager möglich. (Im Geschäft wird neben Brettspielen auch eine üppige Auswahl an Rollenspielen angeboten.)
Beachten Sie bitte auch unsere Aktionen und weiter Angebote auf: www. fanen.com
Widerrufsbelehrung
Widerrufsrecht
Sie können Ihre Vertragserklärung innerhalb von zwei Wochen ohne Angabe von Gründen in Textform (z. B. Brief oder E-Mail),
oder durch Rücksendung der Sache widerrufen. 
Die Frist beginnt frühestens mit Erhalt dieser Belehrung.
Zur Wahrung der Widerrufsfrist genügt die rechtzeitige Absendung des Widerrufs oder der Sache. 
Der Widerruf ist zu richten an:
Fantasy En_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Counter c/o Holger Willert
Gudulastr. 5 D(Hofgebäude rechts hinten) 
45131 Essen
email: fanen@fanen.com
Widerrufsfolgen
Im Falle eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren. 
Können Sie uns die empfangene Leistung ganz oder teilweise nicht oder nur in verschlechtertem Zustand zurückgewähren,
müssen Sie uns insoweit ggf. Wertersatz leisten. 
Bei der Überlassung von Sachen gilt dies nicht, wenn die Verschlechterung der Sache ausschließlich auf deren Prüfung - wie sie Ihnen etwa im Ladengeschäft möglich gewesen wäre - zurückzuführen ist. 
Im Übrigen können Sie die Wertersatzpflicht vermeiden, 
indem Sie die Sache nicht wie ein Eigentümer in Gebrauch nehmen und alles unterlassen, was deren Wert beeinträchtigt. 
Sie haben die Kosten der Rücksendung zu tragen, w
enn die gelieferte Ware der bestellten entspricht und wenn der Preis der zurückzusendenden Sache einen Betrag von 40 Euro nicht übersteigt,
oder wenn Sie bei einem höheren Preis der Sache zum Zeitpunkt des Widerrufs noch nicht die Gegenleistung,
oder eine vertraglich vereinbarte Teilzahlung erbracht haben. 
Anderenfalls ist die Rücksendung für Sie kostenfrei. 
Nicht paketversandfähige Sachen werden bei Ihnen abgeholt. 
Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen Sie innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung erfüllen.

    <notes>Obtained from a previous owner.
Components were only half-punched when I received, but for whatever reason the following components are missing:
1 x Pink Character Counter (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;)
2 x Light Brown Character Counters (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;L_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;)
1 x Head Counter (out of 12)
1 x Golden Brown Aim Counter with symbol (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Square_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;)
3 x Bottle Counters (out of 11)
1 x Dynamite Counter (out of 3)
1 x Knife Counter (out of 9)
1 x C45 (out of 6)
1 x C45c (out of 2)
Everything else is present and in very good condition - all boards, results cards, action cards, bonus cards, legend pad and rulebook. As well as the rest of the 250 or so counters.
My understanding is none of the missing components are crucial and that the game is still completely playable.
Box is a little worn, as pictured.
Prefer pickup/delivery, but will post at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense (circa $15).</notes>

    <notes>This game has never been played. It is still unpunched.  I picked it up over 20 years ago and never got a chance to play it due to college, marriage and kids.  It has been stored well by me but does show signs of its age being a 30 year old game. Box has a torn corner and one piece (a gunbelt) is missing.   Photo shows missing piece.  It is in good shape and I am looking to give it a good home.  Included are many copies I made of score sheets used in game so I will send them as well as game.</notes>
