   <description>In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Exceptionally rare Moskito release from the late 80_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.
Notes on the condition: some of the components in this copy do not match the pictures on the Geek. The spice jars have cork tops instead of black plastic tops, and the coffee circle chips are blank instead of stickered with little coffee cup icons. 
The stoves have moderate wear, as does the box, though Moskito boxes are notorious for this because of the light material that was used to construct them. 
Everything is present and accounted for though, and the game plays fine.
I ship using the USPS, and I ship anywhere in the world. a la Carte will fit in the flat rate priority box for those who live in the US, and that is 10$. The cost to the world will vary considerably based on where, please note that all mail leaving the US now has to be air mail, as USPS sold their boats.
I accept payment via Paypal, Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Checks, or Money Orders.
I try to ship the day following receipt of payment, and generally am able to do so.</notes>

Can you prepare the perfect dish before being sabotaged by the competition, or will your chance at culinary stardom end up in the trash?
 
A la Carte, the culinary game for 2-4 skilled French cooks, pits players against each other in a cooking war to be named top chef. Follow the recipes to heat and spice your dishes accordingly, while attempting to avoid over-seasoning or burning them. What is competition without a little treachery? Coffee Break tokens allow players to gain special benefits like the ability to swap stovetops with other players. Every perfect dish gains you a cooking star, gain three or be the player with the most victory points to win the game.
 
The finest French chefs need the finest equipment, which is why A La Carte comes with four stovetops, four pans, over 50 culinary tokens, 4 spice jars, 80 spices bits, 1 Heating die and more. Can you stand the pressure, or will the competition serve you a dish of defeat?</notes>

    <notes>Pretty old game but in great condition considering its age.  This is the German Moskito edition from 1989.  I have played it only a few times.  I do not believe the game came with a box insert as it does not have one now, however all playing pieces are complete and it includes printed English rules. 
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail.  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.  Must pay me via PayPal.</notes>

    <notes>2010 edition.  Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>Contents: One copy of A la carte, FFG edition. PLUS, one copy of the A la carte: Dessert expansion.
Condition: Both games are in the main game box only. Game is complete with an extra piece here and there.  Slight wear on most of the components. My children liked playing with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cooking game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, so one of the spoons got bent and there is some wear on some of the burner pieces, but overall it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in great shape and you can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t beat my price. If you shake one of the shakers too hard, the bottom piece of plastic will slide off. Normal gamer use will not result in this happening.
Shipping: This will ship via USPS, Regional Rate B or Flat Rate or even regular. My guess is $7-12 to ship, fully insured.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders. Bitcoin works too.</notes>

    <notes>ENGLISH RULES: Game includes extra parts: extra stove, two extra sinks and an extra tray
In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!
The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.</notes>

All stoves are Assembled and all components are bagged. I also have the 5 player Dessert Expansion still sealed in shrink and the mini Spielbox expansion if you are interested (not included with the game).

    <notes>Included is the main game and the Dessert Expansion, all in the main game box.
My copy of the game, and the expansion, is complete with all components in like new condition, sorted in zip lock bags. The expansion is included in the main game box. (I no longer have the box for the expansion.) The game box is in great condition, save for a very faint crease in the box bottom. Had I not felt it, I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have known it was there, but it is there.</notes>

    <notes>Components (recipe tiles) in English. Rules booklets in Danish/Swedish/Norwegian/Finnish; other languages are readily available from the BGG Files section.
Very minor scuffs on box corners, one slightly bent/scuffed action marker (ladle), and some clouding on bottom of one of the plastic vials; neither of these issues have any effect on game play.
Buyer pays shipping or picks up the game in Odense, DK.

To Denmark: Add DKK 70,-
