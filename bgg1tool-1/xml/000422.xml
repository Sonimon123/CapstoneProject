   <description>This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829 and adds several new elements.  Players seek to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various rail companies located on a German map. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes.  Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder.  The stock manipulation aspect of the game is not as brutal as in 1830.  Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game features minor rail companies, layered stock offerings, and the formation of the Prussian railroad from the minor companies. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>An unpunched, unplayed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 100% complete copy. The contents are in very good condition overall. Even though this copy is unpunched, I consider it a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, not a collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy.  There are some minor discolorations on the map, the manual has some slight staining on the front and one of the charts has a piece of degraded rubber band stuck to it.  None of these issues would effect play in the slightest.  The box has some shelf wear and a moderate crease across the lid from having an extremely heavy game laid against it, however it is solid with no split corners. View the pictures for details. 
Buyer to pay postage not to exceed the USPS Priority Mail Flat rate of $8.95. I will provide exact postage upon learning the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s zip code. I am willing to ship via USPS Priority Mail or FedEx Ground, whichever is least expensive or at the option of the buyer. International buyers need to contact me for rates. International buyers are required to pay using Paypal.

    <notes>English. Played, complete. The front cover of the rules, the front cover of the example booklet, and bits of the stock/playing board have some brown spots. The paper products, specifically the rule booklets, are far worse than the boards and only on the covers. All other game components are in very good shape. The box is in fair to good condition.</notes>

Paypal is my preferred method of payment.  I will also accept cash (if you are local), or perhaps a gift certificate (contact me about the latter two) but the transaction must still be run through BGG so that they get their 3% commission from me.</notes>

    <notes>Components are complete and in excellent condition.  Box cover exhibits minor shelf wear.  Game includes a copy of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1835 Coalfields_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; variant published in Rail Gamer zine.   Variant map is mounted with photo copied variant rules.  Actual shipping costs added from 44074.  Thus if you reside in the east, I will ship it cheaper than by priority flat rate by using my own box or a regional box B.</notes>

Original description:
The box has seen better days - The top has shelf-wear and the bottom is curved (not obvious for the eye, but you can definitly feel it).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the second owner of this game and I have never played this game. I can only guess what the previous owner did with his copy, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think he played it much if I look at the quality of the paper money. All the cards (share certificates,…) and tokens look new to me. The gameboard has a little bit of wear in the top part. 
The version is from Hans im Gluck (a german publisher), but on the inside I only find rules in English and no rules in German. The Share Price Index has the two languages on it. The reference card for the various phases is in German.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve counted 147 hexagonal tiles, 68 share certificates, 6 private railway certificates, 33 train cards, 8 large charters and 6 small charters as noted in the rulebook.
The amount of tokens isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mentioned, but looking at the available photo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s on BGG this also looks complete. (being the second owner I wanted to check this to be shure).
Components = nearly new, box = not great but OK.
On the photo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s on BGG I can see a wooden traintoken for the first player. In this box it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a red cilinder.
I hope this gives enough information, but if there are still some questions, do not hesitate to ask them.

    <notes>Never played.  Components unpunched.   
Game was in storage for many years.  There are discolorations (yellow spots) on a very small number of the components, to include a few hexes of the map.  The box also shows these discolorations on the inside - to a much larger degree.  The front page of the German rules also has these discolorations.
Shipping costs extra. Shipping from Maryland (21146). Will ship worldwide but note that it will be expensive (better to have someone receive it for you in the U.S.)
Shipping costs can be combined if you purchase other items that I am selling.
PayPal for payment. USPS for shipment.
If you are outside the U.S., please add 2 percent of the total (to include shipping costs) to cover the extra PayPal fees.</notes>
