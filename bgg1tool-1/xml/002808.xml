   <description>On the 18th of December, 1940 Hitler issued Fuhrer Directive No. 21, code named Barbarossa, which stated: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;The Soviet Union is to be crushed in one swift campaign before the war with England ends._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On the 22nd of June, 1941, Barbarossa was finally launched. Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders. The initial advance was fantastic. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners were taken and the motorized divisions began to outrun the rest of the army. The Germans reached the gates of Moscow, victor in sight. Then the winter came._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN has been universally acclaimed as one of the finest wargames around. With the ease and playability of the 'Classics', the game also conveys the feel of the actual campaign and is exceptionally accurate historically. Both players will have to use the subtle skills, advantages, and tactics of their historical counterparts to win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game features include rail movement, sea movement, invasions, stukas, partisans, automatic victory, SS units, sudden death victory conditions, and double impulse movement capabilities. Seven scenarios break the total campaign down into its most important battles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 28_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mapboard, various playing aids and charts, and a twelve-page rulebook.

CONDITION: Very Good condition overall, contents near mint, unused and complete, with UNPUNCHED counters.  The board still has tissue paper between the leaves!  The box has light shelfwear and creasing with one split corner.

    <notes>This is the second edition. One piece is missing (with a homemade substitute) -- see below.
Box top is substantially concave and has an outward bow. One corner had split but was (neatly) glued back together. There are a few ripples in the paper on the box top. Box top shows substantial wear along the edges. Box bottom also shows wear.
The rulebook shows wear and dirt from use, and is missing one of its staples. The OB charts show wear and dirt.  The mapboards are in good condition, with light wear and light dirt.  The counters are in acceptable condition, with substantial wear and light dirt. One piece -- the German 44th 5-4 infantry -- is missing.  I made an (amateurish) replacement. All the other pieces are present.  There are multiple properly colored blank counters if you would like to make a better replacement for the missing infantry unit.</notes>

    <notes>3rd Edition Rules. This is the final (definitive) Avalon Hill version.
CONDITION: Good condition overall, contents lightly used and 100% complete, with counters punched, sorted and bagged. The box has some shelfwear,and split corners.
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £10.00
Rest of World Postage: £18.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.

The game box has signs of age: scuff marks on the edges and two of the corners are split. Otherwise it is still fully functional.
Please contact me for shipping costs. I pack very safely/securely.

Not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;high use_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as many second hand TRCs are (my personal favorite too). box is good. plus I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a few bonus items. In addition to articles from the more HTF publications e.g. Battleplan has 3 TRC articles (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not bothering with making you General photocopies) I have some DIY charts I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve collected as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sold about 2 dozen of these and you acquire a lot of what the other guy made for the game</notes>

    <notes>Shrinkwrap
NOTE: Apparently there a multiple editions of this game that were published in exactly the same box.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed this as AH 1st Edition because that was the only choice BGG provided.  Given the box and shrinkwrap are pristine, bright colors, etc., I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d guess that this is a 2nd or 3rd edition of the AH game and less likely a 1st edition as I find it hard to believe a game could be 50 years old and still in this condition.  There is no way I could find to identify the exact edition without opening the shrinkwrap.</notes>
