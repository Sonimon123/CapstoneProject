   <description>Super Dungeon Explore (SDE) is a dungeon crawler inspired by old Japanese console RPGs. The 52 included miniatures are done in a cute / chibi / super-deformed style, which means the head is roughly the same size as the rest of the body._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One to five players take the role of classic fantasy heroes like the human paladin, a dwarf fighter, or an elf ranger. One player is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Dark Consul_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; who controls the monsters of the dungeon. Every hero/monster has a character card that details the stats for movement, attack, armor, willpower, dexterity, action points and hearts (= life points). Additional information may include special abilities / actions / attacks and potions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is played on modular dungeon boards. During a round of play, the game passes back and forth between single heroes and the monsters, but the exact order may change from round to round. The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks. If the heroes wound the opponent, they may draw loot cards to improve their stats. There is also the possibility to open treasure chests to find even more powerful things. The monsters have no possibility to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;level up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; apart from a single late game upgrade but the Dark Consul has an unlimited number of them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To win the game, the Dark Consul must defeat all heroes in his dungeon. The heroes must spawn the dungeon boss by killing monsters or destroying all spawning points (= entry points for new monsters). The heroes must then kill the dungeon boss to be victorious._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time to paint the minis so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve decided to sell my S.D.E. All minis are assembled (except for a couple tiny pieces). Heroes are primed with gray primer, monsters are not primed. Two of the heroes are fully painted to a good standard, but not seal coated.
 Cards are still factory sealed, dice were never used, counters un-punched, game was never played.
I will wrap the minis separately to minimize the risk of damage. Be aware however that some pieces may need to be re-glued no matter how well it is packed, these are plastic minis afterall. Will only charge actual shipping cost but be aware that this will weigh around 6 lbs when packed for shipping...Parcel post woulod be around $14, priority to East coast probably around $20 West coast $30.</notes>

    <notes>I bought it, assembled it, painted it, bagged it, but no one wanted to play it.  Sad.  I have done a black wash/dry brush painting technique.  All the heroes are a solid light blue color with black wash.  100% complete except for the plastic box insert. After assembly, I could not get the insert AND the figures back in the box. Again, LIKE NEW and complete. Bonus! Comes with Candy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Cola expansion figure and card. United States shipping only. Paypal and Money Order OK. 20.00 flat shipping-Insurance included.</notes>

    <notes>Only played twice. All assembled. Boards in excellent shape. 2 quirks in assembly though: 1)a figurine standing on its tail broke and I had to reglue it. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sturdy now (see photo 1). 2)The large dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s feet got glued on a touch out of the grove and so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little off center (see photo 2). Overall, still in great shape. All other minis great(see photo 3).

    <notes>Up for sale is a copy of Super Dungeon Explore that has been played once.  I really liked the game, but my gaming group doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to share my same passions.  The game is fully assembled, and I was the one to do the assembly, to which I am very experienced being a Warhammer 40K player as well.  I looked over the game to make sure all the pieces were still in the box since I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played it in so long.  Every card, game board, rule book, miniature, and all dice are accounted for, not to mention the large number of tokens in the game.  I found nothing damaged and all cards are still sharp.  I am also including the expansions Rock Top Gang as well as Fireflow Denizens in this sale.  This adds even more monsters, cards, and treasure.  I should note that I painted one of the fire gels since they are so cute (sorry / you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re welcome?).
This sale includes all of the following:
-Complete assembled Copy of Super Dungeon Explore
-Rock Top Gang (more monsters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; cards)
-Fireflow Denizens (more monsters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; cards)</notes>

    <notes>Included in this sale is:
-Super Dungeon Explore Core Game - 53 minis (9 heroes, boss, 2 minibosses, 5 spawn points, 16 dice, lots of cards, and more)
-Caverns of Roxor Expansion - 31 minis (3 heroes, boss, miniboss, fireflow denizens and rock top minions, plus 6 treasures)
-Von Drakk Manor Expansion - 34 minis (3 heroes, boss, miniboss, undead denizens and minions, plus 6 treasures)
The core game has been played twice, Caverns of Roxor has been played once, and Von Drakk Manor has never been played.  All miniatures, cards, tokens, dice, and game box are in factory condition (some still remain unpunched, and some cards are still shrink wrapped).  This game has been properly stored in a child-free, pet-free and smoke-free home.  I no longer have the time to play unfortunately, so I decided to put the game and expansions up for sale.  Some of the figures have been painted by myself.  While I am not a professional, I have taken my time and the quality is evident.  All components are accounted for and all miniatures have been fully assembled with the exception of the dragon boss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wings (to allow for easy storage).
Due to the large number of figures and included components this is a relatively heavy shipment.  Shipping and handling will cost $20.00 and will be shipped out within 24 hours after confirmation of payment.  Additionally, a tracking number will be provided once the package has been shipped.
If you have any additional questions feel free to send me a message via BGG.  I also offer free pickup if buyer is located in Rochester, NY.</notes>
