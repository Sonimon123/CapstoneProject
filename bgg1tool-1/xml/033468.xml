The game is free, fits in your pocket, and the modular board combined with the development cards make it a different game every time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Zombie in my Pocket, you're searching for the secret of the evil temple where you can find the item to destroy the zombies rising from the dead. You can pick up items to bash zombies along the way; a machete, golf club, chain saw, or even your former uncle's grisly femur._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Find the zombie totem, then bury it in the backyard graveyard before midnight and you've saved the world.

    <notes>This is the Print and Play Edition.
I have printed out the game on 110 pound card stock in Color (not the backs) on a Ink-Jet. Then on some nice glossy paper I printed the rules in  Black and White on a Laser-Jet. The game has been constructed (cut out and rules folded). 
In short, this set is ready to play when you get it.
