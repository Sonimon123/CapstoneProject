   <description>In Scotland Yard, one of the players takes on the role of Mr. X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; that is, the remaining players acting in concert _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 125 fare tickets are 5 black, 23 pink underground, 43 green bus,  54 yellow taxi._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Similar to_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The Fury of Dracula_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Clue: The Great Museum Caper_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Ghost Chase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Letters from Whitechapel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Garibaldi: The Escape_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>DODGE AND RACE CORNER AND CHASE
Through the Twisted Streets of London
Get ready for a merry olde chase through Chelsea, the West End, Soho or even Kensington, when you play Scotland Yard . . . a detective game of dogged pursuit and clever estimation.
One player is the mysterious Fugitive X who is trying to evade capture by the Yard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s finest detectives; the other players are the detectives who work as a team to corner and catch X. All players dash through the web of streets travelling from place to place on taxi, bus and underground routes.
To plot a move demands ingenuity, wile and the proper fare. No ticket ... no ride! Try to plan your route several moves in advance to avoid getting hopelessly stranded or cornered.
Taxi, bus or underground? You decide which route is best for fleeing or for following when you play Scotland Yard, the detective game of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fare_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; play!
Contents
1 street map gameboard of London
125 fare tickets
Start cards and special move cards
Plastic logbook and pad
6 clear plastic pawns
1 label sheet
1 storage tray
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the MB edition, box isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t in great shape but does hold together.  Otherwise, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fine, quite playable.  I think there are a few extra tokens in it as well, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s either complete or contains a bonus!  Not a very useful one, but there you go, my sad attempt at marketing.  :)
The actual weight might vary slightly after packing; I just give an honest guess, in this case 3 pounds.  I ship via USPS from zip 80015.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing or handling, and will use the lower of Flat Rate or Priority Mail.

    <notes>The Milton Bradley version from 1985. The box is in good condition, with some corner wear. The pieces and board are in excellent condition (the board still creaks when it’s opened). Some of the pages of blank paper have been used and the cardboard support from which the playing pieces are punched are broken (the 5 player cards wee printed as part of the box on the inside – where the cardboard pieces were punched out, the supports are broken). This is really a fun little game. It doesn’t take much time to play and requires good deductive and planning skills. I just have too many games and need to winnow some out. I’ll ship anywhere in the continental U.S. for $14, and anywhere in the world for shipping plus $2.
I’m selling off most of my games.  If you want a list of all I have for sale, just click on my name (Seller: Too Many Games).
If you want to buy more than one item, I’ll charge the actual shipping cost plus $2 (to cover costs of the packaging etc.).

    <notes>Ravenburger - Scotland Yard (+ FREE koehandel/Tope-La)
Language: English - Dutch - German - French - Italian
3 to 6 players
10 year and older
Duration: about 45 min
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,760 kg
Theme: Which player will have the roll of the elusive Mister X? One player will function as Mister X, with the other players being Scotland Yard detectives searching for him throughout Central London. The starting station cards are shuffled and everyone draws one to determine where they will start the game. Every move is either by taxi, underground, or bus. Mister X moves first and writes his move in his travel log, indicating what method of transportation he used but not where he moved. Then, each detective makes their move, cooperating with the other detectives in an effort to close in on Mister X. Mister X only reveals where he is at certain points in the game, and the chase continues until one of the detectives moves to the place where Mister X is. In this case, the team of detectives has won the game. But, if Mister X makes 24 moves without being caught, he himself wins!

    <notes>Up for sale is a copy of Scotland Yard, it is the 2000 Ravensburger edition.  The game has very minimal wear and tear, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m being conservative when I call this Very Good instead of Like New.  
The game will be shipped via UPS, costs vary with buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s location.  I can ship the package via Priority Mail if preferred, but the charge may be different and the game does not fit into a flat rate box.
Please message me if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like pictures or more info.</notes>

    <notes>This 1985 Milton Bradley version of Scotland Yard is in excellent condition with the box front being in almost perfect condition and the back of the box has minor dishing, but no rips, scuffs, or torn corners.  Great condition for a game its age.  Inside the box it appears to be unplayed with everything present and in like new condition.
Comes from a smoke/pet free environment.
Shipping:  $12
Thanks for looking!
