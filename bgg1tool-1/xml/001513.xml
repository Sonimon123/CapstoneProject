   <description>The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to governor provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Complete and in very good condition.  The box is in great shape (it does have some very small pieces of tape along 4 edges of the box.  Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know why they are there - it looks like the previous owner tried to tape the box shut at some point - not a big deal).  Other than that, everything is here and in great shape.  I will ship Priority mail, so email me with any questions on shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>The game is in very good condition.  It has been played (once, I think) and the counters have been punched.  All components are present.
- The box has wear on the bottom edge, and (less) wear on the upper corners.  There is a 5cm wrinkle on the lower left of the box cover, and a little blueish dirt toward the top.
- The rulebook is in very good condition, with a slight tendency to bend backward and tiny mars on the lower left and lower right back cover.  Otherwise it is clean.
- The cards are all clean, but there is a very slight bend toward the lower right of every card.  I suspect that this was probably a defect in separation at the factory, though I’m not certain.
The board is in good to very good condition.  It is clean, but there are a few white spots in the black areas (probably printing errors, again), and some marring at the fold in the board in the “Active Wars” area.
The six faction/sequence of play cards are all present.  One of them (with the Eagle pennant) is slightly discolored on its left side (from too much exposure to light, I would guess).  A second (with a door/castle pennant) also is discolored on its left side, and has 1 cm rip in the surface of its back.

    <notes>Hi! Thanks for looking. Game + General (AH) magazine 
The game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Republic of Rome_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from Avalon Hill on sale here is definitely in very good condition. The box is only slightly worn at the corners with no splits, and with only some minor indentations on the left side. 
The game has not been played - three dice are included. The contents, that is, counters (unpunched), map, playing cards, rules and so on, are as new.
I am also including the relevant _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;General_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; magazine with the sale (volume 27, Number 4 - the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Republic of Rome_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; issue), which has several articles covering the game. 
This is a good buy and a fair price for anyone wanting the complete game.
I will post anywhere in the world (buyer pays cost). I will use Australia Post with the cost converted to U.S. dollars and cents (exchange rate information via XE.com). 
I accept payment via paypal only, with U.S. currency as the medium of exchange.
Wish you a good purchase!

    <notes>Mostly Punched.  Missing some non-essential chits, including: some black/white number chits (replaced with dice as markers), money counters (replaced with chips), mortality randomizer chits (replaced with 1d30).  All missing chits are easily replaced with dice and chips. (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include the d30 die if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.)
Otherwise complete (i.e. from contents list -- board, all essential counters, all cards, 6 player aids, 3 dice, rulebook, living rules) with all relevant counters accounted for.  Cards show some wear but are in good shape.  All Counters/Cards/Player Aids bagged.  Board in great shape (minor wear on back).  Rules in good shape (a few words written on corner of cover).
While not in perfect shape, this great game is in good condition for it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s age.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve put the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because of the missing chits.</notes>

    <notes>Original box includes Gameboard, Rulebook, 192 Illustrated Action Cards, 6 Faction/Sequence of Play Cards, all the little chits and counters, and 3 Six-Sided Dice (dice not original).  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all in there and ready to go.
Everything has been carefully counted and all cards and pieces are there (possible exception: I did not specifically count all the numerous gold and number pieces, but they should all be there and it would not affect the game if some are missing).
Everything is in Good or Fair shape, with a just few cards and chits being worn or discolored from age.  The manual is particularly worn from use (you will consult it repeatedly when playing this game!).  The box is a bit scuffed and one corner is neatly taped.
Will charge actual, fair cost for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Valley Games, Inc. (VLY 003)
Robert Haines’ and Richard Berthold’s classic game of political intrigue and diplomacy is back in full form!   Republic of Rome is a distillation of 250 years of Roman history, from about 265 B.C., all in one evening!
In Republic of Rome, players are in a constant balancing act between personal advancement and the welfare of the state.  Players build the empire from scratch and thus develop and change the political environment in which they are competing.
Players’ Senators vie for political power, military commands and economic advantages against the backdrop of a turbulent world.  Deals and counter-offers abound. Short the necessary votes for Consul? Trade the Armaments Concession for a faction’s support. Spartacus has destroyed your villa?  Send Pompey off with ten legions to crush him. But is that too much power to entrust to one man? What if Pompey rebels and marches on Rome?
The game contains three scenarios which divide the color-coded cards into decks simulating the Early, Middle, and Late Republic. Those wishing a larger game can combine them into a Campaign Game of truly epic proportions. A solitaire and two-player version are also included for those unable to muster more players.</notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill version punched and great shape, contents have been verified as complete. Everything is neatly packed. The only thing wrong with the game is that the instruction booklet has a 2-3 stain on the side of the booklet extending into the booklet about 1/2 inch. All text and graphics are readable but the it looks like a stain. There is also some water staining on the back page. Otherwise it is good to go.
Feel free to ask for more info/details.

    <notes>Untouched, crisp, even the box . . .The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history. It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic. The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate. They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents. To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome. While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained. A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t go down under this pressure. If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!</notes>

    <notes>1990 Avalon Hill Edition.  I purchased it unpunched and punched out the tokens (carefully) but have never had a chance to play it.  Great condition for its age.  I also will include a printed copy of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;living rules_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the original box though).  Finally, I found a great Plano case that fits in the original box and stores the components: you can have it for an extra $7.
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the storage container included and add the additional cost to the total.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Use: Game un-played.
Components Overall condition:  Near Mint. Counters punched. Plus there is a copy of the General Vol 27 #4 kept in plastic (its a little wavy from being in the box, but is otherwise in Good condition) and several printouts of downloads from the Internet - looks like sequence of play and play aids plus rules clarifications.
Box Condition: Box is in Good condition. Some scuffing on the bottom and someone used tape on the sides and bottom to keep the box closed at some point. There is a small area on the bottom where the tape peeled away the image. No splits.
Shipping: Will ship to the United States only. I will ship USPS Flat Rate. Please geekmail me with your zip code so I can determine shipping costs. I will combine orders if possible.
Payment: Pay-pal only please.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, punched and neatly bagged, but never played.  Fairly heavy box so cheapest shipping would be Medium Flat Rate Priority - $12.35 in the US, $40.95 shipping to Canada, and $59.95 for anywhere else in the world.
I can always try to see if there is a cheaper international shipping option - just message me!</notes>

    <notes>Much superior Avalon Hill edition (I hate the Valley Games Photoshop explosion, makes it look like a video game. Yuck!).
But enough editorializing, this copy is unplayed, even the cards still have plastic wrap, and box is near perfect.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>Game is punched, but I believe unplayed. I traded for this copy, but it looks like the previous owner just punched and bagged everything, then traded it away. Shipping will be determined by the location of the buyer--expect to pay actual shipping. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry--if shipping is too high, we can always cancel the order.</notes>

    <notes>Unpunched, unplayed, complete. Box would be nearly perfect except for a gash in the front face I discovered after putting it up for sale. (crap!)
This game has been a shelf decoration all it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s life. Some cards look slightly dog-eared and I found one card with a bit of disintegrated rubber band adhered on, because AH couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be bothered to provide a good storage solution for them. Cards are currently in plastic card holder boxes.</notes>

    <notes>So, back in 2008 I preordered a copy of Republic of Rome to my parents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; address in Canada.  Moving to the UK, I never got to collect it, and bought one there instead.  Eventually, after many delays, my original copy arrived and remained in its delivery box until March 2016.  Still in shrink wrap, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got no need for a second copy of this fantastic game--so here it is, for sale!
Currently in Canada, and will be passing through North Bay / Ottawa in the very unlikely chance there are buyers in those areas who_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to avoid shipping charges.  When back in the UK, can arrange for delivery in person at LoB or Croydon Board Gamers; or other London locations, possibly. 
The game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t small (and the box so full it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t shut properly; about 11inx 13inx 4in) and heavy (just under 6 pounds) so shipping cost internationally may be prohibitive.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve therefore listed it for domestic shipping only, which at the moment is Canada/US.  When I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve returned to the UK I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll edit the listing for UK/EU.  
International buyers, if interested, feel free to contact me but when I checked Canada Post online, shipping costs were well over $100 CDN.  (Or a bit under if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind waiting three months for surface shipping.)</notes>

    <notes>1990 Avalon Hill Edition.  Box is slightly worn on front, and rulebook has small amount of water damage, otherwise all parts are complete and in very good condition.  This is a fantastic game, historically accurate and with a great mechanic that forces players to cooperate in order to survive but work against each other to win.</notes>

    <notes>Still in shrink! This is the only one I have ever seen (and probably that I will ever see). There cannot be that many left in the world as the game is 25-year old. As Indiana Jones would say, it belongs to a museum!
Shame that I have to sell it but I need the space and I own two other copies of this wonderful game.</notes>
