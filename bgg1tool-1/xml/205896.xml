   <description>Rising Sun is a spiritual successor in the same mythic big box series as Blood Rage: same designer, same artist, same studio and same sculptors._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rising Sun is a game about honor, negotiation, and warfare in a feudal Japan where the ancient gods (kami) have returned to rebuild the empire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Whereas the distant ancestor of Blood Rage was Risk, Rising Sun claims Diplomacy as its distant ancestor. Tackle negotiations, alliances, and war. Capture hostages and commit seppuku. The game features an honor track, which rises and falls based on your actions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I need the money more than I need the game - up for sale is my pre-shipped Kickstarter pledge at the Daimyo level (the only level) containing the Rising Sun core box, Daimyo box, Kami Unbound expansion, and Monster Pack. If the pledge manager is still open at the time of sale, I can try to add on extras at cost. Available extras are the Playmat Board ($30), Artbook ($25), Metal Coin Pack ($20), Dynasty Invasion expansion ($50), and even an extra copy of the game ($100). Shipping is already paid on this game, but if we add on extras I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to add a few dollars for the extra shipping fee.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve set the price only slightly higher than you would have paid at the time of the campaign. I have every expectation that the game will be both amazing and beautiful, but rent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gone up and that takes priority. Shipping has already been paid, and as such I can only ship domestically in the US. I prefer payment methods that do not charge a fee to the buyer or seller, such as Venmo or Amazon.com gift card. PayPal offers a feeless payment system (Send Money to Friends - you can be the judge on whether applying this system to a BGG purchase is OK in your book), but if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to use Paypal Pay For Goods I would ask you to cover their fee.</notes>

    <notes>I need the money more than I need the game - up for sale is my pre-shipped Kickstarter pledge at the Daimyo level (the only level) containing the Rising Sun core box, Daimyo box, Kami Unbound expansion, and Monster Pack. If the pledge manager is still open at the time of sale, I can try to add on extras at cost. Available extras are the Playmat Board ($30), Artbook ($25), Metal Coin Pack ($20), Dynasty Invasion expansion ($50), and even an extra copy of the game ($100). Shipping is already paid on this game, but if we add on extras I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to add a few dollars for the extra shipping fee.
Please note that I ordered two copies of the game and am selling the 2nd of 2.

Kami Unbound, Daimyo Box, and Monster Pack as well as base game.
I still have the box CMON shipped it in so it fits perfectly with foam padding. I live in Missouri, I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be about $30-38 to get it shipped somewhere in the U.S, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship it wherever you pay shipping.

Kickstarter version of Rising Sun with all the Stretch goals . 
Punched and organized into the core and Daimyo box as designed . Does not contain the two expansion boxes as those have spaces in daimyo box.
Please note that the duckaiju / Godzilla figure is painted . Look here for details : https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4041222
If you don’t want the Godzilla figure I would be willing to let this go for 160

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter Edition of Rising Sun and includes ALL exclusives mentioned on the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Kickstarter page. Please visit the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s KS page for full details. 
The game has been played twice and is in excellent condition.
That means:
Rising Sun (with both plastic upgraded pieces and original cardboard pieces)
Daimyo Box
Kami Unbound
Monster Expansion
This also includes the neoprene mat, which replicates the board at 20% larger size for bigger games. Finally, this includes the Dynasty Invasion expansion, which adds two new factions and other content. 
You will pay shipping, which I expect to be $30-50. My family member owns a mailing store, so I can get a discount. 
To be transparent: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking for $100 over the cost of what I paid on the KS (which was $200 total). I think that is reasonable considering the sheer volume of content and miniatures in the game and exclusives. Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>$215 total to ship the single box somewhere in the U.S.
$245 if you want me to repackage the whole thing and ship it all inside the U.S.
-Kickstarter Daimyo pledge with:
  -All Stretch Goals (Monster Pack, Kami...etc.)
  -Dynasty Invasion Expansion
-Played only once.
-I kept all boxes, but packing it all up separately and shipping them will cost a lot more. I fit all of it in the base game box, though it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t quite close (about 1/2 inch of box lift, as shown in the pictures). I can separate it out again and ship all boxes, or just ship the main box, your choice. Will ship just the base box (with everything from the KS pledge inside, but no inserts) for $20, but instead add $50 if you want me to repackage and ship it all.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter Daimyo Pledge (no paid for add-ons though). Only played once but not really suitable for my game group. 
I have disposed of some of the game box plastic packaging and bagged all the components as I was going to buy a custom insert to hold all the pieces but I haven’t got round to that yet. I have still kept the plastic inserts to hold the monsters though. 
Components all in great condition. 
P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P to a U.K. address is £6 (probably will cost more than this but I’ll absorb the extra cost as I’m wanting a quick sale)
Kami Unbound and Monster Pack not included and available separately from me. 
PayPal or Bank Transfer payment. 
Let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Hi,
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling brand-new (in shrink) Rising Sun, Kickstarter Daimyo Pledge.
The Pledge contains:
- 1x Base Game
- 1x Daimyo Box
- 1x Kami Unbound
- 1x Monster Pack
Important note 1: The Daimyo Box I received has a tiny dent - but still. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s why I made a complain and received a new one. Please note that if you buy from me you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get Daimyo box in a shrink with a tiny dent AND Daimyo Box without a shrink, in perfect condition as a replacement (2 boxes together)
Important note 2: (regarding shipping) Because of my holiday there might be a little delay in shipping. If you buy the game between 24.07.2018 and 5.08.2017 it will be shipped on 6 ot 7th of August. If you buy it in the timespan from 8.08 till 9.09 then the shipping will take place after 12.09. Dates may vary from the given above.
If you are willing to buy and would like to get more details, send me a message.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the kickstarter Daimyo pledge.  I have opened the Kami Unbound box and combined it in the Daimyo box.  I looked at everything, but never played the game.  I also have the metal coins and they are included.
Shipping will be expensive because the boxes are big and heavy.  Id guess around $40.  From 48188 (Michigan)</notes>

Shipping to the continental US only. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge $35 for shipping and eat the rest of the cost if it is more (or refund you if it is less, but this is very unlikely). Can also do local pickup from the central Maryland area.</notes>

Buyer pays shipping from 40504 or 45202, note that there will be two packages due to the playmat. Local pickup also available in Lexington, KY or Cincinnati, OH. PM me if you want to set something up. Exchange will be made in a public place.
Ships to US only - I am willing to consider offers from elsewhere in the world but please be forewarned that shipping outside the US is often very expensive.</notes>

    <notes>Hello,
I am interested in selling a game and its subsequent expansions/additions. All items are still shrink wrapped.
This is a great opportunity for anyone who missed the KS campaign for game content and would like to own a fairly complete collection of expansions and add-on on top of the base game. I am located in Quebec, Canada for location purposes. Price is negotiable.
Rising Sun (100$ USD, negotiable)
Condition:
Brand new, never played
Includes all game boxes
Including:
Rising Sun Core Box
Daimyo Box
Phoenix Exclusive Monster
All unlocked Stretch Goals

ORG074    Broken Token Daimyo Collection Organizer
All Cards Sleeved with Fantasy Flight Games Sleeves
This was from the Kickstarter the only thing I did not purchase was the art book. I built the Broken Token Organizer and placed all contents into their respective locations including sleeving all the cards with Fantasy Flight Games Sleeves. I am simply selling because I have not had a chance yet to play this game. There is a lot of content here and I would rather someone who wants to play this game have a chance. Due to the size and amount of boxes I am willing to cover the shipping costs.
Thanks!</notes>
