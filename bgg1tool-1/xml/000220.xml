   <description>In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).  While bidding, though, keep an eye on your remaining cash - at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn't even considered for victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2003 re-published by Überplay._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2003 published with a new theme by Amigo as Einfach Tierisch._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2006, published by University Games as Animalement V_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ocirc;tre (French version) and Beestenveiling (Dutch version)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2008, re-published by Eagle-Gryphon Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2018, re-published by Osprey Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;I would easily say that High Society is the best auction filler I have..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;In many ways it is the best Knizia design of all._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  Mike Siggins, Game Designer It is one thing to be the richest family on the block, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quite another to flaunt it successfully. High Society pits you against your neighbors in a race to reveal the most blue-blooded family in your midst. To win, you must acquire all the trappings of great wealth, avoid as many of the pitfalls as you can and still walk away with a huge pile of cash at the end of it all. This Reiner Knizia classic makes a great travel game and an easy one to introduce to friends and family. 
Originally published in 1995, High Society gained sufficient popularity to see it through 3 re-prints none of them as beautiful as the latest FRED Edition. Artist Paul Niemeyer has done an outstanding job creating a theme to reflect the most elite fineries of the Gilded Age, and combined with FRED_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commitment to quality components and card stocks, this edition of High Society will stand as the pinnacle of its production. 
For 3-5 players over 10 years old, this 30-45 minute game can be played as a light filler between longer games, but we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be honest with you: this one is very hard to put back in the box! The cards tells an exciting story and feature beautiful artwork from well-known Eagle Games artist Paul Niemeyer. 
  Game Summary:
Players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth, namely the ten luxury possession (positive-number) and three 2X multiplier cards; while avoiding its pitfalls represented by three cards altogether, including the gambling (-5) card; the thief (lose a possession) card; and the calamitous fire (lose ½ the value of all your possession cards) card. While bidding, though, players must keep an eye on their remaining cash at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even considered for victory. This dual-objective creates a nail-biting auction experience, and one that will surely become a favorite edition for a generation of gamers to come.

    <notes>Gryphon Games - Bookshelf Game #5: High Society
Language: English (Language Independent)
Players: 3 to 5
Age: 10+
Duration: 30 to 45 min 
Weight: 0.440 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: In Reiner Knizia_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards). While bidding, though, keep an eye on your remaining cash - at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even considered for victory.
See Details (more info) or below for complete selling, payment and shipping conditions.

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101083N)
It is one thing to be the richest family on the block... it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s quite another to flaunt it successfully. High Society pits you against your neighbors in a race to reveal the most blue-blooded family in your midst. To win, you must acquire all the trappings of great wealth, avoid as many of the pitfalls as you can and still walk away with a huge pile of cash at the end of it all. This Reiner Knizia classic makes a great travel game and an easy one to introduce to friends and family. Originally published in 1995, High Society gained sufficient popularity to see it through 3 re-prints... none of them as beautiful as the latest FRED Edition. Artist Paul Niemeyer has done an outstanding job creating a theme to reflect the most elite fineries of the Gilded Age, and combined with FRED_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commitment to quality components and card stocks, this edition of High Society will stand as the pinnacle of its production. </notes>

    <notes>Reserved for user _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Seabear2000_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Ravensburger 1995 edition, German rules, printout of English rules translation.  Cards are language-independent.  
Box has some minor edge wear.  Cards are in excellent condition.
SHIPPING:
   USA: $8.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>Hey it seems as though you lost the other auctions you may have been bidding on. I have no problem shipping this to you but im also flexable. I know you can get this in the geek market for $5 and they may only charge $1 for shipping so if its would be more than $6 to include shipping from me I have no problem holding on to it. Just let me know and thank you for your bid. Just let me know if you want to go through with it.
