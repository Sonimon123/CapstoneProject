   <description>StreetSoccer is the name in the Netherlands (Dutch: Straatvoetbal) for how soccer is played in parks or squares in cities and villages._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this game 2 StreetSoccer teams play a 25 'minute' match. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The soccer field is 10 spaces long and 6 wide (plus spaces outside the lines)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2 players of this game both are coaches of one team. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Both coaches have 5 StreetSoccer player figures (incl. the goalie). _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A die determines your number of spaces to move one of your figures. If you reach the ball you shoot the ball by the unused number of pips on the die plus one, and can make passes between players of your team. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The die makes luck a part of this game. But your choices, like which player you move to which field and where to pass the ball are very important. For the following turns you calculate chances for your opponent and yourself and you try to have your players in good positions for later situations._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>Shrinkwrap removed but never played. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money. Shipping weight is 5 pounds.</notes>
