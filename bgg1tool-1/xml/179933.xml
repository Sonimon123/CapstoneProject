   <description>The sky breaks blue and bright over a mouth-watering field of obstacles. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ve adopted, loved, and trained your team of Agility Dogs to share in the joys of a day just like this. Their exuberance is catching as they prepare to breathtakingly weave the poles, sail over hurdles, blast through tunnels, round corners at top speed with fur a-tussle, and harness lightning while waiting for your cue on the trust-testing pause box. Your Husky's glacier blue eyes are clear and focused, your Golden Retriever mirrors the sun with radiant energy, and the feisty little Jack Russell pup is ready to run with the big dogs. Test your wit and instincts in this two-player game of vision and versatility!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Agility applies a unique mechanic in which cards that supply resources also select actions. On your turn, you play a Training Card that provides one of two types of resources in varying quantities while also granting an action building off of what your opponent just played. This encourages clever planning and timing. Training you need may be at odds with the action you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;d like, so weighing your options will be crucial. Resources may be used to adopt dogs or to clear obstacles on the three courses you've drafted from the six available each game. Courses can only be claimed once a dog is adopted, so there is a race within a race to snatch up Wonderdogs or Underdogs well suited to the available courses. Then it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s nip and tuck as the canine competitors bound over, under, and through to the finish lines!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>
