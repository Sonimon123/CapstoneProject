   <description>The old dragon Drakon has captured a brave band of adventurers who have sneaked into her lair to steal her gold. But rather than eat them immediately, Drakon has decided to make it a game: Greed shall set one of the adventurers free. She sends the frightened adventurers into her magical, mad vaulted chambers, and the first one to collect ten gold from Drakon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s maze gets to go free. The rest get to be lunch._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, players must choose one of two options: (1) place a tile from their hand onto the board, expanding the dungeon; or (2) move their Hero to an adjacent tile. Many of the dungeon tiles have an icon that allows players entering that space to take a special action (for example, taking a piece of gold from the dragon's hoard, stealing gold from another player, or destroying a tile that is already in play)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is the third edition of Drakon, and includes the following updates:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    plastic miniatures are used for the heroes and the Drakon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    new tiles are larger (measuring 2.5 by 2.5 inches) and have all new artwork_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    tiles include a combination of rooms from Drakon (second edition) and Drakon Expansion 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    new rules, variants, and player aids are provided_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    each gold piece now has a value between 1 and 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the basic game, the first player to earn 10 gold wins the game.

    <notes>New/sealed item! Fast shipping! Pay via paypal to maydaygames@gmail.com or save 2% by paying to existingfunds@sphiatt.com instead with existing paypal funds. Buyer to pay just $6.95 shipping!
Yes we can combine shipping on multiple items! Save even more!
Yes we can combine orders at significant shipping discounts.
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Combined shipping works as follows for domestic (48 lower states) orders:
Highest price shipping item: Full shipping cost
2nd-4th highest priced items: 50% off shipping cost for each of these items.
5th-10th highest priced shipping items: 60% off shipping costs for each of these items.
11th+ highest priced shipping items: 75% off shipping for all the rest of the items.
As an example say you purchased 15 games, 3 of them with $10 shipping, 5 of them with $8 shipping and 7 of them with $4 shipping. The total shipping for the 15 items would be:
Full shipping on the first item: $10.00
50% off shipping on items 2-4: $14.00 (50% off $10, $10 and $8, the next highest shipping cost items)
60% off shipping on items 5-10: $14.40 (60% off of 3 items at $8 shipping and 3 more items at $4 shipping = $36)
75% off shipping on items 11-15: $4.00 (75% off 4 items at $4)
Total shipping on these 15 items then would be $10+$14+$14.40 + $4 = $42.40 shipping. This is just an example and your results will vary depending on what you buy of course!</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - Drakon 3rd Edition
Language: English
Players: 2 to 6
Age: 10+
Duration: 20 to 60 min
Weight: 1.000 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The old dragon Drakon has captured a brave band of adventurers who have sneaked into her lair to steal her gold. But rather than eat them immediately, Drakon has decided to make it a game: Greed shall set one of the adventurers free. She sends the frightened adventurers into her magical, mad vaulted chambers, and the first one to collect ten gold from Drakon’s maze gets to go free. The rest get to be lunch. Each turn, players must choose one of two options: (1) place a tile from their hand onto the board, expanding the dungeon; or (2) move their Hero to an adjacent tile. Many of the the dungeon tiles have an icon that allows players entering that space to take a special action (for example, taking a piece of gold from the dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hoard, stealing gold from another player, or destroying a tile that is already in play).
This is the third edition of Drakon, and includes the following updates:
plastic miniatures are used for the heroes and the Drakon 
new tiles are larger (measuring 2.5 by 2.5 inches) and have all new artwork 
tiles include a combination of rooms from Drakon (2nd Edition) and Drakon Expansion 1 
new rules, variants, and player aids are provided 
each gold piece now has a value between 1 and 3 
In the basic game, the first player to earn 10 gold wins the game. Some variants provide different winning conditions.
See Details (more info) or below for complete selling, payment and shipping conditions.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Drakon (FFG Silver Line Edition)
Description: Mint, sealed
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>  DRAKON (3rd Edition) very lightly used and in great shape. Tiles and figures are pretty much mint. Box is in great shape as well. I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mark the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; just because the game wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t exactly recently removed from shrink, but it is in fantastic shape.
  As noted in the BGG forums, yes, the floor tiles do have a strange smell due to the thick ink used in printing. I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t realize that this was normal, so I bought another one which ended up having the exact same smell. Hence, I now own two of them and need to sell one!
This 3rd edition is very collectable as the game is now completely out of print.</notes>

    <notes>Drakon 3rd Edition.
Fantasy Flight 3rd Edition.  Great Condition.  Fun game, just trying to reduce the amount of games I have on my shelf. 
Buyer prepays plus USPS priority mail shipping.  If I can find a different box, or you order many games, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to combine shipping or make a special trip to the post office for parcel post, but for just a couple games, or a single game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to use the free boxes for priority mail.  
If we can beat flat rate depending upon your location, we will, but many times flat rate does tend to be the least expensive. </notes>

Condition
---
The box and all game components are in perfect condition.  The game has been adult-owned and kept in a non-smoking home.
Components
---
All game components and manuals are present and are undamaged.
Shipping
---
I will ship this via USPS in a flat rate box (I think it will fit), to the USA only for $10 (bringing the order total to $70). If you are outside of the US and really want this game, feel free to drop me a GM, and we can discuss it. I only hesitate because I rarely ship out of the country. Free pickup is available if you happen to be in Albuquerque, NM.
Payment
---
I accept payment through Paypal only. Please do not send payment to my personal email address (the one listed when you make the purchase). I will provide a Paypal address to use when I confirm the sale.</notes>
