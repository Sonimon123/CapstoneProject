   <description>Play is in teams of two. Each person has a deck of picture cards. Each deck has the same set of pictures. There is also a deck of word cards with words like _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;marriage_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;de facto_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pimple_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A word is chosen and each player chooses 2-5 cards from his/her deck.

    <notes>Older Mattel version that handles six players. A couple of the decks look like they were never used; for the remainder of the decks, a few cards in each deck look handled and they are bowed compared to the rest of the cards, but this probably wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be a big deal during play.
All decks are complete and all topic cards and tokens are included. The box is somewhat banged up, but the board is untouched and lies flat.
Please write for shipping costs for a small box by your preferred shipping method to wherever you live. Or write for more details about the condition of cards if you want more details.</notes>

    <notes>This is an unplayed six-player edition.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the same condition as the day I bought it.  The cards, board, and tokens are all in unplayed, shiny condition.  The box is also in shiny condition.  But there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some general shelf wear.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to you by whatever method you prefer. Alternatively, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to meet up with you in the Washington, DC area to save on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>The very desirable Mattel 6-player version of a family favorite. Still in its original shrink wrap. Never opened. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money. Shipping weight is 5 pounds.</notes>

Cover _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; bottom are scuffed but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not very noticeable at first glance as the color and overall finish are intact, though the edges are worst than the rest. Cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; markers are still in shrink-wrap. Purple insert is flimsy and partially crushed - I received it this way. (See picture)</notes>
