   <description>Individual battles between famous Star Wars characters set on different board locations. Players choose a major character that is accompanied by one or two minor characters. Each set of characters has its own deck of cards which are used for attack, defense, or special abilities. Each deck is unique with certain special powers relevant to the major character. There are different modes of play; one-on-one battles, up to three teams can play against each other, or up to six players can play a free-for-all battle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battle fields included are Geonosis Arena, Emperor's Throne Room, Carbon-Freezing Chamber, and Kamino Platform. The game includes 31 decorated figures from across the entire Star Wars spectrum, 12 character cards (which have major and minor character life trackers on them), 378 action cards (31 per character group), 4 battle field boards, 1 movement die, wound markers, and rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is generally in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition with the exception of some tape on the box lid.  All miniatures are present and in like new condition.  All cards are present and in like new condition.  The movement die, wound tokens, and battle boards are all present and in like new condition.  The only downside is that the Darth Maul character chart is missing (although the entire Darth Maul card deck and miniature ARE both present).  This is the only thing keeping this from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; category.  If you feel that the price is still too high, then make a serious offer.  I can be flexible.
Buyer will pay exact shipping cost via USPS parcel post or priority mail (it all depends on how quickly you want your new game).  No bogus handling charges or other surplus shipping charges.  You pay what I pay.  If you live outside the USA, I can consider your offer, but shipping will cost you more (maybe considerably more).
PayPal is the preferred payment method but I will take a money order and a check (if you can wait for the check to clear before shipping).</notes>

History on this copy.  I acquired it from a family who apparently opened it, looked at it, and put it in the closet.  They obviously never played it, because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unpunched and figures aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t unwrapped.  Cards were strewn about in the box, I sorted and counted them buy hand to confirm that they are all there.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve already got my own personal copy, so this gem gets to go to someone else!  Enjoy!
Shipping should be about 13.00 with insurance included.
Shipping info:
Will ship in separate box with bubble wrap and/peanuts, etc.
Will ship after paid in full, checks and MOs accepted, but paypal preferred. Shipping and handling is covered by buyer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send you quotes and you can pick what kind of shipping you want. Insurance is not optional, and thus will be included in my quote.  At this price for a game, the dollar thirty-five is no big deal, since I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not responsible for anything once I mail the game.
Any questions or comments message me with no hesitation!

    <notes>Box lid is a little squashed (about 1/3 of my game collection was sitting on top of it) but everything inside is accounted for and in good shape.  From a non-smoking home.  Buyer pays actual cost of USPS priority shipping. I accept PayPal.

    <notes>Here is a phenomenal copy of this very excellent game!
All the figures are present and in original, completely unopened bubble wrap packaging!
All cards are still unopened in their original shrinkwrap, and all stickers, maps, tokens and character charts are completely unpunched and untouched!
The box has obviously been unwrapped to verify the above items, but even the box is in premium condition!
Overall this is an excellent chance for you to find an unplayed, unpunched copy of this very rare game!</notes>

    <notes>Played a couple of times, contents still in excellent condition.  All figures verified complete.
I only downgraded to acceptable due to the following error I discovered upon counting the cards. I have only 30 cards for the Obi-Wan deck and 32 cards for the Luke/Leia deck, whereas all the rest are 31.  This must have been a factory error, but I never noticed before.
The box is in excellent condition with a bit of minor scuffing on the bottom edges.</notes>

    <notes>Game looks in played condition. Everything looks great, I bagged all the cards and boxed the minis when I got it. No broken pieces as far as I can tell. When I inventoried the cards I think there were two cards missing (unless I lost count), but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell if those are playing cards or player aid cards, of which there are 6. Everything else is pristine, including the box which shows very little wear. I can re-inventory the cards exactly for a serous buyer. 
I can meet in the GTA for exchange for those interested.</notes>

Also included is a nearly-correct extra Boba Fett deck (missing 1 card but has 1 extra card). (There is a correct Boba Fett deck as well.) The cards show very light signs of use - a few faint scratches and so forth. Otherwise the components are in find shape.
The insert that is supposed to hold the decks (which no one ever uses) is missing. The box has very slight indentation and minor wear.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling a very good condition copy of Epic Duels.  The box has very minor creasing on the top with a very slight paper (not structure) damage to one corner.  The paper is worn through at one spot. They wrapped the box with a thin paper that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t store well.  Besides that little point, the box has great color and still retains its gloss.  Inside the box all of the cards are individually bagged, all of the figurines are present, and the player boards are in unplayed condition.  Rules are in there, so it is a complete game that could be considered like new if it were not for the corner of the box.
Comes from a smoke/pet free home.
Shipping is $14.
Thanks for looking and have a great day!

    <notes>Complete and perfect except for minor shelf wear.  Verified to be 100% complete.  Each set of characters/cards is stored in their own baggie for convenient setup.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 64oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.

    <notes>Item Name: Star Wars: Epic Duels
Description: Star Wars: Epic Duels used, complete with components sorted and bagged.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>All the characters are intact, all the cards, character sheets, and game boards are included. 
A few of the cardboard damage trackers are missing, however, there are enough to play a 4 player game with any combination of characters. 
Some wear and tear on the box from years of use.
You pay shipping, cost is negotiable, simply never play and would like to sell a few games in my collection to make room for others.</notes>

Acceptable. This one kills me. Purchased new for my son. He played with it several times, usually just with the figures. Box has typical shelf wear but no stains and corners are intact. All figures present, but Yoda and Anakin have broken lightsabers. The gameboards are in perfect shape. THe character cards are in perfect shape. The die is in perfect shape. The cheap insert, which was sold new taped together, needs retaped. The decks are stored in deck boxes and the cards are clean. The wound markers are all here, along with the quick guide cards. So far, not bad at all, right?
But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing cards. Oof. All characters should have 31 cards. A count revealed:
Anakin, 30
Boba Fett, 14 (Ouch)
Count Dooku, 31
Darth Maul, 29
Darth Vader, 23
Emperor Palpatine, 28
Han Solo, 27
Jango Fett, 31
Luke Skywalker, 30
Mace Windu, 29
Obi-Wan Kenobi, 18 (Sigh)
Yoda, 30
All in all, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a playable copy. The decks can be found cheaply on eBay. The 2 figures with broken sabers can be replaced via eBay as well.

    <notes>Functionally complete. The cards are in very good condition: very little wear.
Contains all 31 of 31 miniatures.
The Character Cards have been verified 100% complete: the correct 31 cards for each of the 12 characters.
2 of the 6 identical _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Quick Guide_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; reference cards are missing.
The manual is a replacement: a print-out of a pdf.
One of the 12 Character Charts (the Emperor) is a replacement: a full-color print-out on cardstock. Perfectly functional. The other 11 charts are original and present.
Only has 5 of the 28 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wound markers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just tiny, cheap, identical little tokens used to mark a position on a track. These can be replaced with any cube or even a dime or penny or whatever.
Box has SUBSTANTIAL wear, caving, creases, repaired corner.</notes>

[b]Condition:[/b] Good. The box has a decently large dent on one end. The cards are curving lengthwise, but otherwise don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look significantly played with (not sure if this is a manufacturing defect or due to play). Components verified complete. The only insert present is a cardboard tray, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if there ever was more than that. Rules look unread.</notes>
