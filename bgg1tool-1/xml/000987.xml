   <description>Kingmaker simulates the Wars of the Roses, the period of sporadic Civil War in England between 1450 and 1490. Ruled by a weak and mentally unstable king, Henry VI, demoralized by the defeat in France at the end of the Hundred Years War, and encouraged by the ambitions of Richard, Duke of York, and his sons; the country's Noble families used their large private armies in attempts to gain control of the government._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is based on the premise that the powerful Noble families used the Lancastrian and Yorkist princes as pawns in a greater game of gaining control of England. Players control factions using their military and political power to control and influence the royal heirs, supporting the heir in their control as king while trying to take down all of the other heirs._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 7_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1976 AH Edition = 126 counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1974 Ariel = 38 counters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the 1976 AH version. Box has very minor scuffing on corners. Components in very good condition EXCEPT: 1 ship _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 1 yellow city control marker: these were chewed on a little by my old dog (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;bad dog!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;). You can still play with them, but they ain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t pretty. Would be easy to make replacement counter for the ship; replacing the city control marker is probably not even necessary. Buyer to pay actual shipping costs + $1, sent USPS. Payment via paypal or check/money order in $USD.</notes>

    <notes>The classic game in its first incarnation, the 1974 Ariel first printing.  Same size big map as AH_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;s second edition.  With a little effort (a few extra cards, in particular), should be readily adaptable to AH first and second edition rules.
Very minor damage to the box, including a faint ink scribble (see photo).  The map has spontaneously bubbled in the sea off of Cornwall --no consequence.  Components look like new.</notes>

Game appears to be complete EXCEPT for missing one of the optional/advanced game crown cards, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Kings Pardon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. There is however a blank crown card that you could easily use as a substitute.</notes>

The PC manuals are helpful for background and some further information on the general game play - even of the for sale board game.  Everything is in excellent unplayed, crisp card condition.

    <notes>Avalon Hill, 1976.  Box shows some shelf wear.  Rules show some wear along the spine.  Board, cards and pieces in playable condition, but show considerable wear from repeated play.  Inventoried - all parts present. Includes expansion set of event cards (a considerable improvement in play).  Shipping and insurance paid by buyer, estimated $15.00 to US (more outside US) - contact me for exact shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>This is the first edition box. (Green/Black)
Missing 1 counter, (Margaret of Anjou). Important for gameplay, but could easily be replaced with almost anything, or a suitable replacement counter made, (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m working on that).
Box is starting to show a bit of lid-dishing, but there are not yet the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;corner creases_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Some liquid was obviously spilled in the box lid, as there is a stain. Box shows standard shelf scuff.</notes>

    <notes>1976 Avalon Hill edition. Game is in excellent condition, having been played only twice. Cards and counters are complete (I counted and pushed counters back into spaces in original counter sheet to verify this). Box has slight wear from storage, but is otherwise in excellent shape, with no split corners. I also have the variant event cards for this classic game for sale, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested: check my other listings.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill 1976 edition. Box has some scuffing, consistent with storage, but is not split, torn or repaired in any way. All cards are present, verified against inventories here on the Geek. All noble, ship and royal heir counters are present. Game is missing one green and one white faction counter, but this is not critical to game to play. Other than those two missing counters, game is 100% complete. Game cards show some wear and yellowing due to use and age.</notes>

    <notes>2nd edition. Box shows just a little shelfwear. Inside everything there, all counters unpunched all cards unseperated.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

Components are in great shape.  However, the box has one split corner and obvious shelfwear.
Payment Notes:
Non-US buyers will have to pay via Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) (as it is the only way that I can assure that there will not be any funny business) unless you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks.  You must also have zero negative BGG Marketplace feedbacks and zero negative BGG Trade feedbacks in which case I would be able to accept a Paypal payment.  But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
US buyers: USPS money order is preferred. 
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks.  You must also have zero negative BGG Marketplace feedbacks and zero negative BGG Trade feedbacks.  But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card. 
If the receiver elects not to pay extra for insurance (totally up to you) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers: Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.</notes>

The sheet listing the variant cards is missing, but should be easily replaceable. In any case, the cards are not that difficult to work out!

    <notes>Game in nearly perfect condition. I never played it. Bought a lot of a dozen games and only wanted one of them.
Card are punched, but have never been shuffled. Looks like the game was punched out put on a shelf and never played. Only wear is on the box and there is very little. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this rulebook or board has ever been opened.
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really know anything about the editions this game went through. It was copyrighted in 1976, and there is a band across the lower right corner saying, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Featuring 2nd edition rules and mapboard._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 
Can send pictures, you will not be displeased with the condition of this game.
I can look up the costs of shipping with your zip code to give you an exact price for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Avalon Hill, 1976 - Kingmaker (2nd edition) - COMPLETE/SEALED. Outer Box is still originally sealed. Shrinkwrap is tight all around box. Excellent condition.  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will ship in usps flat rate box with delivery confirmation ($11.75) or weigh around 3.5 pounds (for overseas estimate) once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon</notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill first edition game.
This particular game has been played a couple of times and there is definite wear and tear, but overall the game box and components are still in good shape.
The outer box shows sign of wear and tear.  Nothing is split or bent or damaged.  At the edges, white is starting to show through the colors.
The board is in very good shape.  The rules are in good shape.  They have certainly been looked through many times, but still intact and not falling apart.  The last page (pages 23-24) is beginning to split along the side.
All game playing components have been accounted for and are present: all printed Crown Deck cards, all printed Event Deck cards, and all cardboard counters.
There are a few missing non-game playing components.  Here is the complete list:
1) The one blank Crown Deck Card,
2) The many blank Event Deck Cards,
3) The two clips that hold the board together.</notes>

    <notes>Kingmaker (1976) from Avalon Hill
Box: Light shelf-wear and a few dings. One corner of the top is split, and another corner is split along the seam for about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but the corner is not split and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very sturdy. Overall the box is in very good condition!
Contents: The cards are all here and in excellent condition. The board is in great shape. The rules have some light to moderate wear and a bunch of places where things are underlined or circled. Is is totally readable and in very good condition overall. The main counters are all here (the nobles, royalty, and ships) and in excellent condition. The generic territory marker counters, however, are mostly missing and have been replaced with different counters. The original counters with the portcullis are here, but the others are not. Included is a full set of colored chits (most unpunched) that will fill in perfectly. This will have no effect on gameplay, and in fact, may make it easier to tell which areas each player controls. This is a definitely a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy but also a great way to get the game at a reduced value.
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Gibson edition - complete played with a couple of times but very good condition.
I will throw in the Avalon Hill PC game as well if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested - it comes on 3.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; floppies and runs under DOS so I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t vouch for you being able to get it to work, but it did the last time I tried some 15 years ago.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got two copies of the Avalon Hill first edition available.
Copy 1 and which the price listing reflects is for a very good to like new condition version of the game.  The counters are unpunched.  The cards are unplayed and like new, except two cards in the smaller deck have slight stain from a dried up rubber band that encircled the cards for too long a time.  The box has nice color, although there is some shelf and edgewear.
Shipping for this copy is $9 to Eastern and Central US and $11 to Mountain and Pacific.
Copy 2 is available for $24.  This is also an Avalon Hill first edition.  Box has some shelf and edgewear.  The game board is in very good condition and the cards are all present, in very good condition and very lightly played.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve inventoried all the counters and there are 125 of 126 present.  The 1 missing counter is a portcullis counter which is a control marker for a player.  The game accommodates up to seven players so the only reason this missing counter would matter is if you have seven players and even then, it can easily be proxied.
All other game materials are present.
Shipping is $9 to Eastern and Central regions of the US and $11 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other locations, please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>1976 Avalon Hill First Edition. Missing a single token - all other game materials present. Has some wear from play - a tiny bit of separation on one of the board folds, and the box has some wear. Some of the tokens have writing (in pencil) on the back to help organize. The manual is complete, but has experienced some wear. A very good players copy.</notes>

    <notes>Rated good because the box has a split corner.  Components look to be perfect, though rules are a little stained.  May be missing one common counter (of 84), though there is one extra herald counter (of 23), so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really know.  All cards are there, and in perfect condition.  Two piece mapboard looks new.  Other games for sale too, and will combine shipping. </notes>

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).
A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really do Paypal any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.

    <notes>Looks to have been played once. Counters were punched but re-inserted into counter tree. Only the ships are loose. Verified complete. Cards show no wear. Box has no damage but top of lid has above average shelf wear.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $19 to Canada. $26 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.
