The sense of danger is palpable as you discover new locations and the monsters that inhabit these dark places. The core combat mechanism and enemy behavior system forces deep strategic play and clever management of stamina to survive._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dark Souls includes numerous boss and mini-boss encounters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; including one against the Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and utilizes an innovative behavior mechanism so that no two encounters are ever the same, thus giving the game near infinite replayability._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hey guys,
due to the increased shipping by Steamforged Games I am offering my pledge for sale.
Here is how it works:
The backerkit is open till 07.12.2016. If you buy the pledge from me I will send you the link to the backerkit I received. It contains the basic 80GBP pledge ... from there you need to pay shipping (depending on your location in the world) and can buy addons and decide for the language. 
This offer contains:
SOULS PLEDGE: Dark Souls™ - The Board Game + All Applicable Stretch Goals.
The game is available in:
English
French
Spanish
German
Italian
The game is supposed to ship in March 2017 and the addons in October 2017.
Price is 80 GBP * 1,37 (Conversion rate back when I pledged) + BGG Commission + Paypal fees = 120€
This offer is only valid until the pledgemanager closes, which is currently the beginning of december 2016, but might get extended (Steamforged Games is still undecided on this).
For more questions, either have a look at the Kickstarter directly (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/steamforged/dark-soulstm-the-board-game/description)
or message me.
I am doing this not to make a profit but due the increased shipping rate.</notes>

    <notes>For Sale:  The Wave 2 shipping contents of my Dark Souls the Board Game Kickstarter pledge*. It will be redirected via the backerkit to your shipping address** upon payment, with all future kickstarter updates forwarded to your email address.
*(This does not include the base game, which has already shipped. If interested, that can be arranged in a separate transaction)*
**(Only available for persons in the continental US)**
For kickstarter backers, these are all on schedule to ship this October!
At retail, these will be split up and sent out month by month, so if you weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t able to back, some of these won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be available to you until next year.
Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s locked into my pledge, and included in the sale on this page:
Mega Boss Expansions - The Four Kings
Qty: 1 x £28.00
Mega Boss Expansions - Vordt of the Boreal Valley
Qty: 1 x £28.00
Double Sided Gaming Tiles

Darkroot Basin Expansion
Qty: 1 x £35.00
Mega Boss Expansions - Asylum Demon

+ All the Stretch Goals (Which includes the following pictured content + the Solaire Mini:  http://i.imgur.com/RemcfNH.jpg )
This, plus the flat rate £24 shipping, amounts to £242, which is about 310 US Dollars ($310 is the total price for this sale. There is no additional shipping cost as implied by default on the Geek Market Item Description Box. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s already included in the pledge.)
Having just had a new baby, I need diapers more than Dark Souls_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mountain of content.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to purchase my pledge, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m accepting payment via paypal.
When you pay, include YOUR NAME and continental US SHIPPING ADDRESS.
Within 12 hours of payment and receiving of your address, the backerkit will be set to your information.
I will send confirmation information, and forward additional kickstarter related emails to your email address, should you like to supply it, though private messages via BGG would be another option.
This is my first transaction on BGG, but I hope to use the market to add some buyer/seller safety.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to examine my numerous buyer/seller feedbacks in other forums, I also go by Polioliolio on neogaf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gaming community forum for buying/selling.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also done buying/selling on Nintendoage.com where you can also look up my username, Polioliolio.  My ebay feedback is under the name squall987. All are 100% positive feedback.
*As with all kickstarters, I ask you to visit the official campaign page for Dark Souls the Board Game, read the details, and understand the possibility of delay or other setbacks related to kickstarter backed projects in general.  However, in the latest emails, everything is on schedule for the US territory regarding Wave 2 shipment!*
Thanks for your interest!</notes>

Dark Souls the Board Game (English Edition)
Like New: Opened, Never Played!
Details:  I opened this game in anticipation of playing when all the expansions arrived, but decided to sell my pledge for the upcoming expansions (of which I went in over my head), so I no longer need this base game.
 I organized each enemy/boss cards into their own baggies, sleeved the Large cards, 
didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even open the plastic seal on the smaller items cards, and organized all the tokens into baggies.
The tiles and player boards are punched and ready to go.  The minis are still encased in the plastic encasement they arrived in.
This game is virtually brand new, and again, never played.
Accepting Paypal, and will ship anywhere within the continental US, with tracking.
$80 dollars + $15 shipping =  $95 Dollaroos and you can be playing within the week!</notes>

Dark Souls standard pledge from the Kickstarter. I only have the core game as of now but when you purchase this we will change the shipping address to whatever you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like (and they currently state you will not be charged for the shipping of stretch goal material). I opened the box and went through everything (punched stuff) but haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played the game. 
Note: there was a small dent in the bottom left hand corner of the lower part of the box that was noted when I opened the shipping package.
I would be okay with venmo as a payment option, and would prefer it over PayPal, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll accept PayPal.</notes>

I have two add-ons to my pledge.
Darkroot Basin Expansion - I wanted a greater variety of minions
Mega Boss Expansions - The Four Kings - I got this one because they said it would not be available at retail.
The base box is pretty large, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing like $20 to ship.  Ships from 97123
The sooner the better so we can get the address changed.
Willing to consider offers.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter pledge edition, meaning it includes:
Player Character expansion
Core Game expansion
Iron Keep expansion
Armor Set expansion
Invaders expansion
Summoned expansion
Solaire of Astora
It ALSO includes:
Mega Boss Expansion - Asylum Demon
The base game has been sleeved and played twice.
Regarding shipping - the whole game has not shipped yet. Only the core game has shipped. The expansions are shipping in July-August. 
Shipping for the base game is $18. IF and only if you purchase this before 6/30, I can update the Backerkit so that the expansions are delivered directly to your door - this way you can avoid paying extra shipping. Otherwise, I will either make two separate shipments (at $18 a piece) or I will hold the main game until I get the stretch goals and I will ship it all together (for around $30) - your choice.
Feel free to message me with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter version, opened and punched but never played, miniatures untouched.
If the stretch goals are ever released then I will be selling these also at significant discount from the original Kickstarter price.
Note this is a large box and quite heavy so shipping costs will reflect this - likely £10 - £15 depending on destination country.
PayPal or BACS (preferred).</notes>
