   <description>1830 is one of the most famous 18xx games. One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>UNPUNCHED Game would be in Like New condition, except for two things. 1) There has been tape applied to the box to keep it shut.
2) There has been some box damage. One corner is split, and the box sustained some water damage. However, none of the this got into the components. It appears someone spilled water on it while it was in the store, as it hadn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been wet for very long.
This is a limited time offer, as it will be going to eBay very soon. Pictures available upon request. Any questions you have, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.</notes>

    <notes>I would describe this game as, overall, in fair condition: the rulebook has numerous thumb-creases and folds; many of the player-aid cards have stains; the money is still good; overall the board is pretty good but has a few stains, mostly in the lower right corner, one in the deep south, a couple near the edge on the left. It appears that all of the counters and railroad hexagons are there (although I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be sure about the hexagons) and are all in good condition. The playing cards mostly look good, apart from one or two with slight marks. The box is solid, but worn with some stains, surface tears, and a couple of folds.</notes>

    <notes>OOP.  One of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Big 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Played once.  Box has some wear and the remnants of a sticker on the cover.  Contents are fine.
Will also throw in a copy of the variant entitled, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Take a Ride on the Reading_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; published by Avalon Hill.
 
Payment Notes:
Non-US buyers will have to pay via Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) (as it is the only way that I can assure that there will not be any funny business) unless you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks. If you have the positive trade references, I would be able to accept a Paypal payment. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
US buyers: USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
If the receiver elects not to pay extra for insurance (totally up to you) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers: Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.

    <notes>This game is in the original factory wrap. It has been kept in a darkened room so the box graphics are sharp and not dulled by the passage of time. The game is an absolute time capsule. It is perfect in every way and looks like it has just been published.
Also I have the General issue volume 26 number six which goes with the game, for sale as well, if interested. I can arrange for a sale of this to the buyer of the game for a price to be determined later.
Basically buy the game and I will also sell you the General magazine (which is also in pristine condition and contains additional tiles for the play of the game).
I give you my word that this is totally unique in condition and that you will be satisfied.
Thanks;

    <notes>Game is unplayed.  All components are present, including the blank tiles and shares which came with the game. (Yes, I counted the money, tiles, shares, trains, and counters to make sure.)  I have been the only owner of this copy.
The rulebook is in excellent condition. The shares, trains, and company cards have been separated, and the counters punched.  There is a slight warp to some of the private company, train, and player order cards.  Because those cards were perforated, their edges do look rough.  The tiles were likewise separated.  The board is in good condition -- Because of age, it is a bit stiff to open, and there is light wear on one panel where it rested in the box. The box is in acceptable to good condition.  The cover looks quite clean, but there is a slight outward bow to the box top (from mild humidity, I suspect).  There is also slight box wear on the bottom of the box and on the left side of the front of the box, and substantial box wear on one panel of the box top (where it rested bookshelf-style, for a while).
Note that I do reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount. (I charge an estimate of the actual shipping cost.)</notes>

    <notes>This is a never used board game. I bought this in the mid 90_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s during a phase when I was buying lots of games. Never got around to playing this one. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in new condition and the outside of the box is perfect. You will have no complaints. All I did was remove the shrink wrap to look at the game then packed it away and never played it.

    <notes>Have so many 18XX games and my group does not play this one.  So letting it go.
In good condition with shipping going to be the Medium Flat Rate shipper from USPS.
If want pictures I can get some to you.
I went into the box today and found a split corner and the box itself has some shelf wear.  The game pieces themselves are in like new condition.
Only reason I am letting it go is because I have so many 18XX games that I am not playing. I DO play 1850, 1854, 1870, 1835, 1861 a lot more so not selling those. 
If no one purchases it you will see it at GENCON in the auction their.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Absolute classic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1830: The Game of Railroads and Robber Barons_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from Avalon Hill (1986).
The game was played about 5 times since I purchased it. All parts are accounted for (including English rulebook). The box shows wear at the corners, and the game board shows wear at 2 spots (where the folding board pieces come together). Otherwise the game is in good condition.
The pictures below show the actual item.
Delivery will be via Royal Mail, to the UK mainland at 8 pounds, to the rest of Europe at 20 pounds.
If you know a cheaper way of shipping please let me know, and I would be happy to try to arrange cheaper delivery.
If you have any questions feel free to write me!

Punched, complete. Looks like it was played a couple of times, perhaps. (I bought it pre-owned, but never got around to playing it.)
Box: shelf wear on box top and bottom; all corners are solid
Map: Excellent; still crinkles a little
Tiles/certs: Excellent
Money: Looks like it may have been used (?); previous owner wrapped an elastic band around the center, which has caused some stress; replaced with baggie when I got it
Shipping will be really cheap as I get to ship through my employer, at their (discount) rates.

    <notes>Includes Expansion BONUS! See below.
UNPUNCHED! And in Very Good Condition.  The only thing stopping this from being like new is the shelf-wear on the corners (box is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) of the box front and what appears to be a small piece of tape on one corner (hard to detect).
Inside the contents are unpunched and pristine, although there are some small blemishes on the board and manual. They look like they could simply be wiped off with a cloth.  I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just dust from sitting for so long.  The game has clearly never been used.
BONUS!  I also have a like new copy of the General that I will include with your purchase this is the edition which features the Reading Railroad Expansion along with all the cards and tiles you need to play.    This is the authentic edition of the General, not a photocopy.
This is a steal at this price.</notes>

The only blemish - if that is the correct word - is that it is my custom to highlight the essential rules in the rule book (it saves reading every single word each time)   Apart from that, evem the rule book is like new.

Instead, it will ride the rails on swift, powerful _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Iron Horses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 1830™ is an acclaimed railroad investment and building game covering the years 1830 to present. You and your fellow players become the stockholders of America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s first railroad corporations. Since the largest shareholder becomes president, you compete for control of the strongest firms.
As president, generate revenue by building track and buying and operating trains-regardless of shareholders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; needs. Meanwhile, you pay heed to the volatile stock market. You strive to invest in flourishing companies in order to earn healthy dividends. You try to buy stock in corporations that are rising in value, collect strong, and sell before the stock values drop.
 
1830 contains rules and components for Francis Tresham_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and a host of exciting new variants from some of the world_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s best railroad game developers. The 2-sided map lets you develop the Eastern U.S. using different art. So, get ready to be a railroad baron. Start investing and building. Become America_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s first great rail tycoon!</notes>

    <notes>This is a very nice copy of the classic Avalon Hill version of 1830.  It is opened and punched but has no substantial wear or marks from play.  It is a great copy of this game.
Shipping will be by USPS Priority for $10 (unless I can do it cheaper in a USPS Priority Regional rate box, in which case I will charge less). I can also do free local pickup in the Sacramento/Davis area.
I will get this packed and shipped within one business day of payment.</notes>

Read definition for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; conditions. 
There is light scuffing on box and one corner has some breakage.
Game itself in very good condition, but missing one black RR marker and one yellow RR marker and one $100 bill. These are minor pieces.
Acceptable proxy has been made for the black and yellow markers with printed photo of the pieces attached to cardboard. 
You can play the game without the $100 bill. Most people use poker chips anyway.</notes>

    <notes>This copy is fully sorted, separating the main tiles/tokens from the variant tiles. The copy also includes the errata tiles fixing many typos from the initial second edition printing.
All components are in great shape (played base game only once). There is slight dishing to the box cover (which is this only reason this is listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).
Note -- The matching _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1830: Chattanooga Promotional Card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is also available for sale. Please contact for details.</notes>

    <notes>Hi guys,
This game is in excellent condition and has never been played. I have attached a picture of the components.
I would prefer an Australian buyer due to the shipping cost. But if you are happy to pay the shipping to elsewhere that will be fine.
If you are within Australia I would suggest bank transfer rather than PayPal as that is easier and does not charge extra fees.
Thank you for your consideration.</notes>
