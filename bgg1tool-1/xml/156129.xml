   <description>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Roles_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Forensic Scientist x1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Key Evidence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Means of Murder._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Murderer x1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Key Evidence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Means of Murder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; respectively._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Key Evidence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Means of Murder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Investigators x8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Key Evidence_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;Means of Murder,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Accomplice x1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Witness x1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Bought this game online a few months ago and have gotten it to the table a few times.  I was very excited and my friends enjoyed it, but I think my friends were too burnt out on games like One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Resistance.   Therefore, this game didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make the cut.  Game was only brought out a couple times, played around 5x each time it was opened up.  Game is essentially brand new.

    <notes>Selling the Kickstarter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Top of the Class_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge edition from the recent Undercover Allies campaign:
- Deception: Murder in Hong Kong base game (w/ original KS pack)
- Deception: Undercover Allies expansion plus all unlocked stretch goals
- all three exclusive theme packs
- the exclusive badge and marker upgrade kit add-ons
I have opened the boxes to ensure everything is present but otherwise in new and unplayed condition.
Postage will be £8.00 in the U.K.
For European postage I have to use DPD (https://www.dpdlocal-online.co.uk) as they are the only service that is remotely cost effective from Northern Ireland. Additionally they don’t have drop off points (despite what their website says) so I have to arrange for them to collect from me.
Please get a quote to your location for a 2.5kg parcel with dimensions of 36x26x16cm and decide for yourself whether you are happy with the postage costs before contacting me.</notes>
