A Desperate Struggle for Victory in the Most Brutal Conflict of WWII
German tanks thunder into the snow-covered Ardennes forest, opposed only by a few unsuspecting divisions of exhausted American troops. As Axis forces plunge into the countryside, Allied troops must struggle to hold the front line in order to repel the all-out offensive. Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge challenges you to control territory and contend with supply shortages, while directing infantry, artillery, tanks, and aircraft in one of the most decisive conflicts of World War II.
Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge features detailed game components including a new truck piece, a hex-based game board with original artwork. Other elements of this new Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies variant include circumstances that played key factors in the historical battle, such as supply shortages and late-battle air support, mechanics for overland vs. road movement, and randomized war casualties.
Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies depicts Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhein), the German code name for this counteroffensive that took place toward the end of World War II. The objective: To capture the port city of Antwerp. It was expected the capture of Antwerp would cause great disruption in the Allied supply lines, and threaten to fracture the great Anglo-American alliance.
One player controls Germany, whose massive military build-up has gone undetected by the Allies, and are poised to unleash hell upon enemy forces. The second player controls the United Kingdom and the United States -- they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.
Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge, designed for two players, can be played in three to four hours. The game is the fourth Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies D-Day, Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Europe and Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific versions.
Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge contains:
1 Game Board 
1 Rulebook 
12 Twelve-Sided Dice 
1 Turn Marker 
1 Victory-Point Marker

    <notes>Very nice shape, no issues, set up but never played. Should be a 3 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.

As Axis forces plunge into the countryside, Allied troops must struggle to hold the front line in order to repel the all-out offensive. Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies: Battle of the Bulge challenges you to control territory and contend with supply shortages, while directing infantry, artillery, tanks, and aircraft in one of the most decisive conflicts of World War II.
Scheduled for release in November, 2006, Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Battle of the Bulge will feature detailed game components including a new truck piece, a hex-based game board with new original artwork, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the Battle of the Bulge game box. Other elements of this new Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies variant include crucial elements that were key factors in the historical battle, such as supply shortages and late-battle air support, mechanics for overland vs. road movement and randomized casualties of war
Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies depicts Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhein), the German code name for this counteroffensive that took place toward the end of World War II. The objective: to capture the port city of Antwerp. It was expected that the capture of Antwerp would cause a great disruption in the flow of Allied supplies, and also have the effect of breaking apart the great Anglo-American alliance.
One player controls Germany, whose massive build up of forces have gone undetected by the Allies and are poised to unleash all their fury on the Allies. The other player controls the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States and they must stem the tide of German armor and hold their positions until reinforcements arrive.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game has been played once (actually half a game!).  Components are still in very good condition.
 
All game components are present (plastic playing pieces, markers, tokens, charts, combat strips, and dice).  I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t count all of the plastic chips, but I think they are all there.  The board is in excellent condition.
The storage tray is in place.  All major component groups are bagged.
The rules were bent a bit when the package arrived (about an inch away from the fold).
During initial shipment, the game box was damaged.  Along the upper left corner (looking at the box top), the box has been indented a bit (both box top and bottom).  Damage is minor, box is still sound.  The box top is starting to show signs of flaring along the long sides.  In spite of that, the box is still in very good condition.
 
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>Item is in very good shape with all pieces present.  I downgraded it to acceptable because the rules are not present.  The rules can be downloaded from the Wizards of the Coast website (http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/botbrules.pdf).  The game is un-punched, except for the storage tray punch out.
Please note, shipping will be a bit extra because the box is rather large.

    <notes>Perfect condition of all components, no wear.
Postage in EUR ca 10,-, Overseas: 25,-
Note: US initial set up in this game is not according to the historic strength (escpecially in the North) and rules need to be updated with some house rules about defensive fire (especially for artillery) before the attacker
rolls his dies..........
There are plenty of units and fiches in this game to adjust the game with minor changes.</notes>

    <notes>My late husband loved to collect his board games.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play them as much as he would of liked, but if they were played, they were handled with kid gloves.  No food or drinking around his games!</notes>

[b]Shipping Options:[/b]
I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)
UPS Ground
FedEx Home 
FedEx Ground (commercial addresses only)</notes>
