   <description>The game board represents a fantasy land.  Players chose a character from a list of semi-standard fantasy types: Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, etc.  The objective of the game is to travel through the land encountering event cards and gathering strength along the way.  Hopefully players will eventually become powerful enough to travel to the center of the board, endure the trials there and take the Crown of Command for the victory.  There were also several expansions released for this game, which add new character choices and new places to travel._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Talisman series of games and expansions published by Games Workshop Ltd.._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first edition differs from the second only in the box cover art and the cards, which were printed in black and white (same artwork as the second edition, though).

    <notes>Second Edition
Includes: base game, Talisman Expansion AND Talisman Dungeon.
All of the above are complete, as verified against the  FAQ/checklist (http://www.faqs.org/faqs/games/talisman/edition2/), and the components are all in excellent condition.  The only thing missing is the die that came with the original; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be happy to throw some miscellaneous dice in.
Note, though, that I only have the box for the original game.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even remember if the expansions came in a box or not, but they are long gone if they did.</notes>

    <notes>I have a Talisman 3rd edition in it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s original box.  I kept all the cards in seperate polybags as well as the original dice and figures.  In addition are the following expansions:
Dungeon of Doom (complete)
City of Adventure (complete)
Dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Tower (including cardboard tower but no dragon)
These expansions came without box so are inside of main Talisman box (they fit nicely).  As noted above the only thing missing from all components is the dragon from the tower expansion.  It was lost before I acquired the expansion but serves no purpose except to be on top of the tower as an ornament.  The boards and figures are not damaged in any way although the Wood Elf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cape is painted green (all others are unpainted).  Every card is in great shape with no rips.  Overall the game and expansions are in very good shape.

    <notes>Talisman 2nd edition large collection:
Includes the main 2nd edition box set and 5 expansion sets.
Mostly in excellent, even close to like new condition; very impressive condition for an older game. I had the main set and most of the expansions new and unpunched until last year, when I made the inventory/contents lists for the games here on BGG before using the game the one and only time. Counters are neatly sorted into a counter tray (included). 
Includes boxes, rules, and everything from all the following:
1) Talisman 2nd edition base set
2) Talisman the Adventure
3) Talisman Expansion
4) Talisman the Dungeon (items 1-4 all neatly combined into the main box, but as mentioned, all boxes and such still included).
5) Talisman the City (complete, not yet combined into the other sets)
6) Talisman Timescape (complete, not yet combined into the other sets)
The boxes are fairly heavy, shipping will be somewhat expensive (about $18 within the US, plus $5 for insurance).</notes>

    <notes>This is the Second Edition, with the Adventure Expansion.  It is all in one box, no separate box for the Adventure.  Everything is there except for 3 Character Sheets.    Box is a bit scuffed, and parts have play wear.  Feel free to ask me any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent copy of the 2nd edition base game.  Complete and very little play to it.  4 piece board has some markings on the back of the boards and there are a few markings on two of the game board spaces and if you tilt the board in the light there is a light ring in one of the corner spaces but again, with the board laying flat, not really noticeable and overall, board is quite clean. Auction seller, sheriff and the frog rated this set an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Box shows some rubbing wear (primarily on back), top has some minor creasing but is in otherwise excellent condition.  Shipping will be charged based on zip code destination.</notes>

    <notes>Talisman 2nd edition. The game is complete. All the game cards are present. The game board (I have the puzzle version) still looks good. One corner of the box is torn but taped up. 
There were two player cards (not the character cards but the player cards) and 19 counters missing, but I have replaced them with colour facimilies. I have also mounted the replacement counters and player cards on proper cardboard.</notes>

    <notes>This is my original copy of this wonderful game.  It has been well loved and played a zillion times.  All pieces have been counted and present.  100% complete.  Unfortunately, the box has been battered from years of use.  I will repair the corners upon request. The pictures should hopefully tell everything.  
Cards are generally in good shape.  No tears on any.  The wand adventure card and the preservation card has a small bit of staining near the text (not on the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;adventure back_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The character cards and stand ups are in really good shape.  No creasing should be present on any cards.
If you have any questions regarding this game please ask.  I will go into as much detail as possible before completing the sale.
I accept Paypal (mbecker@accesscomm.ca), International money order (buyers from the U.S. I can only accept the pink slips not the domestic green slips) or cash.
Shipping is always at cost from mid-western Canada.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>TALISMAN 2nd ed. + The Adventure by Games Workshop 1983
This auction is for a boxed 2nd edition Talisman game that also comes with the Talisman Adventure expansion set.  The Talisman game and Adventure expansion are punched, but in excellent condition and have probably been played only once or twice.  The Talisman box is in excellent condition with no splits or tears and with some minor shelf wear.  There appears to be more enclosed in the main game than what is listed in the combined contents of the Talisman and Adventure expansion combined, so here’s the content of the box:
Talisman game board
203 Adventure cards (there should only be 171 between the game and Adventure expansion)
47 Spell cards
35 Purchase cards
5 good/evil cards (there should only be 4)
5 Toad cards (there should only be 4)
5 Talisman cards (there should only be 4)
7 Full Color Character Mats (there should only be 6)
35 Character Cards
35 Character standup cards
6 Plastic Character stands 
6 Final Showdown cards  
40 gold tokens
100 Marker tokens
1 set of Talisman Rules
1 set of the Adventure expansion Rules
1 six-sided die
It is complete by my count and then some.  The components are in excellent condition with no tears or creases on any of the cards!  The board is in near mint condition.
Shipping flat rate $9 to lower 48.  Actual cost to Europe or Canada TBD later.  Money orders preferred but checks accepted from BGG supporters.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the first edition of the game. Game is complete except for some counters. The game is missing one each of the strength and craft counters and six of the life counters. These missing counters are not critical for playing the game. Cards are all there (counted and verified against game inventory). Game is in excellent condition: all components have hardly any wear. Board has slight scuffing from storage, but no split corners.</notes>

    <notes>1st edition Talisman from Games Workshop.  Very good condition.  Game box has nice coloring and integrity is very good.  I have reviewed game materials and they are in very good condition, although I have not thoroughly inventoried (see note below).
I also have Talisman: The Adventure expansion and Talisman Expansion set that will bundle the base game and the two expansions and sell for $80.
Note:  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game on behalf of a friend whose father recently passed and who had a remarkable collection of games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting in coming weeks.  There are too many games in this collection for me to meticulously inventory beyond just a basic review but I have no reason to expect any problems with these games as I personally know they have been very well cared for the last 20+ years (generally all the games in this collection are lightly played).  Other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting from this collection include:  Outpost, Magic Realm, Divine Right, Gunslinger, Merchant of Venus, The Lonely Mountain, Sword and Sorcery, Talisman, and nearly 30 others so please ask if there is something else you are looking for from this era as I might actually have it.
Shipping is $8 to Central and Eastern US and $10 to Pacific and Mountain regions.  All other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>RESERVED for Frank...
The box is solid, but the box bottom was repaired artfully with white glue to repair a side tear and to reinforce that same corner. Otherwise, no broken corners, and just the usual corner whitening, dings and slight dishing is there.
The components show minor signs of handling. But most everything is there, bagged neatly and in better than playable condition. It is missing one blue 1 chit, and three characters have been reinforced with clear tape at their bottom edge.
If you have more specific questions about condition, please send me a geekmail. I will send photos if requested.</notes>

    <notes>Found this in a Charity Shop a few years ago, it has been in a cupboard ever since, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never got around to playing it (my current game-playing friends prefer Euro-style games), and I now need to have a clear-out.
It looks as if it has hardly ever been played (the game components are complete and all in a very good condition). However, there is some very minor scuffing to the lid.

    <notes>Includes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Timescape_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; expansion (unboxed but complete)
I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t played my copy of this for ages and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure there are homes where it would be more appreciated. I must have had this for over 20 years. Given this you might expect the box to be somewhat worn and it is! One corner of the bottom half of the box is split but still standing true. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s creases coming from the corners of the top of the box where it has been stacked. Happy to supply photos of this if you want.
Have counted everything out and there are a few counters missing as follows: 1 bag of gold, 1 craft counter, 5 strength counters, 3 life counters. Everything else is present and in fairly good nick. There are also only 4 character stands (rather than 6). On the other hand both cards for the gladiator from the expansion are included (think one of my friends gave me this character for some reason lost in the mists of time).</notes>
