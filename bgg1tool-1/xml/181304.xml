   <description>In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMMYST01)
A horrible crime has been committed on the grounds of Warwick Manor and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to the psychic investigators to get to the bottom of it. In Mysterium, one player takes on the role of the ghost and over the course of a week, tries to lead the investigators to their culprit. Each night the team will be met with visions, but what is the ghost trying to tell you? Can the psychics determine the weapon, location and killer or will a violent criminal pull off the perfect murder?</notes>

A horrible crime has been committed on the grounds of Warwick Manor and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s up to the psychic investigators to get to the bottom of it. In Mysterium, one player takes on the role of the ghost and over the course of a week, tries to lead the investigators to their culprit. Each night the team will be met with visions, but what is the ghost trying to tell you? Can the psychics determine the weapon, location and killer or will a violent criminal pull off the perfect murder?</notes>

Opened the game to start teaching it and then ended up deciding to play something else. That was a year ago and my copy still hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t made it to the table. Great game but I think it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to move on to a home where it will actually see play time.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played three times. It is in like-new condition.
Due to some unfortunate life events, I am forced to sell my board game collection. For several years I was paid to demo games and afterward, had the option of purchasing the game I demo’d. Because of this, most of my games are either new or have been played once.
I have a large number of games for sale, some quite small, so please check my inventory to see if you’d like to purchase multiple items. I will work with you a bit on price if you do, and of course, it will save on shipping.
I am an eBay top-rates seller with over 4200 positive feedback. I ship promptly and pack the items well. You will not receive beat-up games with pieces thrown all over inside the box.
After purchase, buyer will be responsible for exact shipping charges. I accept PayPal only unless prearranged ahead of time.</notes>

    <notes>Used once.  Family doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like it because I introduced it to them and wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ready to teach it.   So our first play through was not enjoyable.
My loss is your gain. 
Feel free to ask me any questions.

    <notes>I have removed the shrink from the outer box but otherwise the components are unopened and unpunched.
Included is the Hidden Signs expansion which is still sealed.
Postage costs will vary depending on your location. In the U.K. I normally use MyHermes as they can collect from my location - not all of the couriers do.
The cost of shipping within the U.K. is normally between £5-£10 depending on the weight of the game - most of the regular sized (square box) games I am selling tend to be in the 2-5kg category.
I always ship with tracking information and enough insurance to cover the cost of the game.
Please contact me for a postage quote before purchasing the game.</notes>
