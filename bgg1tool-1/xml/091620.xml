    <notes>In brand new condition, played just once. I only charge the exact postage cost given by Royal Mail_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s site for the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s preferred service and the game weighs just over 2kg boxed up. If the PO weigh it lower I always refund any difference :)</notes>

A World of Beautiful Colors comes alive as players choose commission cards picturing 34 of the finest European art works of the past six centuries. Players score their commissions by mixing primary colors through clever tile placement, and recreating the palette of colors used by the masters who created these works. Explore the paintings, palettes and pasts of the artists in this unique and challenging game for the whole family.
While placing hexagonal pieces to gain palette (color) cards, players become familiar with the different color combinations that produce the many hues of an artist’s palette... all listed on the Player Reference Card. Players also learn to recognize many great artists and their works as they complete commissions.

Check out my other listings! Buyer to pay shipping, but I will combine shipping to save you money. I prefer to use Regional or Flat Rate USPS boxes, but will ship other method if you like. I also prefer to ship to the USA only as it is usually too expensive to ship overseas and is just a waste of time for everyone to pursue it. I will ship as soon as the payment clears.</notes>
