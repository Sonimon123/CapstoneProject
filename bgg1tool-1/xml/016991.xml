   <description>Khet (a.k.a. Deflexion) is a chess-like board game that has two built in lasers and movable Egyptian-themed game pieces that have embedded mirrors that can be positioned to bounce the laser light around the board and hit opponent pieces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To play, players alternate moving their pieces around the board. Some pieces have mirrors and some do not. Bounding the board is a raised frame into which are built two low-power lasers, one for each player. The game pieces include a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pharaoh_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, obelisks, and pyramids with mirrors. After each move, a player must press the button on his/her laser. The beam bounces from mirror to mirror around the playing field. The challenge is to protect one's own pharaoh while maneuvering to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;light up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; the opposing player's pharaoh._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Deflexion edition of the game, and as such it does not come with the extra 2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Obelisk_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pieces found in Khet (if you must have them, I believe the publisher produced extras for Deflexion owners). The box is lime green, and the pieces are silver and gold.
The box is slightly dented in one area. All pieces present, game is complete and very lightly played.</notes>

    <notes>Complete, works great, batteries included, the components are in very good condition. Box is still functional, but has seen better days; probably would benefit from some tape and/or glue.  I recently bought this game on eBay, but my wife and I are apparently more into card and word games (and of course Carcassonne).  So Khet is now taking up too much closet space in our apartment. Shipping and handling is $10.00 for USPS parcel post to anywhere in the U.S.($12.00 for UPS ground) I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGG but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been selling on eBay for years with a perfect feedback rating!

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 5 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original Deflexion edition of Khet. It has, in my opinion, the best _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Table showpiece_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; value, being a bit more solid and impressive looking than later editions. The is some slight box wear, but the contents are in perfect condition including all pieces and original packaging elements. 
I have several games for sale so please check my geekmarket page. Order multiple games and save on shipping and handling.
