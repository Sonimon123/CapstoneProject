   <description>The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game I bought actually long time ago.
I played it around maybe 20 times, the outside box show lots of wear and tear but the content inside are in good condition.
The first time you play this game is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;learning period_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cuz you gotta read every single card to find out that each card do. But the 2nd time around you should able to fly through a game or 2 with a breeze.
You know, my experience with games has grow over times. I am getting to know what kind of game I am into and what kinda game I am not. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s like you pick a broad direction at first and then keep refining your like and niches until you reach the kind of game you truly like to play.
Guillotine is a part of this process and unfortunately it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t align with my current interest anymore so I had to let it go. Yes, I am letting you have it...for a fee of course. 
U.S. Shipping is $3.99 by USPS, local pickup is available as well so you save the shipping fee.
I live in Queens zip 11364. I take Paypal, Money Order and Checks.
Let me know if you got any questions.
Thanks for visiting.

Yes we can combine orders at significant shipping discounts.
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Combined shipping works as follows for domestic (48 lower states) orders:
Highest price shipping item: Full shipping cost
2nd-4th highest priced items: 50% off shipping cost for each of these items.
5th-10th highest priced shipping items: 60% off shipping costs for each of these items.
11th+ highest priced shipping items: 75% off shipping for all the rest of the items.
As an example say you purchased 15 games, 3 of them with $10 shipping, 5 of them with $8 shipping and 7 of them with $4 shipping. The total shipping for the 15 items would be:
Full shipping on the first item: $10.00
50% off shipping on items 2-4: $14.00 (50% off $10, $10 and $8, the next highest shipping cost items)
60% off shipping on items 5-10: $14.40 (60% off of 3 items at $8 shipping and 3 more items at $4 shipping = $36)
75% off shipping on items 11-15: $4.00 (75% off 4 items at $4)
Total shipping on these 15 items then would be $10+$14+$14.40 + $4 = $42.40 shipping. This is just an example and your results will vary depending on what you buy of course!</notes>

The item comes from a private collection (non-smoking). If you want pictures of the box or have any question in advance, just send me a geekmail or email to baxel@gmx.at , I will usually respond within 48 hours.
--++ Shipping ++--
Shipping costs depend on the size and weight of the package and the destination. I use the austrian federal postal service (usually the cheapest option).

Up to 2kg with insurance: € 15,-
Up to 5kg with insurance: € 18,-
Shipping costs to destinations outside of the EU vary.

    <notes>PS Games - Guillotine
Language: Dutch
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 12+
Duration: about 45 min
Weight: 0.230 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game. As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles. Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone. However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;harvesting,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; which is what makes the game interesting. After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.

    <notes>Wizards of the Coast (WOC 218880000)
 
This irreverent and humorous card game takes place during the French Revolution. Players represent rival guillotine operators vying for the best collection of noble heads over three rounds. You want top bragging rights, so you’d better collect the most prestigious noggins. Will you be skillful enough to bribe the guards and collect Marie Antoinette? Or will you lose points for beheading the Hero of the People. </notes>

    <notes>Never played. Box says 2011 or 2013 edition though.
I will be in the US at the end of October and November (2018), so could ship from within the US or local pickup in Orlando/WDW area. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also be at Spiel on Thursday and possibly Friday (2018).
I ship worldwide, but PLEASE contact me before purchasing if you want to know the shipping costs.
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use Paypal, after being scammed a couple of times. Will only accept bank transfer or cash with local pick-up.
Afhalen is mogelijk in Dordrecht/Rotterdam op afspraak.
If you have any other questions, please contact me.</notes>
