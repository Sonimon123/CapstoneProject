    <notes>Comments:
See my other offers for other titles in this series.
Condition Notes:
This offer is for a copy that has been played a few times, but is in excellent shape.
I also have a copy that is still in shrinkwrap for $55.99.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).
A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really do Paypal any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.

    <notes>Flying Buffalo (FBI6003)
A comical card game of nuclear confrontation involving nervous world powers and jittery diplomats. Everyone jockeys for domination (in self defense, of course), using propaganda, espionage, and meanwhile building space platforms (for peaceful purposes, of course). Diplomacy inevitably fails and the missiles start flying! The first expansion set for Nuclear War, this can also be played on its own. </notes>

    <notes>Flying Buffalo (FBI6003)
A comical card game of nuclear confrontation involving nervous world powers and jittery diplomats. Everyone jockeys for domination (in self defense, of course), using propaganda, espionage, and meanwhile building space platforms (for peaceful purposes, of course). Diplomacy inevitably fails and the missiles start flying! The first expansion set for Nuclear War, this can also be played on its own.</notes>

    <notes>My late husband loved to collect his board games.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play them as much as he would of liked, but if they were played, they were handled with kid gloves.  No food or drinking around his games!</notes>
