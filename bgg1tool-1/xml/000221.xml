   <description>Shogun / Samurai Swords / Ikusa is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Would list as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; but noticed one sword stand missing. A nice addition to a stategy/wargame collection. Prefer to sell with Stratego and will pay shipping/handling if purchased together and in US.

    <notes>Samurai Swords version. This game is BRAND NEW, never played with. The pieces are still on the spires and the game pieces still sealed in their original bags! The shrinkwrap, however, has been removed. The box itself is in excellent condition, with one exception, the top is somewhat _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bowed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; a little bit as if there had been something heavy stored on top of it but the corners are perfect NO SPLITS. I will provide pictures just email me
This game is awesome looking and a perfect addition to your collection. I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time to play it.
Shipping to the U.S. only. I can combine shipping on multiple items. Shipping within USA via USPS Parcel Post or Priority Mail, your choice. 
Thanks for looking!

    <notes>Shogun - Original version by MB.
A true classic.  This game has been played but is still in pretty good shape.  The box is scuffed but has no split corners.  All pieces double counted and included.  Koku and dice in original packaging.  
If you want this item without the 5 reference screens I will deduct 10.00 off the list price.  Please note this game is listed in U.S. currency.
Shipping will be actual cost from Western Canada.  If buying overseas please contact me to get a shipping quote first.  
I accept paypal, cash, or international money order.  If buying from the U.S. these are pink not green in color.
Thanks for looking!!</notes>

    <notes>Unpunched! Decals, cards, armies, ronin, koku, castles, swords, dice, trays and sword holders all still in original plastic bags and/or still attached. Cardboard army plates unused but some semi-detached from holder.
When I buy on eBay or Boardgamegeek I prefer an open but unpunched game since I can see that all items are present. If you buy a Shrinkwrapped game and something_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re up the creek.
All here all mint. Enjoy!
This one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heavy so be prepared for a substantial shipping fee which will be calculated form my zip code of 33559 to yours. Insurance optional for domestic order but Delivery Confirmation a must. Insurance mandatory for International order.</notes>

    <notes>Samurai Swords version.  The components are bagged and in excellent condition... except the eastern territory cards are missing.  The foam bases are in great condition.  Everything inside the box has been played twice, but somehow the East cards eluded the box.  The box is in good shape, but two corners are split on the top box and there is a dent along one of the sides.
S/H in the US:  $12 (the box is very large!)</notes>

    <notes>Samurai Swords
Everything in the box box is in very good condition. Appears to have been played maybe twice. It was missing half of the territory cards (East), of which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed new cards and sleeved all of them so there is no knowing which are not original. The box has a little caving on one side and a split corner, but looks very good for its age.
Game comes from a smoke free/pet free environment.  Shipping is $11.00</notes>

Inside the board and instructions are pristine.  The Ninja appears to be missing.  The swords, stands, quick reference cards and trays are present but the styrofoam pieces see significant wear.  All of the armies are complete except for the blue army which is missing approximately half its pieces, including the experience trackers.  All pieces are bagged and sorted.</notes>

    <notes>This is a Fun Complete Game !
Ready for play. This game has been played and has been across the country and the box top shows the wear (see pics), but inside all the pieces are there and in decent shape. I have just gone through it separated, counted and can answer any questions. I have not sold here yet, but have done plenty on Ebay and Craigslist and I am a reputable seller (and buyer). See my profile NoMilkToast or send me an email with any questions.
It comes with the following:
1 Gameboard
1 Rule book
1 Deck of 72 cards (all 4 extras are there)
5 Army Cards
5 Reference Screens
5 Game trays
5 Samurai swords with stands
1 Common game tray
5 12 sided dice
10 Castles
5 Fortresses
10 Battle markers
31 Koku chips
1 Ninja
28 Ronin
ALL Armies contain the following:
3 Army markers
3 Experience Markers
3 Daimyos
9 Ashigaru Gunners
9 Samurai Bowmen
9 Samurai Swordsmen
40 + Ashigaru Spearmen (Most 42+) much more than the 36 needed)
Very few of the figures have broken off or bent weapons with the one notable exception being one red flagman has the flag broken off (I taped it back on). All others are complete and in good shape.

Used.  complete and in very good shape components wise.   original rules.  a couple of flag bearers have snapped (flags still present, but i will leave them to you to decide whether to tape or model glue them).   
Box shows what I would classify as a little sun damage, but no split corners, etc.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m offering this fantastic game in a very good and 100% complete conditon.
Every single miniature, Ronin, Koku-chip, card, dice, sword etc. has been enumerated - and more than everything is there! (=you even get more than what you need as there are a couple of spare figurines in every colour and even extra Koku!!)
Everything of the game (including the cards!) shows only minimal signs of use. This copy has only been played twice - not more!! The box of course has been lying on the shelf for 20 years and shows some wear...
(Psst - and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for a brandnew, unplayed copy with everything unpunched, then drop me a line!!)
It is the German SHOGUN edition but language does not matter in this classic wargame.
All games come from a private collection (non-smoking environment)!
Please contact me if you´re looking for more interesting German games as I can offer a lot more.
Buyer pays postage, so ask before buying to determine the weight of your desired games!

    <notes>The rulebook is in good shape but read (no stains or obvious folding, but you can tell its been read).
The box has slight dishing in the top and fraying at the corners. The graphic on one of the sides is starting to come off. There is clear packing tape affixed to 4 sides and the bottom.
The insides are actually in really good shape,
everything is present and in very good shape. (The 4 blank cards are a little bent because the swords were placed between them and the rest of the cards and wrapped in a rubber band...no staining from the rubber band).
None of the swords of the ronin are broken.
All the armies are complete (2 have an additional figure (73 instead of 72)).
There are 3 extra spearmen of each color.
A spear tip has broken off of one of the spearmen. I replaced the orange army spearman with one of the replacements (and threw the replacement guy into the replacement bag).
The rest of the army is in great shape (a couple spearmen in red and orange have a slight white mark where the spear head meets the shaft where they were bent a little, but other than that everything is in remarkable shape).
 
There are 36 red token pieces (instead of 30).
The board looks like it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played with.
Actually now that I think about it, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d question whether it has been played at all.</notes>

    <notes>Vintage original SHOGUN by MB.  Box is in very good condition, pieces inside are mint condition, very possibly have never been played.  All playing pieces are in their original bags.  Everything has been inventoried and is present.  This game was purchased in Germany, and thus has two very minor differences: 1)There is a sticker explaining the game in German on the front of the box. 2)The rules are in German, not a problem as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s very easy to get the English rules.  Shipping to the US and Germany only, but both are only $15!!
Payment by Paypal is preferred, but I will also accept personal check and USPS money orders.  Shipping will be immediately after payment has cleared.</notes>

    <notes>MY COPY HAS EXTRA BITS AND COLOR-MATCHED DICE! 
Images are present of my copy in my gallery...  
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/images/user/87284
Excellent with extra bits and added bonuses.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got an extra fortification base, an extra koku and lots of extra minis.  74 Purple Army, 76 Green, 87 Red, 74 Lt. Blue, 76 Orange  All army units are bagged in excellent condition.
The four blank territory cards are present, and unused.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also added extra d12 dice which match closely with the color of the minis themselves:  7 red; 7 green; 7 orange; 8 black; 4 light blue (no light purple yet).
The foam trays are beautiful, the swords are pristine, and the board is in in excellent shape.
The box is the only item of condition issue.  It does have packing tape wrapped around the narrow circumference of it--and I tried to remove a couple of inches on one side, but it tore some of the color off.  So I left it on.  
It has a slight sag in the middle, but has four strong corners.  Superficial corner wear and dings throughout.I purchased it used on eBay about ten years ago and have played it five times since.
Shipping will be paid for by the purchaser via FedEx Ground--and I get a 9% discount shipping that way, plus if you have a business address it will be as much as $5 cheaper.  $100 insurance, tracking, and 3-Day delivery provided...</notes>

    <notes>Box has a crease on the left hand side, and minor dishing from where a smaller game was stored on top of it.  Other than that there is minimal shelf wear.  Game contents are in excellent shape and are complete.  Supposed to come with 36 spearmen there are at least 40 of each color.  There is one bent orage spearmen, but there are 41 of that color, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a spare.  Player shields have been used but are in great shape.  
Please see image of box cover in my personal gallery.  Additional photos available upon request.

    <notes>Version: Samurai Swords, reprint of Shogun
Condition: New in shrinkwrap, un-opened, in prestine condition. 
Very hard to find in this condition, the game looks just brought from the store!!!...
For collectors and gamers alike.
Buyer pays shipping, the total weight of the package weights 8 pounds, thus it will be expensive to ship.
$16 for parcel post (I always use delivery confirmation)
$22 for priority mail (I always use delivery confirmation)
The above price is for shipping within the US only. International shipping varies and will be very expensive.
Let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>Not Samurai Swords, but the older and rarer original release named Shogun.
This game might as well have fallen through a time warp from the late 1980s. It is almost Like New, but according to BGG definitions it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s VG. Two of the armies have not yet been de-bagged, all other components have been inventoried by hand and this game is 100% complete. Even the original baggies and attack counter sprues are still present.  It looks virtually unplayed, which is kind of sad really.
This game deserves better!
Contains at least these extra components: +2 Ronin, +1 Koku, +6 purple spearmen, +3 red spearmen, and +3 blue spearmen. The armies still in their original plastic bags have not been opened, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how many other extra miniatures there might be.
The box is in incredibly good shape for being more than 20 years old! It is in almost mint condition! One side panel has been slightly bleached by sunlight (I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even notice this at first). The box top has a bit of shelf wear on the very point of the corners.
Other than that, this looks like it has just been opened and played once (if that).
This is a big game and so shipping will be a bit pricey. Please contact me. Insurance is not required but recommended.
Priced to move!
Please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.</notes>

    <notes>It pains me to put this up for sale.  I love this game and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got more beautiful plastic than any game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve played but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played it once since I got it in 1999.  And I know I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve not got the time to give it it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s due, so here it goes to some lucky buyer with more time.
This is Samurai Swords, printed as Samurai Swords, not Shogun.  
The box sides is bowed some, and scratched a little, but functionable.  The game itself is in excellent condition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played once!
All parts are there and then some.  The four blank cards are still in the game as well as the extra spearmen and gunners MB threw in.  Most of the pieces have been taken off their plastic riders, and the screens have been folded, as it has been played once.
However, the sword holders were never separated, so you can pull those apart, and THERE IS NEARLY A WHOLE EXTRA _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;UNPUNCHED_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; GREEN ARMY!  This includes Army markers, daimyos, gunners and spearmen.  (Sorry no extra swordsmen or army stickers.)  Note the spearmen came _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pre-punched._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Own this classic in beautiful condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere, but you have to pay for shipping and explain how you want it shipped.
Please let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

game board good but a bit curved due to storage,
Instruction booklet none,
5 reference screens good shape, the green one has the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;take sword_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; torn off the cardboard,
5 army cards good shape, has some ink smudges on them, bent a bit, in middle, due to storage,
none Provience Cards,
5 planning and master trays are in good shape,
only 11 twelve sided black dice,
only 4 swords of five, and, one sword holder,
only 29 Koku coins,
only 9 castles and two bases for fortress setups,
no token for battle markers,
none Ninja,
Only four of five armies:
Orange Army: 5 Flagbearers, one with no flag (all flags in game are dirty), 2 Dyamiyos (one has helmet damage), 6 bowman, 7 swordsmen (one is damaged), 7 gunners, 30 spearmen (8 damaged),

One bit of weirdness, the green and blue flags are interchanged.  This would have zero effect on game play.</notes>

    <notes>the game components themselves are in excellent condition.  the game is 100% complete according to the rulebook.  there are a handful of broken miniatures, but since the game came with extras, each color still has a minimum of 75 unbroken miniatures (i counted).  the player boards are a bit bowed, but will straighten out with some attention.  so the game is in great condition.
the box on the other hand is a mess.  the art is peeling everywhere.  there are some rips and some tears.  amazingly, the box is still relatively strong, it isnt smashed, or misshapen.  some tape is holding down art on various corners and edges.

    <notes>***Very nice copy of this classic!!!***
Samurai Swords (MB Gamemaster Series): Same game as Shogun just upgraded and clearer rules. 101% complete (meaning it has more parts than originally came with the game) and has only been played twice by two adults. So it has been well cared for. The box is in pretty decent shape. It shows some wear from age and a few creases but is very much structurally sound. I would rate the box about a 7 out of 10 considering its age and the components a 9 out of 10 only because they are punched. 
Stored w/care in a smoke free home.

    <notes>This is a beautiful copy of the game, with no missing or broken pieces.  
All of the components look to be unplayed. The cards are beautiful with no wear, I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see a single broken figure in the box, the game board is flat and clean. There are plenty of extra pieces as well. See component list below.
The box is in very good shape. It has some very minor shelf wear, and about 1 inch of one edge is a little crushed. There is some very minor bowing on the cover. However, the box is sturdy and all the corners are in great shape. Considering how boxes for Gamemaster games usually look, this one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pretty nice.
Shipping is actual cost USPS (parcel or priority) from 22305.

    <notes>Only played once and I need to make room for new games.  All pieces are accounted for and in very good condition.  Units are separated and bagged, flag stickers applied, province and army cards are like new.  The box has minor corner indentation and edge scuffing, but still looks good.  
Shipping is via Canada Post regular/expedited parcel (actual cost to Canada, $20 flat to US).</notes>

    <notes>This is an excellent, like new copy. All pieces are inventoried 100% complete and in unplayed condition.
I obtained this game from a friend who received it new in shrink. He removed the shrink and sorted the pieces into a plano storage box, but the game itself has never been played.
The box itself looks new, with a tiny little nick on one edge.
Plano storage box included!</notes>

    <notes>Opened, complete, barely played (if at all). Some of the components (the Ronin, the red coins, the cards, the dice, and the foam bits) are unopened or unused. Armies are all bagged with the flag stickers attached.
Box has some light shelfwear and a slightly dinged corner, but is in pretty good condition overall.
Shipping is $10 in the continental US. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship to AK or HI at cost via USPS Parcel Post or Priority Mail (your preference). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship outside the US at cost, but be advised it will likely be expensive (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing at least $50).</notes>

All components including the board, cards, swords, screens, temples, dice, foam trays, and the many, many playing pieces are pretty much perfect and never been played. The box has some dishing and minor shelfwear. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. Shipping weight is 7 pounds.</notes>

    <notes>This is a steal of a deal :)
Everything is there (and more) and the game is in very good condition.  Only the box has some wear, which is not surprisng for an older game.  The corners are a bit scuffed and a couple of them have the beginnings of a split corner.
As far as the contents go, this game has hardly been played.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve counted every last piece and nothing is missing.  In fact there are a few extras:
There are 28 samurai (not 26)
There are extra spearmen in all the colours (this easily makes up for the few that have their spears broken)
There are 5 extra screens (in other words, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an entire extra set -- presumably from a second copy of the game!)
There are also 24 battle markers (rather than just 12)
There are 2 extra Koku.
This is a heavy game, so shipping will be a fair bit, but I will only charge actual shipping.  I would estimate that shipping in Canada would be around 20$.  To the US would be around 25-30$.  
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the Edmonton area you can pick up.

    <notes>Game:
German MB _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Shogun_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Edition.
Game box shows some minor wear, actually quite a good condition for its age. Game components are in very good condition. All miniatures are accounted for and nothing is broken. The swords and the ninja are here, too.
Since this is a rather old game, please ask for pictures before you buy!
Payment:
I accept bank transfer and, if you pick up the game directly, cash on delivery and paypal (buyer will have to pay paypal fees though).
Shipping:
I will ship to anywhere in the world. Buyer pays actual shipping costs.
International buyers please be aware, that shipping costs to locations outside the EU are quite high. To get a first quote, please look here: http://www.dhl.com
I will also ask international buyers to pay for shipping insurance.</notes>

    <notes>The game is 100% complete and is in excellent condition for its age, including all pieces. No game box damage; just very minor wear, as the photos show. I am the second owner but never had a chance to play the game. I have inventoried all of the pieces. I require a money order or cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s check to complete the transaction. Will provide a picture of the game in the shipping box to confirm it is being protected to your satisfaction. Can also e-mail pictures to your e-mail prior to shipment. In Seattle, I can meet to personally deliver the game. This is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Samurai Swords_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Edition.</notes>

This is for the version titled _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;SHOGUN_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and includes all 5 plastic katanas and all the original styrofoam trays. Really clean copy and damn fun to play.</notes>

    <notes>The gamebox has significant wear and the game components (cards, pieces) have some wear as well.  But the box is still sturdy and the game is in playable condition.  Overall, not bad as a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, but this is not something that a collector of pristine games would want.  </notes>

I travel frequently to Europe, and could ship it from The Netherlands. For shipments from Europe, the cost of the game is 62 Euros + shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>Unopened for decades! The box shows some wear and tear, but the components inside all look good. All five of the black plastic swords are still there, and I must say, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re still cool after all these years. The cards are starting to yellow a bit with age, but otherwise everything looks fine.  It appears the teenage version of myself did a good job of bagging the components. :) 
For added fun, I can see that I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t put all of the stickers on, and there is still a decal sheet with a few stickers left. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also a nice little ad for other Milton Bradley games. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s like opening a time capsule. Enjoy!
