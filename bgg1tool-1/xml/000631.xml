   <description>Six little plastic cars race around the big Daytona track.  The track is three spaces wide except for a sweeping curve at either end.  In the curves, the track narrows to two lanes.  The outer lane is a passing lane, requiring twice as many movement points to use and in which a car may not end its turn.  Movement points come from play of the special deck of cards.  Selecting a card from your hand, you move each of the cars on the card the prescribed number of spaces, trying to position your own car or cars most advantageously while leaving your opponents blocked.  Before each race, the six cars are auctioned off, and you bid for them based on the cards in your hand.  Payout is based on where your car(s) finished in the race.  Most money wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Suggested game length is three races (each race lasts about 20 minutes), enough to give the luck of the draw a chance to even out._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>DAYTONA 500 1990 Milton Bradley.  Complete with gameboard, 6 race cars, 48 cards, paper money, instructions.  Shipping weight is 4 pounds.  Game looks unplayed, so cards and all parts are in perfect condition, however the box bottom has some major splits and tears (but still holds together fine).  This game is Out-of-Print.</notes>

    <notes>Worn, used copy:
The box shows shelfwear, but is still intact.  The cars are all present, but the stickers were never applied and are no longer included.  The board is still in quite good condition.  Original rules are missing but scans are still available at Hasbro_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s website (link is on the Daytona 500 page here at the BGG).
Actual shipping cost (but, be forwarned: the box is awkwardly long, and somewhat heavy). Shipping for multiple items will be combined. Please contact me for the exact cost based on your location. I have little feedback here, but please see my ebay feedback for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;weadockfamily_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; if you are concerned.</notes>

    <notes>Cards have some wear - you can certainly still play with them, but I would probably use card protectors (probably a good idea anyway, as they are flimsy).  Cars do not have the stickers on them (doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play).  Box has some wear and the bottom is indented.</notes>

    <notes>This game is complete. The cars are the version without stickers, and the board has the incised grid pattern on it.
The board is in good shape, and the cars are in good shape. The box is still solid but with a paper coming up in one corner, some dishing, and lots of shelfwear.
The full set of cards have some bends on them all pretty similar in their amount of damage. I wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t able to remember one card from another from the backs, but I also never tried. The picture below shows one card (left) with typical damage, and another (right) with the most damage. All cards are fully readable.
This game is out of print.
Shipping will be priority mail, probably around $8-10 to the US. Give me your zip code and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you an exact amount.</notes>

The box is in ok condition but has surface wear, some minor corner wear and a slightly concaved box bottom.
The fully color instructions are included in great shape.
All 6 little cars are included in very good condition but some of the stickers are starting to peel a little.
Huge game board is in good condition but is slightly warped (which is common for this game).
Contains ALL 48 cards in great condition.
Money is included (Milton Bradley money of course).
U.S. buyers can pay with Google Checkout, Paypal, money orders or checks.  Shipping is $9.
International buyers must use Google Checkout or Paypal.  Shipping depends on location.

    <notes>Excellent condition. Extremely minor crease on back by corner, minor bowing of box side (i.e. it sticks out about 5 mm from side of bottom), minor 1 mm ding on side by corner. (Really not much. This box looks great.)
Includes 5 (perhaps 6 I do not remember) really nice metal miniature cars.
Paypal adds 4%. I am not opposed to outside US purchases, BUT purchases outside the USA must contact me directly before purchase so that we can discuss feasibility. It is a large flat game, so may be expensive to ship outside the USA.</notes>

    <notes>Daytona 500, still in original shrink!  Box has minor shelf wear, but excellent for a 20 year old game!  (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll happily send photos if requested.) A fantastic racing game, an early gem from Kramer that should not be missed.  Buyer to pay actual shipping costs, please message me for details or questions.  Due to length/width, UPS internation rates are in excess of $100, so shipping to US only, please</notes>

    <notes>Box shows shelf wear, corners have been taped, all parts accounted for. Stickers are still attached to cars but they are peeling up a bit. A little glue and TLC will fix that though. Box insert with Daytona 500 historical notes still in box too. 
I actually combined this set with another beat up thrift set so there is an additional set of cars (no stickers) and an almost complete set of movement cards included too. Everything is bagged and neatly organized.
Just needs a good home.</notes>

    <notes>Box lid has significant dishing, rubbing and wear.  The dishing is worst along the left side with creasing.  See photographs.  There are no split corners.
Game components are in very good shape.  The cars have the decals, and all 48 cards are present with no creasing or tears.  Money looks like it hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been used.
Will combine shipping on multiple items, and will ship internationally.</notes>

    <notes>** NOT FOR THE GAME **
This is for 6 replacement cars for use in game.
The replacement cars can be used in place of the original plastic cars that came with the game. These are third party production _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;NASCAR_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; style stock cars painted to resemble car from the time period of the Daytona 500 Board Game (Mid 1990_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s)
6 Cars are included, one to replace each original car from the base game - Black, Orange, Green, Yellow, Blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Red.
Buyer to pay shipping cost, I can provide an estimate. They will ship either in a small padded envelope or, worst case possible would be a small flat rate box with a lot of newspaper stuffed in.</notes>
