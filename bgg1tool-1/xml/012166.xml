    <notes>No. 82 of the limited first edition of Funkenschlag. Game has never been played. No shrinkwrap, but game doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t come with shrinkwrap originally.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Everything_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the box, including some Vis-A-Vis pens I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added. The only caveat is that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve carefully cut the original paper/plasticky board in half, so that it lies flat in the box. Also, I scanned the board and laminated the scans onto a folding board. Finally, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also another scan that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s simply laminated. Still, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the same great game it always has been, in really good shape.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new, never played, only opened the box once or twice.  Not listed as New because of the following:
Game was originally packed in a brown cardboard box with an outer sleeve.  The glue came loose on the outer sleeve and I repaired this with a strip of clear book binding tape.  
Buyer to pay shipping plus $3 handling fee to cover my costs to and from the post office.  I will ship internationally.

    <notes>In the original release, the map was folded semi-circularly around to fit in the box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve since laminated the map so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s now flat, but the downside is that it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the original game box unless you cut it in half. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll still fit in an A3 sized postage box that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s required to fit the game - then you can choose whether you wish to cut it to fit it into the game box or store it separately as I currently do. </notes>

    <notes>Funkenschlag, the original German version of Power Grid. Completely language-independent, and a printout of the English Rules are included. This is a used copy. The box shows some minor shelf wear, and one of the crayons is broken, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a crayon, so it still works and could be easily replaced. Otherwise, the game is complete and in Excellent condition.
Paypal, Check or M.O. only, will ship worldwide.  Buyer pays actual shipping cost from U.S. zip code 07946</notes>

    <notes>Cover nicked up but game has never been played. After collecting games over a number of years I have decided to reclaim a couple of closets I have a number of games for sale and would prefer to sell in groups when possible to cut down on shipping. If your in the New Orlean area I would be happy to meet up at one of the game groups game nights or if your a Gulf Gamer we can meet at the next convention if time is not important. </notes>

    <notes>First edition -- never played
Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!
