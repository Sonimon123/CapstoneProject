   <description>This description was originally based on a review from BoardgameNews.com._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this corporation-themed game, players compete to be the first to acquire four out of six possible victory points. You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;company chairman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;division heads_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The player who's the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;communications_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;hiring and relocating employees_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Awards: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Die Firma_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 35034)
In Power Struggle, players are angling, sneaking and backstabbing to climb the corporate ladder. Players compete for six possible victory points that represent various divisions of a large corporation. You may get a victory point for having 7 or more points on the influence track, or 8 or more points on the corruption track, or even beating your archenemy. In Power $truggle as in all large businesses, you have an archenemy...a person who represents the opposite of all you hold dear. Someone you are happy to have stare up at your boot heel as you walk right over him (or her). At the beginning of the game, that person doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re his archenemy, but something tells me it will become apparent soon enough. This time its not the generals who have all the fun... </notes>

    <notes>Game comes with double-sided personal custom player-aids I personally created and had not actually uploaded to the geek. Also included are 2 other FAQs and another rule aid.
Beautiful condition, and only played once or twice. Very well taken care of.
Comes from a Smoke-Free home.
