   <description>Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a PRE ORDER for Star Wars Imperial Assault. The expected date is unclear at the moment - sometimes we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re told late November, sometimes mid-December, sometimes January 2015... as soon as I have an update I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll post here and also notify everybody that has pre-ordered.
To pre-order you can either _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; it here on the marketplace or just send me a PM on boardgamegeek. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to know your delivery address, how you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pay (PayPal or bank transfer) and your email address. Once our stock is confirmed and on it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s way to our warehouse I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll then get in touch re payment and then ship the game out to you as quickly as possible. In the event that stocks are limited then the earliest placed orders will be honored first, anybody too late in the queue will be notified as soon as possible and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to help out with some alternative options (e.g. if we have an ETA for a second wave of stock).
Happy shopping!

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGSWI01)
Imperial Assault casts you and your friends into the climatic events following the Death Star’s destruction above Yavin 4, and offers two full game experiences within the Star Wars saga. In the campaign game, you and up to four other friends play a series of thrilling missions woven together in a narrative campaign, and in the skirmish game, you and your opponent muster your own strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives. Whether you play as a hero of the Rebellion and fight alongside iconic characters like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, or command the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, you’ll enter the Star Wars universe in Imperial Assault. As an added bonus, Imperial Assault includes the Darth Vader Villain Pack and the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack. These figure packs mark the first expansions for Imperial Assault, adding sculpted plastic figures with new campaign and skirmish missions.</notes>

Whether you play as a hero of the Rebellion and fight alongside iconic characters like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, or command the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, you’ll enter the Star Wars universe in Imperial Assault. As an added bonus, Imperial Assault includes the Darth Vader Villain Pack and the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack. These figure packs mark the first expansions for Imperial Assault, adding sculpted plastic figures with new campaign and skirmish missions.</notes>

    <notes>Hello - I purchased a copy, played it once and can say it is not to my taste.  Everything is in great condition but most counters have been punched.  The original insert got tossed (completely useless once the game is punched and figures are assembled.
I am in the SF Bay Area (Palo Alto) so you can save shipping and I can save PayPal fees if you want to meet up.
Cheers,

    <notes>Okay long story on this one........
Up for auction is one used but somewhat damaged Imperial Assault game....the game has the following defects
The box is gone I got this game from my brother, whose dog ate the box...when I got the game I conducted an inventory and all pieces of the game are there...it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just missing the box....
The other item that is damaged are 2 of the probe droids...once again my brother_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s son broke these off the base and they have been glued back on......
Some of the miniatures are painted, some good, some not so good, but this would be easily fixed with Simply Green..
I want to get rid of the game, cheap, because i know there are people out there that want it and this would be a good way to get it.   I tried this game with my gaming group and it was not a hit, so luck to you the lucky bidder....the only thing missing from this IS THE GAME BOX...OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS COMPLETELy intact.....
PLus it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cheap and a good way to get into it....</notes>

    <notes>I am selling the base set plus all the expansions from Wave 1 through 5 (Twin Shadows, Return to Hoth and every single small expansion pack), so everything up to, but not including, the Bespin Gambit and its four expansion packs.
There is also an extra pair of dice.
Condition is like new (everything has been opened but never played with).
Price includes shipping to the UK.
The only thing that needs to be mentioned is that the two front guns on the AT-ST broke during assembly. However, since the General Weiss pack is included in this lot (and is in pristine condition), you can easily use that one as your base AT-ST (the default assembly is the general_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s enhanced walker, but if you remove a couple of pieces you get the exact model that came in the base set).
Brand new, this lot would set you back about three hundred pounds. So I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m knocking a hundred and ten pounds off because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not shrink-wrapped and because the two guns broke off during assembly.
And again, shipping is included (for the UK only).
Payment by PayPal or bank transfer.
Any questions, please ask.</notes>

    <notes>This sale includes ALL Imperial Assault Releases up to but not including the Bespin Gambit cycle.  No pieces are missing or damaged, though some packaging was kept.   All pieces are conveniently sorted and bagged. 
All were bought new, lightly played and kept in a smoke-free home.   My purchase price through CoolStuffInc was $313. 27 for all of this, and this purchase was made before the recent Asmodee/ FFG price increase so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pass those savings on to you. 
I’m discounting my cost by 30% for a grand total of $220 plus free economy shipping.  This is a great deal, and I won’t go any lower. And please do not ask for international shipping.
I can send you a copy of my CSI invoices if you wish to verify my purchase price and inventory; send me your email address and I’ll reply with it attached.</notes>

    <notes>Important info about this listing:
-All tokens and map pieces are punched, sorted, and in very good condition.  All of the group ID stickers are still on the sheet, unused.  Box is in great condition, with very minimal wear.
-Includes Darth Vader _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Luke Skywalker character packs (as did all first editions, I believe).
-Includes the Han Solo character pack.
-Includes rules (v1.0.6) and professionally printed cards for RedJak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Automated Emperor Variant, available on BGG.
-The two Probe Droid figured were damaged when I received the game, and I have not attempted to repair them for fear of botching the glue job.  One is completely detached from its base, and the other is holding on by 2 out of 3 legs.  I will ensure that these are packed carefully when shipping your game.
-I have not attached the AT-ST chin-mounted gun, as I am not comfortable applying the amount of pressure that seems necessary to make this work.</notes>

I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keep the expansion clam shells, but I did keep the instructions and other expansion components.  Fully painted to a very high standard.  Big box means it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in a USPS box.  So Fedex fully insured will be $24.</notes>

    <notes>Played once. AT-ST assembled for you.  Removed the cheap cardboard insert that comes with most FFG stuff, otherwise, it is mint condition. Added plastic containers for all the pieces, you can do with those as you please.  Will do $10.00 straight up for shipping, unless it is less than that, I will then refund you anything underneath the $10.00 (but I doubt it will be less than $10.00) (This shipping quote also applies only to continental USA, anything outside that will have to be at cost). Thanks.</notes>

It was tons of fun, but just too hard to commit to playing the campaign for our group.</notes>

    <notes>This game has not been played or punched. I have cared for it well. 
Please note that I am selling couple of other Star Wars items, that are in Like New condition (General Weiss and Rebel Saboteurs). So make an offer for them if you want them with this game. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cut you a deal on the two additional figures. To me, it is simply Descent in a Star Wars Universe and I am culling my collection of these type of hack and slash games. I am simply not going to play them much.
I will ship in USA using USPS. I will send it as cheaply as possible. Do not ask for a shipping estimate. I am not making two trips to the Post Office. Once you place your order I will get the shipping estimate and send it to you.  Depending where you live, shipping will likely be between $10-16 dollars although the weight of the game can be a factor. This game will not fit in the standard USPS flat rate boxes (sorry).
I will send it elsewhere in the world, but do not expect the shipping to be cheap. Sending things to the Pacific (Asia) seems to be more expensive than Europe.</notes>

    <notes>Kids off to college, moving over-seas to start a B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;B... just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time for board-games these days. Wish I had more time because board-games are awesome!
This game was only played twice.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s actually BETTER THAN NEW because A.) everything is punched and separated into zip-lock baggies and B.) I built a little marker separater that fits right into the box.
$50 for the game + $20 for shipping (regular ground) = total $70 (USD)
If you want some other type of shipping other than regular ground, the shipping cost will of course be higher.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game for lack of time and I hope next owner will give it love and table time it deserves. There is always another Jedi or Sith to follow the ways of the force.
All images are here: http://imgur.com/a/TnA9O
This copy got so much love and upgrades before it even got played once that I highly doubt you will lose which ever side you play, really.
Condition is top notched. Core game hit table few times for few scenarios. Bespin and Hoth map parts are still on the punch board, only status token have been removed. I wanted to see if they will fit in condition tray. Skirmish, character, agenda cards have been nicely organized in Ultra-pro binder. Imperial Class cards and other small cards in the dedicated card organized. All proof of purchase is present. Everything is sleeved in sleeves right of the box. RAEV 2.0.1
Please get in touch with me before purchasing to confirm shipping details etc. I really want to make sure this game finds new happy owner it deserves.
There are several things which makes this lot unique on BGG marketplace.
1) Everything has been rebased on acrylic bases. AT-ST included
2) Every unit is painted and each squad has marks on the model so you can easily tell one from another. 
3) One and only in the world organizer. I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find one on the market that would really fit my taste so me and my friend invented new one. Core box fits 120 of 1 square minis and it’s as flexible as you can imagine with removable walls, and extra height for tall minis in 4 trays and you can easily get it outside of the box with the help of 2 notches on each side of tray.
4) Custom damage dialers for cards. Run you skirmishes faster. 6 of them, but only 2 assembled.

    <notes>[b]Star Wars Imperial Assault MEGA Set[/b]
* Includes EVERYTHING published up through one wave ago (described below)
* All cards in PREMIUM sleeves
* Nearly half the collection is PAINTED to a high quality tabletop level
* Several alternative art PROMOS from organized play prizes
This lot contains a massive collection of Imperial Assault content from the starter box all the way up through Jabba_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Realm. Everything is very well card for and most of it is completely unplayed. All the cards are sleeved in FFG_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s premium grade sleeves for maximum protection and easy shuffling.
I spent dozens of hours painting many of the miniatures of the set. Nearly half are complete and are protected so they can be handled by players. They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re stored in a miniature storage box to keep the paint jobs pristine.
Finally there are several alternative art promos that were prizes from organized play events. Many are rare if not impossible to find anymore. This is an $800+ retail value NOT including the promos or painting. With the new Imperial Assault campaign app ready to go, this is an ideal way to get going!

    <notes>The game is as new. It was never played and comes with a custom insert that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve made, with several trays to store all the content. Contact me so that I can send you pictures of the insert. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it because I will not have a chance to play it with my current game group and I need to clear shelf space. 
I will ship anywhere in Europe, inquire for price estimate. 
It is possible to pick the game up in person in Brussels, Belgium.
Trust issues?
So, you are wondering: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;can I trust this guy, he only sold few things here in the market! Can I trust him?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Well, you can. In fact these are the first items I sell on the geekmarket, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only now starting. Despite that, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a regular BGG user with love for boardgames and in a mission to spread them.

    <notes>This is for an Imperial Assault lot, which includes:
*Imperial Assault Core Box, Luke _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Darth Vader _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bonus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; minis (Online retailer ~$75)
*Return to Hoth - big box expansion (Online retailer ~$46)
*Jabba_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Realm - big box expansion (Online retailer ~$49)
I played through the Legends of the Alliance campaign (1) time (~3-5 sessions). The small bits are packed in a large Plano for organization. All items are in excellent condition with one exception: The hero sheets from the Jabba_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s realm expansion have a few dimples on them from the Rancor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s spikes - it was tightly packed in the box when I bought it new (no tearing or image removed, more like embossing - still very much useable - I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve tried to highlight this in the third photo).
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re OK with discarding the expansion boxes, I can fit all of the game play material in the core box. *Shipping will be $19 (USPS Flat Rate).* I will assume that this is preferred unless you note otherwise.
If you want the expansion boxes, please geekmail me your ZIP code so that I can quote you a shipping price (Expect a significantly higher shipping price due to size _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; weight).
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including following figure add-ons:
- Chewbacca
- Assassin Droid
- Han Solo
- Royal Guard Champion
- R2D2 and C3PO.
Everything is in good order, nothing is missing and box is in a good shape. When the original owner got the game, two of the drones were broken and he had to get new replacements from FFG (original broken minis and the replacements are all included). All miniatures are in Plano boxes now. 
It also includes a Vader and Luke which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure sure whether they came with the base set.
Ii also includes a custom card box for the cards.
Buyer pays actual postage but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cap the amount at $18. There is a lot of stuff here so unless you live very close expect to pay $18.</notes>

    <notes>OK while the components themselves are in very good condition, this is missing cards/minis. Basically when this came out I bought it and gave it to a friend to paint. As expansions came out I kept picking them up and sending them to him. He, shall we say, got very behind and it was almost 2 years before I finally gave up and demanded he return my game. I then found out why he was taking so long: He lost some of the bits. I unfortunately have no idea what is even left in my game which is why I am throwing this up at what is essentially a huge loss for me. So why would you pay for this item given it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s incomplete status? Well first off, I am including the BattleFoam case designed for Imperial Assault. Since I was going ahead and paying to get my mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s painted I wanted a good case to keep them in to protect that paint. Secondly, there is well over $300 worth of Imperial Assault here alone. and about 2/3rds of it has been painted, which even at a very conservative $3/mini comes out to just under $150 in painting. I took photos of pretty much everything I still have so you can see exactly what you would be getting. If you would like any further detail shots on any of the miniatures I would be happy to provide them.  All but 2 of the Character Cards were laminated, all cards were sleeved, and there is an extra set of dice included as well. According to my Collection here on BGG, here is what I bought:
Star Wars: Imperial Assault (2014)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Alliance Smuggler Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Bantha Rider Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Boba Fett Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Bossk Villain Pack (2016)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Chewbacca Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Dengar Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – General Sorin Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Greedo Villain Pack (2016)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Han Solo Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Hired Guns Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – IG-88 Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – ISB Infiltrators Villain Pack (2016)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Kayn Somos Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Lando Calrissian Ally Pack (2016)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Leia Organa Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Obi-Wan Kenobi Ally Pack (2016)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – R2-D2 and C-3PO Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Rebel Saboteurs Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Rebel Troopers Ally Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Return to Hoth (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Royal Guard Champion Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Stormtroopers Villain Pack (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – The Grand Inquisitor Villain Pack (2016)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Twin Shadows (2015)
Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Wookiee Warriors Ally Pack
I wish I could be more confident in what is actually in here, but given it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s priced for basically the case and the paint work, it can be a nice way to get a jump start on getting your own collection painted while getting a spiffy case that will hold everything to boot! Everything pictured is included! And wow I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t realize there was a limit to the number of images that could be posted/displayed on a BGG Marketplace listing so you can see all the photos I took here: https://imgur.com/a/wkSiCLV
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 14 pounds so figure an extra pound or few of packing material. This will also not fit into a Flat Rate Box so expect shipping in t he $30-40 range for the Continental US.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:

    <notes>Some shelfwear on the box around the edges.  All cards are sleeved.  I made a custom insert for this game.  It was the first I ever made - it’s a little wonky and the lid pops up a bit with all the manuals.  The minis are also painted.  They were the first minis I painted, so they’re a little rough, but I’d give them a passing grade.
Depending on where you live shipping costs $12-20.  Feel free to ask for the exact cost.  Games get mailed USPS Priority and typically go out the business day after payment is received.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game plus a number of expansions (both big box and small/individual expansions) all housed in the base game box.  Some minis have been fully painted and some have just base coat applied.  
NOTE:  This is a placeholder for now, and I will update it with the exact contents and pics of the painted minis later.  
IF, however, anyone wants to take a flyer on it for the time being at this price, please feel free to do so.  I guarantee the lot is worth much more than the ask - and the minis that have been painted are done quite well (not _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;professional_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, but I would call them very good to great quality paint job and they are more than serviceable to use).  The price for this lot will likely go up once I recall how much is actually included.</notes>
