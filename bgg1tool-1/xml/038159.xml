   <description>Your quiet little 16th century village has suddenly become infested with some very unfriendly werewolves...can you and the other villagers find them before they devour everyone?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition is the ultimate party game for anywhere from 5 to 68 players of all ages.

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZUWU4)
Your quiet little 16th century village has suddenly become infested with some very unfriendly werewolves...can you and the other villagers find them before they devour everyone? Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition is the ultimate party game for anywhere from 5 to 68 players of all ages. Each player has an agenda: as a villager, hunt down the werewolves; as a werewolf, convince the other villagers that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re innocent, while secretly dining on those same villagers each night. Dozens of special roles are available to help both the villagers and the werewolves achieve their goals while thwarting their opponents. </notes>

    <notes>I am selling the Pegasus promotional pack for Werewolf, fully playable for up to 10 players (one being the story teller), containing a limited number of cards from the game.
This item is unplayed and still in shrink. The card text is German.
Buyer pays for shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to send this as cheap as possible to you. I expect that the shipping costs will be about 0.90 EUR for Germany and 1.50 EUR international. You can combine shipping for multiple items ordered from me.
Payment by money order (preferred) or by PayPal. Fees for PayPal to be paid by the buyer (add 4% of the final price if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how to pay the PayPal fees yourself).</notes>

    <notes>Game is in good condition. All cards are crisp except for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Idiot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card, which has 2 dinged top corners for some reason--perhaps Bezier could replace it.
