   <description>Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;rule_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;0_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, you must say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Loco!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns. In 2014, Gryphon Games released a new edition of this game as Wildlife Safari, featuring the same components and artwork but changing the title of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Milton Bradley_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Quandary in excellent condition.  This is the older, fancier and much nicer version of Loco! with the bakelite pieces.  Pieces look great.  Everything is crisp.  The board seems to have been bent slightly in the opposite direction of the crease to make it lay flat, but there are no tears.  Minor box wear.

    <notes>Quandary version - box has some wear but components look very nice. Game was received unplayed but there was a tile swap in coallating. There is a duplicate blue five and no blue zero. I marked one of the fives with a small dot of figernail polish to denote the zero tile. Mint copies of this version go for 70+ on EBay. This is my favorite version of Loco.

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY 101268N)
On safari in Botswana, you might be able to spot lions, rhinos, elephants, leopards, and zebras. In this game, you will spot them for sure! But can you guess which ones will be worth the most at the end of this safari? Play the right cards at the right time, collect the best animals, score the most points and win the game. Botswana has easy and quick rules, it is fast to learn and yet challenging to play - for all family members young and old. This is the latest addition, #11, in the popular Gryphon Bookshelf Series of family games. You’ll want to collect them all for a never-ending supply of quick, challenging, fun family activities; whether at home or on-the-road! This game easily adapts and therefore plays well for 2 to 5 players by simply adjusting the number of cards in the playing deck.</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY101268N)
On safari in Botswana, you might be able to spot lions, rhinos, elephants, leopards, and zebras. In this game, you will spot them for sure! But can you guess which ones will be worth the most at the end of this safari? Play the right cards at the right time, collect the best animals, score the most points and win the game. Botswana has easy and quick rules, it is fast to learn and yet challenging to play-for all family members young and old. </notes>
