   <description>Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ask questions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;code_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;perfect knowledge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Winning Moves edition--the one in the Square box.  The box itself  is smaller than the box for the Milton Bradley edition, but the game is otherwise identical.  Note that the new English edition from Fantasy Flight is a different game: it is just a card game, and does not have the board or the strang plastic randomizing device.  The one I am selling has everything, and is in excellent condition.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also consider trades--see my want list.</notes>

    <notes>This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;original_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; german big box (big map :) edition by MB.
Just a little wear to the corners/edges of the box. Inside everything there and in very good condition. Looking at the sheets that are still left the game has hardly been played.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.30€ worldwide and 8.20€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.
Warning! Shipping this game might be tough. If you want it to be shipped as a 12.30 € package I can only wrap it into packaging paper as it would be too big otherwise. So better combine it with the purchase of other games into a bigger box.</notes>

    <notes>Ares Games (AREU002)
Will you be able to recognize your ally and confound your foes? Will you be able to recognize your ally and confound your foes? The night is filled with cheerful jubilation, wild rejoicing, singing, and laughter... and well-disguised, costumed characters scurry through narrow alleyways. Intermingled with the crowd in this festive atmosphere are four special characters, true masters of deception. They are capable of disguising themselves to be unrecognizable, as they sneak through the night on their secret missions. Will you be able to figure out who your partner is, and exchange with him or her the secret code that reveals your mission? Will you be able to bluff your opponents and hide your identity to prevent them from fulfilling their secret goal? Inkognito is a great Classic, and finally it comes back with a new look and with a new and exciting 5-players variant. Inkognito is a deduction game for 3 to 5 players set in Venice, in a romantic age of spies, microfilms, hot-air balloons and fast speedboats. As a secret agent, or the mysterious Ambassador, you will have to collect clues, use your deduction skills to recognize your friends and confound your foes, and discover the secret mission that will give victory to your team. </notes>
