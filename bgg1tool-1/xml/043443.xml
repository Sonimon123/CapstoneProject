   <description>The forest is filled with all sorts of monsters. They watched and waited as you built your castle and trained your soldiers, but now they've gathered their army and are marching out of the woods. Can you work with your friends to defend your castle against the horde, or will the monsters tear down your walls and destroy the precious castle towers? You will all win or lose together, but in the end only one player will be declared the Master Slayer!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Castle Panic is a cooperative, light strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer.

The forest is filled with all sorts of Monsters. They watched and waited as you built your Castle and trained your soldiers, but now they’ve gathered their army and are marching out of the woods.

Castle Panic is a unique, cooperative strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. 
Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest, at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. 
Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.

    <notes>The forest is filled with all sorts of
Monsters. They watched and waited as
you built your Castle and trained your
soldiers - but now they’ve gathered their
army and are marching out of the woods!
Can you work with your friends to defend
your Castle against the horde, or will the
Monsters tear down your walls and
destroy the precious Castle Towers? You
will all win or lose together, but in the end
only one player will be declared the
Master Slayer! Scheduled to ship in
September 2009.
PSI FSD1001............................$35.00
IN STOCK!
ORDER THIS HOT GAME NOW! MSRP is $35, pay just $23.95 and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be confused by other people_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s strange shipping prices and long drawn out quotes. Shipping of just $9.95 nationwide.
Combined shipping is easy and encouraged! Just checkout and we will confirm it with combined shipping as noted in our rules below. Basically 100% shipping on the first game and 50% shipping on the rest, or better.
Yes we can combine orders at significant shipping discounts.
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Combined shipping works as follows for domestic (48 lower states) orders:
Highest price shipping item: Full shipping cost
2nd-4th highest priced items: 50% off shipping cost for each of these items.
5th-10th highest priced shipping items: 60% off shipping costs for each of these items.
11th+ highest priced shipping items: 75% off shipping for all the rest of the items.
As an example say you purchased 15 games, 3 of them with $10 shipping, 5 of them with $8 shipping and 7 of them with $4 shipping. The total shipping for the 15 items would be:
Full shipping on the first item: $10.00
50% off shipping on items 2-4: $14.00 (50% off $10, $10 and $8, the next highest shipping cost items)
60% off shipping on items 5-10: $14.40 (60% off of 3 items at $8 shipping and 3 more items at $4 shipping = $36)
75% off shipping on items 11-15: $4.00 (75% off 4 items at $4)
Total shipping on these 15 items then would be $10+$14+$14.40 + $4 = $42.40 shipping. This is just an example and your results will vary depending on what you buy of course!</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Castle Panic
Description: Used, complete and in great shape.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>Fireside Games (FSD1001)
 
Castle Panic is a unique, cooperative strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest, at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win. </notes>

    <notes>Pristine condition, only played once, includes Crossbow promo _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;coaster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Original insert is gone, instead I have a great Plano (plastic) container that holds the cards, tokens, walls, etc.  Unfortunately it is expensive: if you want the Plano case, please let me know and add $8 for replacement cost.  Otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll transfer the contents to baggies.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). I pack my game carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

Castle Panic is a unique, cooperative strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest, at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win. </notes>

    <notes>Fireside Games (FSD1001)
Castle Panic is a unique, cooperative strategy game for 1 to 6 players ages 10 and up. Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest, at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.</notes>

    <notes>Components are in very good condition. Box and insert are in good condition, with some whitening to box corners and a 5” split along one edge of the box base (box is still sturdy though).
The box says this is a First Edition from 2010. It doesn’t say which printing it is, so I’ve put 2nd printing as a guess.
Shipping within the UK will cost £3 via Royal Mail.</notes>
