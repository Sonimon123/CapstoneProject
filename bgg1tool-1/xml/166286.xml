    <notes>This is a great game that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get to play very much. All of the game components (cards, dice, tokens, meeples, board, rules, player aids, box etc) are in super condition. I actually played the game twice but always with care, on a green baize cloth. I am very picky about game condition and I would be very happy to receive this game.
Packing and Delivery:-
UK - £4.00
EU - GeekMail me with destination country and I will get a quote.
I would estimate between £5 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; £10
I am also selling the Big League Support expansion, the Sentinels of the 9th expansion and the Season 1 Promo Pack expansion separately, here on BGG Marketplace.</notes>
