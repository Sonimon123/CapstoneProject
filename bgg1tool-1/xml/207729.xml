   <description>The Edge: Dawnfall is a dynamic, miniature and card battle game with elements of territory control (gathering crystals) as well as campaign play. Each player controls unique units with special abilities that can be enchanted with special spell or progress cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players win the game in solo or co-op mode by completing plot conditions of the scenario, or in the competitive skirmish mode by gaining advantage of 7 Victory Points. The game is set in the original post-apocalyptic universe of The Edge and features 6 factions with very different backstories, game styles and aesthetics._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is for one Warchest (includes all six factions) and the Darkness stretch goals, which includes the Bell Crow and Abyssal Empress (both the Bell Crow and Abyssal Empress are inside the Darkness box). The Darkness box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s plastic wrap was removed so that I could insert the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Campaign Secret Envelope_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; that was included in my shipment that is meant to be opened after completing the three campaigns. The Darkness box has an empty slot in its plastic tray that is normally occupied by the Prime Shadow, but the Prime Shadow was an add-on, not a stretch goal, so it is not included. No add-ons are included.
They are in hand and ready to ship.</notes>

    <notes>This is the war chest.
Great Condition, played only a few times for review. No mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s broken, which can happen even with new versions. 
Mostly sleeved, used high quality FFG sleeves. Will include several packs to continue with sleeving. 
Removed awful box inserts, and will bag each faction and pack well. 
Comes with the Darkness Expansion, Solo Campaign, and 3 competitive campaigns. Sticker Sheets still bound and untouched.</notes>
