   <description>Prophecy (originally released as Proroctv_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;iacute;) is a Talisman-style game by Czech designer Vladim_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;iacute;r Chv_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;aacute;til. The players represent fantasy characters on a path through a land full of adventure with the goal of grabbing ancient artifacts from the claws of demons guarding the surrounding astral realms._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Instead of rolling dice to move around the game board, players in Prophecy use a variety of means of transport. The game includes an experience system and loads of skills and spells that your character can learn. A large number of monsters that you can meet and fight also await you, as do random events that will keep taxing your abilities because after you cast a spell or lose a fight, your strength or willpower declines until it is recharged by healing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Whoever holds four of the five hidden artifacts wins the game and becomes the next king of the land._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;      Prophecy: Dragon Realm (2003)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;      Prophecy: Water Realm (2006)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Too many games.  Too little time.  Played a few rounds and although good reviews but not likely to play again.  I think I prefer the simplicity of Talisman.  Fewer cards.

    <notes>Zman Games - Prophecy
Language: English
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 12+
Duration: about 180 min
Weight: 2.200 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Prophecy is a Talisman-style game by the Czech game designer Vladimír Chvátil. The players represent fantasy characters on their route through the land full of adventure with a goal of grabbing ancient artefacts from the claws of demons guarding surrounding astral realms. The one holding four out of five hidden artefacts is the winner and a next king of the land. Imagine the Talisman style of moving your character around the game board, this time not by dice rolling, but by using different means of transport. The game includes a system of experience and loads of skills and spells your character can learn on a various spaces of the land. Of course, there are quite a large number of monsters that you can meet and fight and many random events that you might face. The system of combat is also interesting - after you lose the fight or you cast a spell, your strength or your willpower declines until it is recharged by some healing.

    <notes>Z-Man, not Altar, edition. Played three times tops: I loved it, but it hit a certain _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;samey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; note with a lot of fantasy/race games our group was already into (Runebound, for instance). I can arrange a meet with Montrealers to save them shipping costs (but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m only in town once or twice a month on weekends); other buyers, tell me how you want it delivered via Canada Post from postal code J1H 2W5 and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll honor your request after I confirm the shipping rates for your total. </notes>

Prophecy
English. Very good condition, only played solo once to try out. Need a new home!
Postage to UK: £7.5 (heavy)
Postage elsewhere: please contact me beforehand but know that a fully boxed package will weigh above 2kgs and it has to ship via courier with cost anywhere between £30-60 unfortunately. Other risky possibility would be to split the game and ship 2 parcels, which would then come down to between £17-20 shipping altogether.</notes>

English rules and game texts.
All game parts are punched but still in mint condition. Box shows quite a few shelf wear!
Shipping:
All shipping is done via DHL. Shipping costs depend on size and weight of the parcel and destination.

    <notes>English Z-Man edition, PLUS, English Z-Man edition of the Dragon Realm expansion (No box for Dragon Realm).  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the second owner, and would guess it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played 5-10 times.  All components in excellent condition except for the turn summary boards, which have moderate wear around the edges.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d give it as a gift, so overall it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in BGG Very Good condition.
The package is approx 6 lbs. I can ship this to you, insured, for $10-20, depending on how far you are from me (Indiana). This might fit in a USPS flat rate box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take paypal or USPS money orders.</notes>

    <notes>Altar Version (+ expansion if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested, see below)
Game is complete, has been played, taken care of, and all components are in great condition.
Included are printouts with the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;quick start_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; variants, giving characters a few starting items and skills.  I think this variant helps the theme, as the starting items are thematically tied to the character; and the variant speeds up the game since you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not quite so puny and defenseless to start.
The box shows wear along the corners and some edges.  Three corners have been carefully taped from the inside as I feared the corners would start splitting.
Bonus! For an extra $4, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include the Dragon Realm expansion, new in shrink.  This will fit inside the base game box, and not really effect shipping costs!
Let me know if you have any questions/concerns, or would like a shipping estimate.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Z-Man Games edition. Played a handful of times, but still in great condition. There is a very minor dent on the bottom edge of the face of the box lid and a minor corner ding on the lid base.
Let me know if you have any questions about the game.

    <notes>[b]BUNDLE: Base game + Dragon Realm + Water Realm.[/b]
2007 Z-Man Second Edition of the Prophecy base game (which is the uncensored version with the original, oh-so-controversial bare=breasted artwork on the Succubus and Harpies cards), the Dragon Realm expansion, the Water Realm expansion, and several nice fan-made player aids.
Water Realm is brand new in factory shrink.
The components of Dragon Realm are essentially brand new (unpunched tokens, factory-sealed cards: see photos), but I threw away the box for Dragon Realm since the components fit in the base game box.
The base game box and components are complete and in excellent condition. The rulebook has some (sensible, in my opinion) underlining in it.
Includes a couple laminated copies of the fantastic UniversalHead fan-made player aids. Includes some printed out variant rules. Includes a laminated side board to hold the displayed Guild Cards (which otherwise tend to make the board a bit crowded).</notes>
