   <description>In Battlestations, you and your friends each play the role of a crew member on a starship that faces whatever grief the Enemy player throws at you. You'll blast enemies, pull outrageous maneuvers, unlock the secrets of alien cultures, and crank the last bit of juice out of an overtaxed engine while trying not to get yourself, your crew, or your starship blown to bits in the process._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In more detail, one player acts in the role of The Enemy and controls aliens, evil characters and any surprises that will come up. The other players take the role of starship crew. Players first build a ship with various tiles, with each tile representing a different location on a ship, such as a bridge, engine room, torpedo room, teleporter room, etc. Players can go to the appropriate room to take the designated action. At the same time, the game is played on a second board representing the space around the ship. The game is played in scenarios. The goal of the game is to complete the scenario specific mission. The crew will win, as a team, if the scenario goals are accomplished._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Gorilla Games (OOC 0802)
Battlestations allows players to operate a star ship acting as the crew. Players can be a Marine, Pilot, Scientist or Engineer. They move about the ship drawing power from the engines and putting it into guns, shields and helm. They can fire missiles and cannons at enemy ships. The ship can be maneuvered through asteroid filled battlefields. Scanning for information and using electric counter measures are all part of the action.
The game uses two types of boards, both using tiles to build an large number of different designs. One board is made up of a black hex map and ship/planet tokens track where everything is in relation to each other in space. The other tiles are used to build a space ship which can be a scout or a full planet bombarding dreadnought. The players place their character on the tiles forming the ship and move them around to operate the components from engines to hyper-drives to science bays to guns.
Fight from a distance or close in and conduct boarding actions. Recreate major space battles, or challenge players by forcing them to fight off a pirate incursion with pistols and rifles.

    <notes>Acquired in trade - has been played but still in good condition - almost new in fact.
All present except missing 8 (of 128) fold out cardboard heroes. Given the 120 I have are uncut, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m missing 1 sheet of 8 bots/character - the sheet with the 4 bots, 1 human, and 3 other (bots?). You could make your own by copying one of the other ones there so should be no impact on the game - not sure even if you need 128 characters ....
Will accept direct deposit from Australian buyers.</notes>

    <notes>Gorilla Games (OOC 0802)
Battlestations allows players to operate a star ship acting as the crew. Players can be a Marine, Pilot, Scientist or Engineer. They move about the ship drawing power from the engines and putting it into guns, shields and helm. They can fire missiles and cannons at enemy ships. The ship can be maneuvered through asteroid filled battlefields. Scanning for information and using electric counter measures are all part of the action.
The game uses two types of boards, both using tiles to build an large number of different designs. One board is made up of a black hex map and ship/planet tokens track where everything is in relation to each other in space. The other tiles are used to build a space ship which can be a scout or a full planet bombarding dreadnought. The players place their character on the tiles forming the ship and move them around to operate the components from engines to hyper-drives to science bays to guns.
Fight from a distance or close in and conduct boarding actions. Recreate major space battles, or challenge players by forcing them to fight off a pirate incursion with pistols and rifles.</notes>

Are you a hero? You and your crewmates man the battlestations of a working starship, moving around on the module layout to maneuver your ship on the hex map. You turn the ship in the Helm, you pump for power back in the Engines. Experience simultaneous ship-to-ship combat and boarding action! Battlestations is a character-based adventure game of simultaneous ship-to-ship and boarding combat in space. Players work together against the forces controlled by the referee. Battlestations can be played as one-off missions or as part of an ongoing campaign. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll track character_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s positions on the spaceship layouts and the ships_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; positions on the hex map. The action in Battlestations is literally character driven. If you want the ship to turn or speed up, a character has to take an action to make is so. If you want the ship_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s guns to fire at an enemy ship, a character has to take an action to fire the guns. The 2008 Revised edition is fully compatible with all Battlestations products. </notes>

    <notes>Version 1.0 rules. Game has never been played, although some of the counters have been punched. Game is complete and everything is in pristine condition, in fact the box has almost no shelf wear which is great considering its age.
Due to the unusual size of the box, US shipping will be actual cost (probably $10-$20). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>Ich verkaufe hier die unbespielte 1ste Edition des Spieles _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Battlestations_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; von Gorilla Games.
ACHTUNG: Dieses Spiel existiert nur in einer englischen Version und um die geht es hier, ABER als Bonus liegt dieser Version eine komplette inoffizielle DEUTSCHE Anleitung bei. Außerdem habe ich 8 einlaminierte DEUTSCHE Charakterbögen erstellt und beigelegt.
Ich habe das Spiel leider in meiner Gruppe nie spielen können und deswegen ist auch alles in einwandfreiem Zustand. Die meisten Pappminis sind noch nicht einmal aus Ihren Bögen entfernt.
---
Unplayed Version with additional printed fanmade german rulebook and sheets. Only a few of the cardboard markers are cut out.</notes>
