   <description>In the Florence of the 12th-14th centuries, the city's powerful and influential families don't just compete with each other in trade and politics. They also try to outdo one another by building tall, mostly square-based tower homes as status symbols._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Firenze, you are master builders working on the families' construction commissions for such towers. Each player competes to earn the most prestige points by completing the commissions from families and the church and by placing their seals on the work they have done. When someone plays their final seal, the other builders get one more turn before the final scoring._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Colored bricks are the currency of the game, and cards can both help and hinder your progress. On a turn, a player must choose a card from the display, taking the bricks from it and paying a brick to every card skipped. There is an opportunity to exchange three bricks for one on display before the player works in their construction site. Players can have multiple towers under construction at once. However, for every brick they wish to add on a turn, there is an extra cost, and if any towers are not built upon during a turn, then they are torn down as abandoned construction. Players must pay attention to other projects so that commissions they were counting on are not snatched away before they can claim them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game won the second prize at the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Hippodice e.V.

    <notes>ENGLISH EDITION from Pegasus Spiele.  No paste-ups needed!
Game is new in shrink.  However, there is a scuff/mar on the bottom edge of the box lid.  
Shipping will be actual cost. Probably $10-13.
I will accept Paypal, but would MUCH prefer a CoolStuffInc.com gift certificate as payment. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just going to spend it on games anyway. :)

In the Florence of the 12th-14th centuries, the city_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s powerful and influential families don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just compete with each other in trade and politics. They also try to outdo one another by building tall tower homes as status symbols. In this game, you are master builders working on the families_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; construction commissions for such towers. You build the towers from different-colored bricks you receive from the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cards. But be careful: once you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve started construction on a tower, you must keep erecting it every turn, or it will be torn down as abandoned construction. Pay attention to other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; projects, so that they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t snatch commissions you were counting on right from under your nose! Firenze is an amazing strategic game from Andreas Steding (designer of the amazing Hansa Teutonica and Norenberc) for 2-4 players with a 60 minute playtime. Amazing art-work from the incomparable Michael Menzel really draws you into the theme of the game. This highly interactive game will pit you and your friends in a race to build the tallest towers in Florence, but beware as your friends can cause harm to the towers you are constructing. </notes>

    <notes>All the game components are in excellent condition and the cards are sleeved.  There is one issue regarding the crease of the game board where the cards are housed.  There is a small imperfection at the crease.  The best way to understand this is by viewing the picture below.  Just geekmail me with your personal email if you want to see additional pictures of components.

    <notes>New in shrink, he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s retained a pristine condition. This elegant gentleman has long awaited his turn at the table while lost in the crowd of my game shelves, content all the while to draw up magnificent plans for constructing the most awe-inspiring structures ever built in the old world! Sadly for me, he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sure to remain in his cardboard prison for the foreseeable future. My current group NEVER fails to cast their votes for a heavier Euro, a COIN series or an 18XX as the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;meat and potatoes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; course of our weekend game sessions, yet he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s definitely way too heavy to play for the dessert course. I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been able to serve him up on a weeknight as just a small dinner salad! Should you ever wish to let this neat little architect out of the box to reveal his towering vision, please consider adding his talents to your own staff! $15.95 for shipping.</notes>

    <notes>The game is still in shrink wrap, but the wrap is torn in a few spots, and the bottom box is damaged (split and crinkled) in a corner.
I do not expect the game itself to be damaged, but it is still wrapped and i can not confirm this. So this is strictly and AS IS sale.
Purchased this game from a local game store in this condition and have never gotten around to opening it.</notes>

The printed paper part of the box top has some tearing or wear on two of the edges (pictured). The cardboard itself and structural integrity of the box doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to be affected. It looks like whatever they printed up to wrap and cover the box didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stick right or got pulled up a bit somehow. It might have come this way, or it might have happened from being moved.
Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from U.S.A.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>

    <notes>For those that can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wait for the reprint.
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>
