   <description>From the autumn of 1805 through the climactic summer of 1815, the entire 10 year conflict between France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Spain, is re-created in 10 separate scenarios. Each historical scenario is presented as a separate 2-player game with an average playing time of 2-3 hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Included are the following scenarios: I.

Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tacked on_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;more realism_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     3rd Edition Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.  Comprised from the 1st Edition Rulebook, Errata, 2nd Edition Rulebook, 3rd Edition Naval Rules (Official), Q_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;A, and Misc. released by Avalon Hill through the years, the 3rd Edition Rulebook is the definitive edition.  Also included are all official variants and optional rules.  Available now for download in the 'Files' section of this page.  This effort embraced the official work almost exclusively.  The 4th Edition will attempt to fix some of the issues in the official work._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     4th Edition Game Available Now_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Unofficial Mapboard, in support of the comprehensive rulebook and titled the 4th Edition Mapboard, is now available. 1st Edition Mapboard was the initial release.  Some suggestions for updates were made so that is considered the 2nd Edition (for those who used whiteout on the 4th river of Kiev).  The brand new map was the 3rd Edition.  The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.

    <notes>First edition. The rules have moderate wear but are still perfectly usable. The player aid cards and map have light wear. I am NOT guaranteeing all the counters are present - normally I check this, but for a game with this many counters worth so little, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not worth it. There is a big bag of them, is all I can say. The box has a fair amount of wear and a split corner.</notes>

Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. I’ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>I read the rules and played one scenario of this game a couple of times solitaire.
There is some very minor wear on some of the edges and corners of the box.
 The counters are all punched, but almost all of them have never been used.
I will also include color copies I had made of the rules and some of the charts. (The originals are there and fine, these are extras.)</notes>
