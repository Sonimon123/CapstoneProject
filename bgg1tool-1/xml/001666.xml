   <description>Battle Hymn is a solitaire game of combat, adventure, and heroism in the Pacific during World War II. Using the revolutionary programmed paragraph approach pioneered in the Ambush! game system, Battle Hymn gives you a squad of American Marines and challenges you to fight your way through a variety of Missions against a deceptive and ever-changing Japanese foe. Unexpected events and innumerable tactical options offer virtually endless solitaire enjoyment, and the easily learned rules start even relatively inexperienced players on their first Mission quickly. Select you squad, arm them, and choose their Mission. Move your men out, advancing them as you wish, until something triggers an Event - until a peaceful walk in the steaming jungle turns out to be a fight for your life!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>MISSING ALL COUNTERS, CARDS, and the RECORD PAD!!  That being said, everything else is here. This game would be good just for the map for the base game or you could print out the counter sheets found here on the geek to make your own counters.  Either way, this is cheap enough to be worthwhile to you.</notes>

There is only one remaining squad record sheet, but it can be copied or you can download the file from here on the Geek.  Great game, tons of fun if you are hard up for opponents.  </notes>

    <notes>Condition summary: the game would be Very Good except for rulebook, box, and player aid screen.
The game is complete.  The counters are punched, unclipped, and come in an AH-VG counter tray.  The counters are almost all very good, though the most used ones (Americans A though H) have started rubbing off.  The cards have been separated and in very good condition.  The maps look great, nice bright colors, and are in very good condition.  The player aid screen is very good except for a noticeable brown mark.  The mission cards and sleeve are also very good.  There are only 7 squad record sheets left, but included is a transparency sheet for easy updating.  The rulebook and paragraph book are very good except the previous owner used blue highlighter in the first dozen pages.  The box is structurally remarkably sound, but the artwork has started to rub off along the edges and slightly on the front and back; the corners of the front cover are showing cardboard.
Contact me and I can give you a full description of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition and/or post pictures; no surprises or risks on your end.
For every additional game you purchase, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll take $5 off, and you save on shipping.  Will ship via USPS, priority mail or media mail (if allowed) within the US.</notes>

    <notes>A very tense and exciting solitaire game. Select the weapons for your squad and then advance carefully into the jungle not knowing what you will find in each hex you enter.

    <notes>The box shows its age in shelf wear and a few dings and dents, but it is intact and relatively still sturdy.
The maps are in lovely shape.
The cards are all there. They are in okay condition considering that they were crap quality to begin with.
The counters are mostly good, but a few show heavy wear, with a bit of back side peeling on a few of them. Mostly, though, they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve held up pretty well to what looks like heavy use.
There is only one squad sheet for recording, but you can easily make copies of it. There are also nice copies to download here on the geek.
I personally examined every bit of this game. It is 100% complete.
I can take and send pictures if desired.
Shipping is $12.</notes>

My late husband was an avid board game collector/player.  He collected almost 1600 games, not all have been played.   If they were played, no food or drinks were allowed by the games during play.   He took excellent care of all his games.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

    <notes>(*INCLUDES LEATHERNECK. missing box) Both games have never been played , I punched them 30 years ago,  Battle Hymn the box is in good shape, 11 counters to Battle hymn were lost . I replaced them with home made counters. These counters include,  X1 Prone, X1 dynamite, X1 U.S MMG, X1 Japanese HMG, X1 U.S. Soldier letter K, U.S.Initiative markers X6 ; B3,C4,J1,J3,K1,K3.  Rule  and paragraph books are immaculate. The cards have not been separated, the Maps are pristine as are the cartridges and sleeves and the information screen.  I am including the Leatherneck module, with no box, where the counters are punched but complete not worn as never played, all cards unseparated. If you want to play this system, this is a great opportunity to get into it without going broke. Or If your looking for parts (* I will pay shipping in U.S.) thanks for looking</notes>
