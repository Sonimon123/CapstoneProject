    <notes>The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition is for the condition of the box, cards and expansions. This comes with the base game and the following four expansion packs: (1) Saurophaganax Expansion Deck; (2) Stomping Grounds Expansion Deck; (3) Suchomimus Expansion Deck; and (4) Therizinosaurus Expansion Deck. The cards of the base game and the expansions packs are still in shrink. The expansion packs will come inside the base box.
The shrink wrap of the base game was removed to inspect the contents of the box. Like many, the T-Rex resin mini was broken in transit from the distributor. I have since glued it.
Also note that the box is large and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit into a USPS flat rate box. This game ships from 84098.</notes>

    <notes>Please be aware, this is an incomplete set.
There are cards missing from this set, but what remains makes the game still perfectly playable as a solo game.
This was due to buying a sealed copy that was missing those cards in itself (read BGG, there were MANY problems with the KSs being sent out and the company making it is now long gone)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling due to the fact I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sourced another copy that had the whole set of cards.
All cards are sleeved, and the cards that are missing are as follows:
ALL Alpha cards for player decks (not needed for solo, photo 1)
3 Virus cards (5 remaining in box)
15 Flesh Wounds (25 remaining in box)
6 Severe Trauma (10 remaining in box)
For a solo game, you only need (Photo 2)
3 Virus
6 Severe Trauma
15 Flesh Wounds
In addition to this, the following are missing
2 Dynamic Vitality
1 Acute Alertness
1 Defensive Stance
3 Alertness
Missing these has very little impact on the game
Weight is 2.5 kilos

    <notes>Very good condition with one exception. The big start player T. Rex figure came with part of his tail snapped off. Since the company was already kaput by the time I bought the game, there was no way to get a replacement. This obviously has no effect on the game, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just a big first player marker. The cards are all in very good condition as is the box.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big, non-standard box that won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in a flat-rate shipping box. Shipping will be about 6 lbs from 94124, USPS Priority.</notes>
