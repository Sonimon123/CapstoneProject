    <notes>Asmodee Editions (ASM IL01US)
Long ago, in Troy... 
The Trojans abducted Helen, and the Achaean princes took advantage of the opportunity to lay siege on this proud city. 
But war during ancient times had its own set of rules. Being more than just a single, well-organized army, the Greeks will present an assortment of princes, each fighting for his own glory. 
Each player is an incarnation of one of these characters! 
The game proceeds in several successive sieges (phases of the game) during which victory cards are brought into play. 
With the aid of the cards in his hand, representing all the components of an ancient army (hoplites, archers, elephants, various siege engines, including the famous Trojan horse…), each player will construct a powerful army for himself, and will have to choose between sacrificing new cards from his hand (since those are not inexhaustible) or utilizing the abilities of the cards he has already placed. 
Each player will have to form the best army from these cards and will be torn between the multiple choices offered to him with each round of play. 
In this new, very tactical card game, Dominique Ehrhard brilliantly revisits the mechanisms that made Condottière so successful. 
The superb illustrations by John Mac Cambridge, antiquity fanatic, are an additional invitation to join the voyage.

    <notes>Asmodee Editions (ASM IL01US)
Long ago, in Troy... 
The Trojans abducted Helen, and the Achaean princes took advantage of the opportunity to lay siege on this proud city. 
But war during ancient times had its own set of rules. Being more than just a single, well-organized army, the Greeks will present an assortment of princes, each fighting for his own glory. 
Each player is an incarnation of one of these characters! 
The game proceeds in several successive sieges (phases of the game) during which victory cards are brought into play. 
With the aid of the cards in his hand, representing all the components of an ancient army (hoplites, archers, elephants, various siege engines, including the famous Trojan horse...), each player will construct a powerful army for himself, and will have to choose between sacrificing new cards from his hand (since those are not inexhaustible) or utilizing the abilities of the cards he has already placed. 
Each player will have to form the best army from these cards and will be torn between the multiple choices offered to him with each round of play. 
In this new, very tactical card game, Dominique Ehrhard brilliantly revisits the mechanisms that made Condottière so successful. 
The superb illustrations by John Mac Cambridge, antiquity fanatic, are an additional invitation to join the voyage. 
Contains: 
110 cards 
1 rule book

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m fairly conservative about these things, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like to say _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; unless it really is pristine. However, the game has barely been played, so you will be happy with it. Any questions, email me. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the DC area, I can hand it off to you during the work week, otherwise, you pay actual shipping -- First Class USPS.  </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee - Iliad
Language: English
Players: 2 to 6
Age: 10+
Duration: about 45 min
Weight: 0.280 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The players will lead their Greek characters into a bold action of besieging Troy and rescuing the beautiful Helene. The first one to reach 12 points will be the winner. During the game, various stages will unfold and during these, the victory cards are put into play. As it happens, a player can make his own army stronger or weaken those of his opponents by playing the correct cards. After the siege, the strongest players will receive a victory card of their choice, all cards in play will be discarded, and a new phase will unfold with the cards remaining in each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hand. Each player will then receive 3 new cards and the next battle round will commence.

    <notes>Item Name: Iliad
Description: Iliad from Asmodee mint/sealed.
Shipping Weight: 2 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>
