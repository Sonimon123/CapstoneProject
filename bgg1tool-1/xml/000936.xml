   <description>The premise of The Fury of Dracula is very similar to Scotland Yard, but with additional rules for combat, events, and encounters. One player secretly controls Dracula while the other three players are Vampire hunters cooperating to locate and defeat him._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dracula must move around the countryside, evading the hunters while leaving minions and encounters for them to uncover in his wake. If he can hide six new Vampires in Europe without the hunters destroying them, the dark prince will be declared victorious and rule the day!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Meanwhile, the hunters try to locate and destroy Dracula before he succeeds in raising an empire of undead Vampires. When they occupy the same space as a dark minion, a vampire, or even Dracula himself, then a combat system is used to determine the results._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Will the hunters be able to stem the tide of darkness, or will Europe be consumed by the Fury of Dracula?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game has been used, but the game contents are complete and in good and playable shape.  Just FYI -- This game has two cards that were misprinted by the company (it happened on one of their print-runs, I guess).  What that means is that the Wild Horses card is for Dracula but is marked as a Hunter card.  Also, the Hunter card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Jonathan Harker) says to keep, but is supposed to be _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;play immediately._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  The box is sturdy and in decent shape, but has a moderate amount of scuffing from shelfwear.  Playing pieces are plastic, not metal, as the box cover says.</notes>

    <notes>Games Workshop version.  Punched and played, but all contents complete and in good condition.  Board is clean and undamaged.  Metal miniatures unpainted.  Counters verified complete using photos on BGG.  Cards complete; this is not one of the copies with the duplicate/missing cards error.  It does, though, have the misprinted _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wild horses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; card, which was printed as a hunter card.  I wrote _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Dracula_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in ink on the backside cross to fix it.  Box is showing its age, with a lot of scuffing and compression creases, but is structurally sound.</notes>

    <notes>Components are complete and in excellent condition. Box has minor shelf wear. It was part of the print run where GW messed up the event card collating so that one sheet of cards was a duplicate. I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice until many years after GW quit making the game. So 15 of the 60 event cards have been neatly marked up with blue ink to indicate what card they should have been (see image).</notes>

    <notes>This is the limited edition with the metal miniatures. I bought this game as punched, but unplayed. I never played the game so it is still punched, but unplayed:)  The box is sturdy, but it shows shelf wear and one corner is taped. The 4 miniatures are partially painted and there is an extra fully-painted miniature that looks like a wolf man. There are solitaire rules included.</notes>
