   <description>It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. Once all players have passed, a new round begins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4026)
Designed by Carl De Visser and Jarratt Gray
It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it! 
You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you. You must strike a balance between cultural, political, industrial and financial gains, making all of the right decisions to ensure your empire’s eventual dominance. The paths you take, the battles you wage, and the choices you make will determine the ultimate shape of the new world...

    <notes>Zman Games - Endeavor
Language: English
Players: 3 to 5
Age: 12+
Duration: about 90 min
Weight: 1.770 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: A game of world exploration and empire building. You represent a European empire colonizing the Mediterranean and shipping to all parts of the world to increase the empire_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s glory and status in Industry, Culture, Finance and Politics. When a region opens up (i.e. the shipping lanes are full) a player can colonize, attack or retrieve resources from that region. The game plays easily as each turn a player builds a building giving him a special action or increasing one of his main statistics, and gets a number of people with which to activate buildings for special actions (Ship, Move, Attack, Draw or Recycle). Increased skill in Politics allow the player to hold cards that help increase his statistics and glory.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7033)
It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it! 
You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you. You must strike a balance between cultural, political, industrial and financial gains, making all of the right decisions to ensure your empire’s eventual dominance. The paths you take, the battles you wage, and the choices you make will determine the ultimate shape of the new world... </notes>

Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more.

    <notes>Brand new in shrink!  Box top is slightly dished, and there are corner creases on all four corners.
Shipping will be $12.35 to any US address. We will also combine shipping if you buy multiple items. 
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in South America, we can also ship it directly from Ecuador.  I have no idea how much that will cost, and it may take us a few days to figure out how to navigate the Ecuadorian postal system.

We only played this game once and carefully.  I am quite sure Z-man shorted the game.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t recall the game being affected by this short.  The game is complete otherwise.
I will ship worldwide for actual shipping costs at the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense.
NOTE: I can deliver at BGG.con 2013 on November 22nd</notes>

    <notes>I bought this a while ago, not realising someone in my games club already had it. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn`t get to play it anywhere else, so it`s surplus to my requirements.
 I believe the previous owner only played it once, and I haven`t played it at all, so it`s in excellent condition.</notes>

Game is complete and comes from a pet free, smoke free home. 
I can ship to the US and Canada. Shipping will be the exact cost from whatever courrier you prefer. Shipping originates from Montreal, Quebec, Canada (H2A2M7) if you want to lookup shipping rates to your destination.
For shipping outside of US and Canada, please note that shipping is expensive and I will not ship without a tracking number unless you pay by money order. 
Enjoy!</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only recently started to utilize all the site has to offer, thus this is my first Geek Market posting.  I do have an established seller rating on ebay that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be happy to share to serious buyers upon request.
I wish I could list this as Like New, but the instruction booklet is a little worn and missing the bottom staple.  Otherwise it has no blemishes.  Further, the backs of a few of the player boards have some smudges that is typical as this copy has seen several plays.  
Aside from that though, all pieces and components are there.  The player boards, box, cards, and game board are in pristine condition as you would expect in an Like New listing.
I will be adding packing to the inside as well as out of the game box for shipping so the components don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bounce around until it gets to your shelf.    The game has no insert and never did as far as I know.  Shipping will be exactly what it costs to get the game to you!</notes>

    <notes>This is the French version but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pretty much language independent apart from the rules, an English set of which can be found here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/46651/endeavor-rules-english-pdf (the building tiles have the name of the building as well as its illustration - the name is unimportant but is usually clear anyway, eg Banque=Bank, Forteresse=Fortress). Plus I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve written up a rules summary in English which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included.
The game is in excellent condition having been played twice.
P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P is £3 to the UK only.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game is no longer in shrinkwrap.  However, the game is unpunched and unplayed.
All components are present (map, player boards, cards, counters, wooden pieces and rulebook).  The one deck of cards have been opened to ensure all 48 cards are present (and they are).
The game box is in very good condition after all of these years.  The box top is beginning to bowl in a bit (probably due to heavier games on top).
Game comes from non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the English Edition of Endeavor (Not the 2018 KS Endeavor: Age of Sail, but the game that inspired it and is almost entirely the same).  
This game is complete and in good condition, with shelfwear on the box being somewhat present as the only indicator this game is used.  It was played 3-4 times.
The ONLY reason I am getting rid of this is that the KS took its place since it is essentially the same game.   For those of you looking to get the full experience but not drop $100 on the KS version, this is where to go!
Flat rate shipping of $13.60 via USPS.</notes>
