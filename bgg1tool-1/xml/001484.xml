   <description>This is a semi-cooperative game which puts the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;thief_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; against the rest of the players, who take the role of detectives.  As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1991 Mensa Select_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Also selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Original name by inventors was Heist.

    <notes>This 1991 hard-to-find, 3-dimentional game by Parker Brothers is one we enjoyed .
The thief who steals the most paintings wins while the game characters and cameras try to catch the thief.
Contents are complete, clean _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; undamaged.  The box is solid but does have dings _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; dents, a small amount of remaining tape and shelf wear. </notes>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Parker Brothers, 1991 - Clue, The Museum Caper - COMPLETE.  Outer Box is in good condition with (1) taped corner and minor shelf wear (numerous age spots).  There is a small puncture just above _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;miss white_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; head (about .75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in diameter) and a small bit of price tag residue on bottom side of lid (about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length).(see picture_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s for more detail).  Interior contents are in very good condition with only minimal signs of use.  Of note: on the game board (1) of the museum outdoor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;signs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; has a torn decal - does not affect gameplay in any way, but needs mentioned.  Bottom box likewise has numerous _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;age spots_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and a couple of creases in the corners (longest being about 6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) not uncommon with boxes of this size.  See actual item photos below for further detail.  This game will weigh around 4.25 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping.  I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address.  Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above.   
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above.  Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway.  I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility.  All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be.  For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal.  I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation).  
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation).  Insurance is optional but recommended.  If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority).  I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay.  Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site.  You can look up my user id:  junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks.  I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG.  
Thanks,
Jon</notes>

3-D gameboard
6 video camera markers

One thief plotting pad
One thief pawn (gray)
6 clue character pawns (white, purple, yellow, green, blue, red)

Box is intact, no split corners, but does have scratches, small dings and slight dishing (concavity on box lid). Also clear tape remnants and a small (one inch) spot on the lid above Colonel Mustard’s head that looks as if something wet was spilled and allowed to dry. This does not affect the game or the pieces.

    <notes>Purchase by Auction reserved for Barlekamp.
Clue: The great Museum Caper, by Parker Bros., 1991.
Contents have received light play.  The components are clean _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; undamaged, and the pad is nearly complete.  The Thief Shield is missing--that is the stand up cardboard shield behind which the thief hides his moves.  (We used the box top.)
The box is a mess.  A corner split top _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; bottom, and repaired with tape.  Tape residue from years ago. Dings and dished, stained _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; faded with significant shelf wear.

Parker Brothers
1991
Includes two copies of the rules in Spanish, but none in English; 3-D game board; 9 paintings; Thief shield; plotting pad; 6 of the 7 pawns (missing orange); 6 video cameras; 11 window locks; 2 dice; cardboard box insert.  Components are in good condition.
Box has significant wear, including creases, tape on the box bottom, price tag residue, and general shelf wear.  No split corners.
This is a large game.  If you want it shipped anywhere far from Seattle, shipping will be fairly high.

    <notes>All components including the game board and playing pieces are complete and in good condition. Comes with two sets of rules - English and Spanish. The rules and Thief shield have a few wrinkles and general wear. The Thief plotting pad has approximately 1/3 of the sheets remaining. The box is in good condition and has some general shelf wear, dishing, and a split corner. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly - within 24 hours of receiving payment. I have many hundreds of games for sale and would be happy to combine shipping charges for multiple games to save you money. Shipping weight is 8 pounds.</notes>
