   <description>Among the Stars takes place in a war-ravaged galaxy where the warring alien races have declared peace in the wake of a threat with the potential to destroy them all. An Alliance is established to build space stations throughout the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations, and defend against this impending threat. Each player takes the role of one of those races trying to build the greatest space station. Through card drafting, the players select locations, and use these to build their station, scoring victory points based on the placement. The construction lasts four years, and the alien race with the most points at the end wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SHG8013)
Among the Stars takes place in a war-ravaged galaxy where the warring alien races have declared peace in the wake of a threat with the potential to destroy them all. An Alliance is established to build space stations throughout the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations, and defend against this impending threat. Each player takes the role of one of those races trying to build the greatest space station. Through card drafting, the players select locations, and use these to build their station, scoring victory points based on the placement. The construction lasts four years, and alien race with the most points at the end wins.</notes>

    <notes>English Edition - Artipia Games
Excellent condition - no box insert - official _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Among The Stars_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tuck boxes used instead. One of the main reactor cards is very mildly bent (hardly noticeable and certainly has no effect on game-play but always worth mentioning these things upfront!). 
NB: The contents list on the rulebook is wrong - there are more energy cubes than listed and slightly fewer money tokens than listed - neither affects gameplay at all!
Bundle of Among the Stars expansions including…
The Ambassadors - as new condition (cards still in shrink although box is not) - English. Artipia Games.
Plus:
Among The Stars: The Promos (also known as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Expanding the Alliance_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) as new condition (cards still in shrink although box is not) - English. Artipia Games.
Kickstarter 2014 Stretch Rewards and additional Kickstarter items: 
2 new races: Feronzy and Monzeerian
1 pack of 70 cards
Plastic ships and plastic year marker plus new scoring board.
8 additional energy cubes
Postage: £6 via My Hermes Courier (UK only)
NOTE:   I WILL ONLY SHIP TO THE UK AND WILL USE MYHERMES COURIER. I WILL NOT SHIP TO THE REST OF EUROPE OR THE REST OF THE WORLD.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Punched but unplayed. Cards sleeved. Contents look freshly opened. Box appears like new.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>This is the stronghold edition. It for certain has ambassadors, expanding the alliance, and a broken token insert (assembled).
There might even be more in this box- I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not familiar enough with all the promos and such- it has a lot of cards here and most are in shrink.
Box and components are in very good condition.

    <notes>Base game, The Ambassadors, Indiegogo Promos, Hythian, Ambassadorial Shuttle, Wiss, Pre-order Promo Cards, and Section Seal. Also includes Kickstarter miniature ships AND a Broken Token insert. This is well over $100 of value in one package.
 
Also includes these metal tokens: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2766907/kirkbauer.
Everything is included in the base game box, no other boxes are included. Sadly enough this has never been played, most of the expansion cards are still in shrink-wrap.

    <notes>This listing is for the Artipia edition of Among the Stars.  Also included are the two expansions, The Ambassadors and Expanding the Alliance.  The base game has been played a couple of times.  The expansions have never been used but the cards have been added to the main game box so there are no expansion boxes.  The base game has been sleeved, which I will include.  The base game box also has The Broken Token_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s insert for the game, one of the race expansions available at the BGG store, and a pack of promos from the kickstarter.
I will ship via USPS Priority Mail so shipping is $13</notes>

Reserved for johnweldy for pickup at Gen Con
Please submit payment via PayPal, Google Wallet or Venmo to gramaw@gmail.com.  Alternatively, you may pay, via one of these methods or COD, directly at the convention.  
Since I am selling so many games I plan to meet as many buyers as possible on Saturday morning at 9AM outside of hall A on level 1 of the convention center, near room 128 (this was the former location of multiple Gen Con Math trade meetups, in case you are familiar.)  You can find a link to a map of the denoted area here:    https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4236187/gramaw
If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>
