   <description>Dixit: Journey features the same basic game play as Dixit: Each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from their hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty or otherwise doing something that in their opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in their own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then they receive no points; if they received some votes but not all the votes, they score based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on their card submission also scores. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dixit: Journey differs from Dixit in a number of ways, starting with a simplified scoring board that doesn't have players moving around a track in the bottom of the game box. Instead the scoring track is on its own board, and this game board includes a summary of the rules as well as numbered places to put the cards each round to facilitate voting. The game rules  have been revised to make the game easier to learn, while keeping game play the same._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Similar to:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Dixit 3: Journey _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; In Europe, the cards from Dixit: Journey will be packaged as an expansion and not sold as a complete game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The game was not played and it is partially unpunched...the squares that are unpunched had already fallen out when we opened the game to look at it. The box has some wear from being moved around and on the bottom box, there is a slight indentation from when one of us picked the box up from the corner instead of squarely underneath (see pics). The only other issue with the game that bears mentioning is that several of the cards have wear on their corners (see pic)...they also came this way and would not affect game play. The game was checked and inventoried to be sure...it is complete and ready to play.  Assume USPS PArcel Select shipping at 3.5 lbs.</notes>

    <notes>Contains BOTH cards from this version of Dixit plus cards from the base game.  Graded _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a total of 165 (plus one duplicated for a total of 166) cards when there should be a minimum of 168 cards.  So there are at least three missing cards.  However, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re still getting almost double the number of cards you normally get in Dixit Journey.  Otherwise the game is good to VG.  Box is solid, no split corners.  Voting chips and most cards are VG or better.  
Shipping within 500 miles of NH is less than $10.  Max shipping nationwide is $13.</notes>
