   <description>Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Wu-Feng _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodee Editions (ASM GH0MU01)
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Wu-Feng, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found where the funeral urn containing his ashes is kept. His hordes are already marching upon the small village of the Middle Kingdom hiding them_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Players are taoist priests, who will have to defend the village from the army of shadows preparing to invade it. Each of them has different special powers which will help them in this mission. 
The village is represented by nine tiles, each of which illustrates a different area. Around that are placed the tiles for each player, where the ghosts will appear on their starting locations. 
The players, as a group, will have to exorcise the specters which will appear as the game goes on, often faster than expected... As at the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot. And more than one can come in at the same time. There are many types of specters which will need to be sent back to hell more or less quickly, as some can haunt the village and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;destroy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tiles. If there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s too many of them at a given time, the players risk losing some of their life points (Ki points). 
On his turn, a priest can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the power of the villager living on the tile. 
To exorcise, he must roll three dice (the Tao dice) and end up with enough face up colors of the ghosts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; color. Thankfully, one of the dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s face is a wild color which can be used as any color. To exorcise a black ghost of power 2, you need to roll three black or white (the bonus color). The players also benefit from Tao tokens which can pad out the dice roll. They gain these by entering certain village tiles, by exorcising certain ghosts or thanks to their special powers. When they are on the same tile, a priest can give Tao tokens to another priest in order to help with his exorcism. 
Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. The cemetary allows, for example, to bring a dead priest back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts. 
The priests have three or four Ki points (depending on the difficulty level of the game). They also get a Yin-Yang token they can spend in order to make two actions in a single turn. Exorcising certain powerful ghosts allows to recover a spent Yin-Yang or Tao tokens. The special powers available to the players allow to recover Tao tokens, move more than one square or move another player, to benefit from an extra Tao die, etc. They strengthen the required collaboration by giving each priest a specialty. 
To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game, once the players have been worn out by the hordes of ghosts breaking in since the beginning of the game. And if you decide to play on a harder difficulty mode, there will be many incarnations, each more dangerous than the last. 
The ways to lose are, of course, even more numerous. The players lose if three of the village_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiles are destroyed, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of 
Wu-Feng is still in play, or, simply, that all the priests are dead...

    <notes>This game annoys me and I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even played it. Love the theme, artwork, so I opened it, read the rules, set it up and thought it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me.  My family just won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get it. So now it can be for you.  All pieces, boards, cards accounted for.  Non smoking home.   Make it go away.
  Hate the high shipping costs, but will go with $11 for continental USA, priority mail.  If it is cheaper, I will refund difference.  Local pickup fine too.

    <notes>Asmodée (ASM GHOMU01)
Wu-Feng, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found where the funeral urn containing his ashes is kept. 
His hordes are already marching upon the small village of the Middle Kingdom hiding them_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Players are taoist priests, who will have to defend the village from the army of shadows preparing to invade it. Each of them has different special powers which will help them in this mission. 
The village is represented by nine tiles, each of which illustrates a different area. Around that are placed the tiles for each player, where the ghosts will appear on their starting locations. 
The players, as a group, will have to exorcise the specters which will appear as the game goes on, often faster than expected... As at the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot. And more than one can come in at the same time. There are many types of specters which will need to be sent back to hell more or less quickly, as some can haunt the village and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;destroy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tiles. If there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s too many of them at a given time, the players risk losing some of their life points (Ki points). 
On his turn, a priest can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the power of the villager living on the tile. 
To exorcise, he must roll three dice (the Tao dice) and end up with enough face up colors of the ghosts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; color. Thankfully, one of the dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s face is a wild color which can be used as any color. To exorcise a black ghost of power 2, you need to roll three black or white (the bonus color). The players also benefit from Tao tokens which can pad out the dice roll. They gain these by entering certain village tiles, by exorcising certain ghosts or thanks to their special powers. When they are on the same tile, a priest can give Tao tokens to another priest in order to help with his exorcism. 
Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. The cemetary allows, for example, to bring a dead priest back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts. 
The priests have three or four Ki points (depending on the difficulty level of the game). They also get a Yin-Yang token they can spend in order to make two actions in a single turn. Exorcising certain powerful ghosts allows to recover a spent Yin-Yang or Tao tokens. The special powers available to the players allow to recover Tao tokens, move more than one square or move another player, to benefit from an extra Tao die, etc. They strengthen the required collaboration by giving each priest a specialty. 
To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game, once the players have been worn out by the hordes of ghosts breaking in since the beginning of the game. And if you decide to play on a harder difficulty mode, there will be many incarnations, each more dangerous than the last. 
The ways to lose are, of course, even more numerous. The players lose if three of the village_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiles are destroyed, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of 
Wu-Feng is still in play, or, simply, that all the priests are dead. </notes>

Thankfully, one of the dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s face is a wild color which can be used as any color. To exorcise a black ghost of power 2, you need to roll three black or white (the bonus color). The players also benefit from Tao tokens which can pad out the dice roll. They gain these by entering certain village tiles, by exorcising certain ghosts or thanks to their special powers. When they are on the same tile, a priest can give Tao tokens to another priest in order to help with his exorcism. 
Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. The cemetary allows, for example, to bring a dead priest back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts. 
The priests have three or four Ki points (depending on the difficulty level of the game). They also get a Yin-Yang token they can spend in order to make two actions in a single turn. Exorcising certain powerful ghosts allows to recover a spent Yin-Yang or Tao tokens. The special powers available to the players allow to recover Tao tokens, move more than one square or move another player, to benefit from an extra Tao die, etc. They strengthen the required collaboration by giving each priest a specialty. 
To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game, once the players have been worn out by the hordes of ghosts breaking in since the beginning of the game. And if you decide to play on a harder difficulty mode, there will be many incarnations, each more dangerous than the last. 
The ways to lose are, of course, even more numerous. The players lose if three of the village_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiles are destroyed, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or, simply, that all the priests are dead. </notes>

    <notes>Asmodée (ASM GHOMU01)
Wu-Feng, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found where the funeral urn containing his ashes is kept. 
His hordes are already marching upon the small village of the Middle Kingdom hiding them_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Players are taoist priests, who will have to defend the village from the army of shadows preparing to invade it. Each of them has different special powers which will help them in this mission. 
The village is represented by nine tiles, each of which illustrates a different area. Around that are placed the tiles for each player, where the ghosts will appear on their starting locations. 
The players, as a group, will have to exorcise the specters which will appear as the game goes on, often faster than expected... As at the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot. And more than one can come in at the same time. There are many types of specters which will need to be sent back to hell more or less quickly, as some can haunt the village and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;destroy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tiles. If there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s too many of them at a given time, the players risk losing some of their life points (Ki points). 
On his turn, a priest can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the power of the villager living on the tile. 
To exorcise, he must roll three dice (the Tao dice) and end up with enough face up colors of the ghosts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; color. Thankfully, one of the dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s face is a wild color which can be used as any color. To exorcise a black ghost of power 2, you need to roll three black or white (the bonus color).

    <notes>Item Name: Ghost Stories
Description: Used, complete, and in great shape.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASM GHOMU01)
The Lord of Nine Hells walks the earth.
Wu-Feng, the Lord of Nine Hells, has discovered the village hiding the funeral urn containing his ashes. Four Taoist priests protect the village, as hordes of ghosts and demons descend on the town to reclaim the remains of their evil overlord. Can you hold out against the forces of eternal darkness, or will Wu-Feng recover his ashes and destroy everything in his path?
In Ghost Stories, the players work together as the Taoist priests attempting to turn back the tide of evil and save the doomed village. With mystical powers and ancient martial arts, the heroes will battle wave after wave of ghosts and demons until Wu-Feng himself rises to claim his remains. Working together is your only hope, as the ghosts increase in number and force the Taoist priests to sacrifice resources, time and even their very lives in this desperate battle against the hordes of Hell.
Ghost Stories is a cooperative game for one to four players. With modular playing tiles and a randomized deck of ghastly foes, no two games will be alike. The cards and tiles boast fantastic illustrations inspired by kung-fu legends, and a variety of excellent plastic playing pieces will draw you into the game. Gather your forces and battle the Lord of Nine Hells in the ultimate battle of good versus evil!

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMGHOMU01)
The Lord of Nine Hells walks the earth. Wu-Feng, the Lord of Nine Hells, has discovered the village hiding the funeral urn containing his ashes. Four Taoist priests protect the village, as hordes of ghosts and demons descend on the town to reclaim the remains of their evil overlord. Can you hold out against the forces of eternal darkness, or will Wu-Feng recover his ashes and destroy everything in his path? In Ghost Stories, the players work together as the Taoist priests attempting to turn back the tide of evil and save the doomed village. With mystical powers and ancient martial arts, the heroes will battle wave after wave of ghosts and demons until Wu-Feng himself rises to claim his remains. Working together is your only hope, as the ghosts increase in number and force the Taoist priests to sacrifice resources, time and even their very lives in this desperate battle against the hordes of Hell. Ghost Stories is a cooperative game for one to four players. With modular playing tiles and a randomized deck of ghastly foes, no two games will be alike. The cards and tiles boast fantastic illustrations inspired by kung-fu legends, and a variety of excellent plastic playing pieces will draw you into the game. Gather your forces and battle the Lord of Nine Hells in the ultimate battle of good versus evil! </notes>

    <notes>Received this game in a trade. It is in good to acceptable condition as defined here.  The box has nicked corners and a definitely used feel, but nothing terrible.  There are no missing items.  The rules book is slightly worn, but not bent or anything.  I sleeved the cards into premium thickness sleeves and made a make shift cardboard box to put them in.  All playing components are in perfectly fine condition.
Shipping will be based on actual shipping costs, likelihood around $10.  Check my other sales to see if you would like multiple items to save on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>So, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a bit on the anal side and I had my pieces for this game professionally painted.  Unfortunately, when I moved recently, the movers didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do a good job on this particular game and one corner of the box lid was ripped and I had to tape it back with clear packing tape.  I just can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stand having great painted minis and a sad box.  So I bought a second copy of the game and I am selling a brand new game (unpunched, cards unwrapped) in an older and damaged box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games (unlike my movers). Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>VGC all pieces present.
Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell – Wu-Feng – and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMGHOMU01)
The Lord of Nine Hells walks the earth. Wu-Feng, the Lord of Nine Hells, has discovered the village hiding the funeral urn containing his ashes. Four Taoist priests protect the village, as hordes of ghosts and demons descend on the town to reclaim the remains of their evil overlord. Can you hold out against the forces of eternal darkness, or will Wu-Feng recover his ashes and destroy everything in his path? In Ghost Stories, the players work together as the Taoist priests attempting to turn back the tide of evil and save the doomed village. With mystical powers and ancient martial arts, the heroes will battle wave after wave of ghosts and demons until Wu-Feng himself rises to claim his remains. Working together is your only hope, as the ghosts increase in number and force the Taoist priests to sacrifice resources, time and even their very lives in this desperate battle against the hordes of Hell. Ghost Stories is a cooperative game for one to four players. With modular playing tiles and a randomized deck of ghastly foes, no two games will be alike. The cards and tiles boast fantastic illustrations inspired by kung-fu legends, and a variety of excellent plastic playing pieces will draw you into the game. Gather your forces and battle the Lord of Nine Hells in the ultimate battle of good versus evil! </notes>

    <notes>For sale 1 x Ghost Stories. It has been played a few times and is being sold because I need room and this is a game I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t very much enjoy playing. It deserves a new home.
The game is very good condition, with some slight wear at the corners.
Shipping UK £2.50
I have added pictures of the box (front, back and corners) and components. There are also two laminated player guides.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMGHOMU01)
The Lord of Nine Hells walks the earth. Wu-Feng, the Lord of Nine Hells, has discovered the village hiding the funeral urn containing his ashes. Four Taoist priests protect the village, as hordes of ghosts and demons descend on the town to reclaim the remains of their evil overlord. Can you hold out against the forces of eternal darkness, or will Wu-Feng recover his ashes and destroy everything in his path? In Ghost Stories, the players work together as the Taoist priests attempting to turn back the tide of evil and save the doomed village. With mystical powers and ancient martial arts, the heroes will battle wave after wave of ghosts and demons until Wu-Feng himself rises to claim his remains. Working together is your only hope, as the ghosts increase in number and force the Taoist priests to sacrifice resources, time and even their very lives in this desperate battle against the hordes of Hell. Ghost Stories is a cooperative game for one to four players. With modular playing tiles and a randomized deck of ghastly foes, no two games will be alike. The cards and tiles boast fantastic illustrations inspired by kung-fu legends, and a variety of excellent plastic playing pieces will draw you into the game. Gather your forces and battle the Lord of Nine Hells in the ultimate battle of good versus evil!</notes>

I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags. I will work with you to ship the most cost efficient way or however you prefer. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. If the item is a small card game the shipping will be USPS First Class and will be under $5 total with shipping materials. Local pickup with no shipping available if you live in the Seattle area.

    <notes>Box has a couple of scuffs on the corners.
There is one black haunting figure missing (7 not 9) although i may come across it before sale.
Having played the game countless times i have never seen more than 5/6 haunting figures on the board at the same time. Any more and you would be dead. So effectivly the missing peice was nothing more than a spare anyway.

Bezahlung per Überweisung.
PayPal +2€
Privatverkauf, kein Umtausch. 
Versand DHL versichert (auch Packstation).

    <notes>Components are like new. The box has a bit wear and tear. Game comes without box insert (because the insert does not fit if you include the expansion in the box). 
If you wish, I can include the white moon expansion (without the separate box) for an additional 20 EUR.
I am not sure about the year of the edition (it does not say on the box), but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s one of the the multilingual editions (English, German, and French). Components are language independent.</notes>

    <notes>The game is no longer in shrinkwrap, but it is unplayed.
The two tilesheets (locations, markers, etc) are still in the shrinkwrap (torn open at one end) and unpunched.  The dice are all present as well plastic figures and player boards.
The original deck of cards was opened to make sure all cards were present.  There is a second deck of cards (not opened) that is a bit smaller than the original deck.  This is the replacement deck that was sent by Repos.
The insert is still present and in decent shape, but not quite straight after all of this time.
All rules and player aids are present.
The game box appears to be very good shape after all of these years.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.
I also have one copy of the Spielbox magazine with the Ghost Stories: The Guardhouse Expansion for sale.  Additionally, I can also add many of the Ghost Stories promos to a sale (including the somewhat rare Jean-Claude Van Rice promo) as well as an Infernal Die (once I find what I did with it!).</notes>

    <notes>This is the complete Antoine Bauza GHOST STORIES trilogy for hours of cooperative replayability. Can accommodate 1-4 players, with a fifth player possibility in the BLACK SECRET expansion, taking on the role of the infamous Wu-Feng.
Game is lightly used, and all components are all stored in original GHOST STORIES box with instructions for all parts of game (see pictures to view the beautiful parts of this game). Bits and boards are all contained in the box with a Plano storage box (I added) to keep track of all components. In addition to the 9 village tiles in the base set, and the additional village tiles for WHITE MOON and BLACK SECRET expansions, this set also includes the GUARDHOUSE expansion, which adds an extra 12th tile and five additional ghost cards which pay homage to the creators of the game. This set also includes a surprise promo card given out with Essen 2011 version of BLACK SECRET featuring Steven Qi-Gal (which is only playable when using the WHITE MOON expansion).
This complete set can be scaled down or ramped up to fit the gaming preference of your group, and, best of all: it is all contained in one box for easy access and storage. Why buy all three and extra bonuses when you can have it all in one set.
Will ship using USPS Priority mail at flat rate cost of $17.30</notes>

    <notes>INCLUDING THE WHITE MOON EXPANSION! (White Moon expansion box -not- included! I put all the cards and components in the base game box.)
Both: English, Dutch, French edition.
Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This unique game - Ghost Stories +! Ghost Stories: White moon (expansion) - has been played a few times (the expansion only once, I think). Box looks like new though, game components are very good+, so I graded the game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; overall. I do take good care of my games :) ...
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL, DHL, DPD). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/gideongrim ...</notes>
