   <description>Darkest Night, by designer Jeremy Lennert, is a fully-cooperative board game for one to four players (up to six with variants), set in a kingdom broken under a necromancer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s shadow.  Each player takes on the role of one of the kingdom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s last heroes (nine playable characters), each with a unique set of special abilities, just as they hatch a plan to save the realm._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Searching the kingdom provides new powers and equipment to strengthen you and your party, as well as the keys that can unlock the holy relics and defeat the necromancer. You can acquire many powerful abilities_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;unique to each hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;that can help to fight the undead, elude the necromancer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s forces, accelerate your searches for items and artifacts, and more. The knight is a brave and powerful warrior; the prince can rally and inspire the people; the scholar excels at locating and restoring the treasures of the past._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;But ravenous undead roam the realm, and as the necromancer continues to build his power base, he blights the land and his army steadily grows. As the game wears on, the necromancer becomes more and more powerful, creating blights more quickly and effectively. If an area becomes too blighted, it gets overrun_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;and the monastery receives the spillover. And if the monastery is ever overrun, the necromancer wins and the kingdom is swallowed in darkness!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Before the monastery falls, it's up to you and your party to defeat the necromancer in one of two ways: If you can gather three holy relics and bring them all back to the monastery, you can perform a powerful ritual to break the necromancer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s power and scour the land of the undead. Alternatively, you can try to defeat the necromancer in direct combat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;but be warned, he will readily sacrifice his minions to save himself._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Can you save the kingdom from darkness? Do you have the courage, the cunning and the will to withstand the necromancer and his forces? Strategize, plan and bring out the best of your abilities to end our Darkest Night!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Data:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scale_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scale: Each unit represents a Hero, the Necromancer or blights in a guerilla war over a small kingdom. Each round represents approximately several days to a week._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Victory Point Games Boxed edition with both the paper and mounted boards.
The components are in very good condition.  The box slipcase has a little bit of shelf wear on bottom edge.
The reason this is acceptable (vice very good) is that it only includes 7 of the 16 key counters.  I did not find this to be much of an issue because you normally only collect 3 keys before trading them in for a holy relic.  So it is only an issue if you have 4 characters and they are all holding a couple keys each (or you can use a substitute or the publisher will sell extra counters if you contact them).  Your party would have to be extremely dumb to be walking around with 16 key counters.
I can ship this regular priority, flat rate priority, or standard mail, whichever you prefer.  At most, shipping will be the cost of a medium flat rate priority mail box.  </notes>

    <notes>Darkest Night Bundle
This includes [b][thing=128445][/thing] + [thing=145056]With an Inner Light[/thing] + [thing=149257]On Shifting Winds[/thing] + [thing=140666]Nymph Promo[/thing] + [thing=171957]Enchanter Promo[/thing][/b]
This is equivalent to the [thing=153703]Necromancer Bundle[/thing].  I even have the collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box to store it all*.  It has everything in the Necromancer Bundle as well as the Enchanter promo character.  The game is in like new condition.  I set up the game and played a few rounds, then put it all back in the box.  Everything is sorted and bagged.  It comes from a smoke-free home.
Buyer will pay for shipping, but we can work out the cheapest method.
*The [url=http://www.victorypointgames.com/darkest-night-necro-box.html]collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s box[/url] is the same size as the box for the Necromancer Bundle but it has different artwork - I do not have the poster and I did not buy the dice tower.</notes>

    <notes>With the bonuses shown below, this represents EXCELLENT value for money. I have for The Darkest Night INCLUDING the first three expansions included _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;With An Inner Light_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;From The Abyss_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;On Shifting Winds_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
The whole kit is in the one box and all cards in one deck. But all 3 extra boxes are there so if you wish to seperate, you can do so. Game is punched, but has been _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;soot_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; cleaned over the laser counters. Played once. 
I take Paypal but do prefer online bank transfer from account to account to save on the heavy fees. Postage is extra but will be at cost, nothing added.</notes>

    <notes>Description: Darkest Night from Victory Point Games
Shipping Weight:  3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>
