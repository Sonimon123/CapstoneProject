   <description>OGRE and its sequel G.E.V., are tactical ground combat games set in the not-so-distant future. In 2085 A.D., armored warfare continues - faster and deadlier than ever. Hovercraft, tanks and infantry slug it out with tactical nuclear devices. But the most feared weapon of all needs no human guidance. It's a giant cybernetic tank called the OGRE._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The basic OGRE game gives one player a force of infantry and armor, and a command post he must defend. The other player has only one unit - but it's an OGRE. It's an even match. Advanced games allow solitaire or multi-player action, with OGREs on both sides._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Microgame #1 in the Metagaming Microgames series, and the original release of Ogre.

    <notes>This is not the first (and awfully produced) version of Ogre, but the much more durable and attractive [b]OGRE: DELUXE[/b] version.  Printed in 1987, this version was the first to include a [b]hard board-mounted map[[/b] (rather than the cheap flimsy folded paper map of the original) and [b]stand-up[/b] counters.
Image of the cover can be found here: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/17788/ogre
Condition is Good.  Box has seen some wear, and one side is sun-faded.  But the board and playing pieces are complete, and in lovely shape.
I will ship USPS Priority Mail, and include Delivery Confirmation, so you can enjoy total peace of mind that this collectible and sought-after game will arrive safely at your doorstep.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete set of the miniatures from both the Deluxe Ogre and Deluxe GEV sets. This would be an excellent start on an OGRE minis collection and includes many minis that are no longer available from SJG.
There are (mostly) no maps, rules, or other materials included. The only other parts I have are 1 of the 6 (?) VHS-style cases originally included as well as the original slipcases for both games - those are yours if you want them, but may require a bigger shipping box.
The minis included are:
Deluxe OGRE
Ogre Mk. III
(Combine Forces)
Command Post
6 GEV_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s
4 Hvy Tanks
4 Msl Tanks
1 Howitzer
21 Infantry
10 Bases
Deluxe GEV
(Paneuro Forces)
Command Post
6 GEV
6 Lt GEV
1 Super Hvy Tank
4 Hvy Tanks
4 Msl Tanks
4 Lt Tanks
1 Howitzer
1 Mobile Howitzer
18 Infantry
8 Bases
Retail on these would be approximately $130 from Warehouse 23, but a large portion of them have been out-of-print for quite some time.
Shipping should be around $6-11, depending on whether you want the slipcases and VHS case or just the minis.</notes>

    <notes>KICKSTARTER VERSION, with all the goodies, like the canvas bag, a T-shirt (L), Pocket Ogre, extra tile sheets, etc. Plus, I bought an extra set of 4 dice (so 6 total, 3 red and 3 blue) and extra KS sheets. 
I purchased extra copies of:
- KS Exclusive Overlays (2 sheets) (Actually, they have have given us two copies of these. One way or the other, I have two copies of these two sheets.)
- Targets Go Boom (2 sheets)
- Vulcan _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Friends (2 sheets)
I also purchased from the Geek Store:
- BGG 3-D Units (1 sheet)
- BGG Exclusive Overlays (2 sheets)
PLUS, all the stuff the KS came with. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure exactly what was exclusive versus what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the retail box, but I know there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a lot!
The game has been opened but is unpunched and unplayed. It will ship in the same shipping carton in which it shipped to me. (Actually, it came in two boxes and it may have to come to you in two as well.)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing it for the price I paid… I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just trying to recoup my cost. Even though the buyer will have to pay shipping for a notoriously heavy game, this is still a great deal for someone that missed the KS campaign.</notes>

    <notes>Ogre Pocket Edn - third edition 1978 
AND
GEV Pocket Edition 1978
Both the Ogre and GEV maps have been laminated onto thick card backing. The Ogre map is on a single piece of card, the GEV map is on two pieces. 
There is also an additional two-board map that appears to have been hand coloured. Possibly an internet download? fan scenario? hand made? I bought this second-hand so I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say.
Shipping from the UK. Happy to ship anywhere. 
P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P will be charged at cost. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested please get in touch with your location and I can give you options and estimates.
Personal cheques can only be accepted from UK members. Overseas buyers Paypal only please.
Any questions - please get in touch.
cheers

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter edition of the game and (in addition to the Ogre Designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition game) includes the three Kickstarter exclusive counter sheets, the two BGG counter sheets and a copy of Pocket Ogre.
The game is unplayed but has been punched and sorted into the box inserts.  The bottom corners and edge of the box are slightly damaged from shipping--please see the accompanying pictures.
Buyer pays actual shipping cost (including cost of shipping materials, insurance, signature confirmation and tracking).  Please keep in mind that Ogre is a large and heavy game, so shipping may be a significant amount.</notes>

    <notes>Steve Jackson Games (SJG1112)
Ogre was Steve Jackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s first game. Originally published in 1977, it became a hit as the first _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Microgame,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and is now considered a classic. Over 25 years after its release, it earned a spot in James Lowder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s popular book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. In 2013, Steve Jackson Games released the Designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition of Ogre... a 28 pound box with giant maps and nearly a thousand counters, retailing for $100. Now Pocket Ogre takes the game back to its roots: a small rulebook, 140 counters, and the same bare-bones map Steve drew himself for the very first printing. And the price is the same as it has always been: $2.95. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t meant as a collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s item, though. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a tense, very playable game that can fit in your pocket, and come out any time you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got a spare half-hour. It was a good idea in 1977, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a good idea now!</notes>

    <notes>Game is missing the rules. Otherwise complete. Box in decent shape, no tears or splits, but does show some modest wear. All pieces and stands are there. This is the 1987 Ogre Deluxe edition. Came with a nice mounted, larger board and cardboard playing pieces that went in small plastic stands. The stands and playing pieces are all there. Very nice upgrade from the simple little game that Orge originally came out as. (Picture is one I pulled from BGG, just to show what board and playing pieces look like.)
Shipping will be $11.00  US only please</notes>

Mint, new, unopened copy of the Designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition monster in its original shipping box. Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
Shipping to be determined by location...write me and let me know your zip code for a quote . As an example, to NYC or Chicago it would be about $20. We are located in NC, so anything in the eastern half of the US will be pretty reasonable, but it will be expensive to California. I am willing to ship worldwide, but be prepared for extreme costs overseas.

    <notes>Ogre Designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition - Kickstarter Version 
Also comes with:
Ogre Pocket Edition 
Ogre Sponsor Counter Sheets (these are all of them):
ACD Distribution Sponsored Sheet - Sheet R1
Barbarians at the Gate - Sheets B3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; B4
BGG 3-D Units - Sheet N1
BGG Exclusive Overlays - Sheets M3 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; M4

Uncommon Ogres - Sheets E5 and E6
All models are assembled, counters punched, and stored within the counter trays and garage. I Created foam board inserts to help prevent the contents from shifting/moving. Started to color code the Sponsor models on the exposed cardboard sides of the models, but lost interest in it and didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t finish color coding. 
Contents in very good condition. 
Can send pics if interested.</notes>

    <notes>GIANT DESIGNER_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S EDITION - BRAND NEW!
*** With every sale we donate a percentage to the Veterans Support Foundation (including this sale). ***
Wargame Depot has donated over $8,000 to this wonderful cause thanks, largely, to the wonderful Boardgamegeek community. Thank you so much for your continued support of Wargame Depot which has allowed us to give generously to the VSF.
Mint, new, unopened copy of the Designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Edition (retail version) monster in its original shipping box. Non-smoking environment and kept in a humidity-controlled location.
Shipping to be determined by location...write me and let me know your zip code for a quote . As an example, to NYC or Chicago it would be about $25. Shipping to the West Coast is about $35. I am willing to ship worldwide, but be prepared for extreme costs overseas.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the owner of Wargame Depot so I can accept Paypal, MO/Check, or MC/Visa/Discover/AMEX.
North Carolina residents pay 7% sales tax.
Cheers,
Jason</notes>
