But instead of using electrons, players use finger-flicks to send small pucks around the track, a la Carrom._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contents:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Eight car discs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     One black _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;spacer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; disc_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Six straightaways _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Ten 90-degree curves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Rail pieces for straights and curves_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     One Start/Finish line sticker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     One rule sheet with suggested track layouts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     One score pad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         Carabande was produced by Goldsieber and had only the single expansion with the Action Set.

PitchCar apparently also has two editions, where the first edition has the black laminate on the top and bottom of the track pieces, where the second edition only has the laminate on the top of the track pieces.

Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen. (This game doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in a 2kg 12.30 EUR box as it is to heavy!)
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.30€ worldwide and 8.20€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.</notes>

    <notes>PitchCar. Box is a little rough on two corners, but the set inside is complete and in very good condition.
As a bonus: I will also include a homemade PitchCar expansion which is fairly well done. I received this expansion when I made the purchase of this used PitchCar base game and even though the expansion is homemade, I think it adds excitement to the base set.
This is a heavy game, so shipping will be a little more than most games, but I will only charge the buyer actual shipping cost.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Goldseiber version, Carabande. Everything is present. Box has a bit of shelfwear, and the tiles are slightly nicked where the rails have been inserted and taken out, but nothing that effects gameplay. I can provide pictures if you want. </notes>

    <notes>AUDI Carabande by Goldsieber in a very good shape - hardly any wear, just played once or twice. Unfortunately the 2nd set of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;cars_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; is missing, so max. 4 players may enjoy this great game. Besides these 4 missing cars the game is totally complete.
Shipping to the US / Canada will be 32.00 Euros.
to Asia / Australia 37.00 Euros, within Europe 17 Euros. Other countries please ask.</notes>

Shipping costs shown are for an individual game. I will combine shipping as best I can. Large packages (10kg, say 6 games) are very cost-effective to ship internationally via DHL. Ask if you want a detailed price. Shipping this one game internationally is going to be quite expensive - £30+.

    <notes>This is the base game Carabande which is Out of Print.  
Note that I also have the very rare Expansion for this game with the jump for sale. (I will combine shipping)
For anyone that does not know, Carabande and Expansion do not have the problem of rails always slipping out of the track like Pitchcar does.  
The base game is in great condition and has been well used. Tracks show some normal wear on surface from play and also have wear where the rails fit in again because the rails fit tight so slight chipping occurs and is not avoidable, overall its all average wear. Box is solid but shows a good amount of wear (normal for age though), 2 corners were split and have been taped with clear tape. Box is heavy.

Will ship anywhere in the continental US for $12.95.  Shipping will probably be by US Parcel Post (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a heavy game!).  Shipping may cost more to Alaska or Hawaii.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game set only.  Pitchcar is in excellent shape, only played a handful of times.  The box has a few scuffs on it, which I tried to show to the best of my abilities in the pictures, but these blemishes are minor.  Game components themselves are in pristine condition.

It is the French edition of PitchCar.  Not that that affects the game as it is language independent and I have printed out the English rules.
Also the box is a little battered, though completely intact.

    <notes>PitchCar PLUS PitchCar Extension AND PitchCar Extension 2 from Ferti.  The pieces are here for all three sets, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all mixed together, so we can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tell which pieces are for the base game and which are for the expansion.  If you REALLY want one without the other(s), please contact us and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see whether we can figure it out.
Boxes:  Everything has been stored in the PitchCar and PitchCar Extension (1) box; the box for PitchCar Extension 2 is not included.  Both boxes have very light shelfwear with a few minor dings and dents.  The main PitchCar box bottom also has a 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; split along one edge because of the weight of all the PitchCar pieces.  Please note that the expansion box is the original brown corrugated cardboard version, not the fancy red one.  Overall the boxes are in excellent condition!
Components:  Complete and in like new condition!   The car discs for this version are the nice ones with the stamped patterns (i.e. no stickers).
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 14 lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

    <notes>Please see the ten photos on pages 2 and 3 of my user gallery (https://boardgamegeek.com/images/user/2330/chris-barnard) and below. The box is excellent except for a small split along a bottom edge (see photo). Some of the track pieces have minor scratches. All have been neatly stamped on the back with the letter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;c_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; to identify the set. Postage within the UK by MyHermes for £7.50. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a heavy game so postage elsewhere is prohibitive (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had to tick the post to Europe box because the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Geek doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have an option only to sell within your own country unless you are American). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling Extension 2 and the Crossroads and all three can be sent for £7.50! Cash on collection is also possible from the Leeds / York area.</notes>
