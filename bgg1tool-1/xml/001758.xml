   <description>Advanced HeroQuest is a revised and expanded version of the Milton Bradley HeroQuest game.  The basic concept is the same: four heroes venture into a dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure, but Advanced HeroQuest's rules are more detailed and complex._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The major additions and changes include:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    random dungeon generation system_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    modular game board_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    ranged combat_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    multiple colleges of magic and spell books_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    henchmen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    critical hits and fumbles_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    fate points (the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;undo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; feature)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Games Workshop set Advanced HeroQuest in the Warhammer universe, presumably to foster sales of their miniatures.

    <notes>ADVANCED HEROQUEST - Games Workshop (1989)
I studied the game like a maniac when I was in high school. I wanted so badly to play it, but my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;friends_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; never had the same enthusiasm. Sadly, it has been sitting in my closet for many years, and I think I would rather let someone else get some use out of it.
• The box is pretty square and VERY minorly damaged.
• All pieces are accounted for including the rule book.
• Rule book has yellow highlighting on it (my studies).
• Game has NEVER been played. So sad.
• Shipping to the Continental US only please.
Asking Price: $80.00 US
Shipping Costs: To Be Determined based on destination

All 36 figures (4 heroes, 12 henchmen, 20 skaven) are unpainted and include their stands.  The only damage is on 2 figures (1 broken henchman weapon and 1 missing skaven tail) and the box has a crush on one corner and minor shelfwear around the edges.
Includes rulebook, 6 upright doors, 3 large floor tiles, 7 small floor tiles, corridors, junctions, scenery, monster counters, fate counters, wound counters, 2 dice, etc.

    <notes>Game has been in the attic for 15 years ! Looks like its been played a few times, although not all the counters have been punched. Figures are not painted. All the pieces are there and have been checked. Box shows some signs fo age, one corner is split but otherwise, given its age, its in good condition.
Postage to the UK would be about £5, to the USA closer to £15.  Thanks</notes>

    <notes>Overall, the game is in very good to good condition. Things to note:
 - some minis are painted (not a great paint job but not awful either)
 - there is an extra skaven mini, from Dark World: Village of Fear I think
 - the box is a bit bent (like all GW boxes of that era, the cardboard is too thin and flimsy)
 - the 6 plastic doors are broken, but all pieces are there and can be glued back together (I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t done it for fear of them breaking again during shipping)
Apart from these issues the rest of the component are in great shape.
BONUS: three White Dwarf articles, with a new quest, new characters, new spells and equipment.
Contact me if you want pictures or more information, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to answer.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Okay, a very nice set here, and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bonuses! This set is housed in the somewhat rare AHQ Paint Set box (this is the square GW box, like Kerrunch and Mighty Warriors). The square box just fits better, so I discarded the long box. 
Great game, and a good deal, here. 
Included as a bonus are all of the Terror in the Dark components, except for the rulebook!</notes>

    <notes>English Language Games Workshop Edition. All components included and in excellent condition, except for one Skaven with a broken sword tip (included.) Sheets are all unmarked and extra copies of those and reference tables are included.
Game box in very good condition, though there is some minor wear on the corners and edges as would be expected - great for a 20 year old game.</notes>

    <notes>Ok, before you get too excited.
The box is battered, like after 3 rounds with Mike Tyson.
However the components are all great.
...and the really good news is that there is are nearly 2 full sets of components in the one box. one complete set for sure and maybe 3/4 of another set. So lots of Heroquest goodness :)
The really bad news is that the manual is missing so I can only offer a print out of this. Not ideal I know. Although 
Feel free to ask questions.
Can pick up from Twickenham area if you want. UK postage will likely be £7.
cheers,
James</notes>

    <notes>Box dishing but in great shape for material and age. Game is complete EXCEPT missing original 2d12. I can pack in another (non-original) 2d12 or not at recipient_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s option.  Only damage to components is two or three broken swords from skaven -- blades still packed in if you want to attempt repair . Many but not all minis still on sprues.  All minis unpainted.  Cardboard is punched.  Pictures or further description of anything upon request;  I was torn between listing this as Good or Very Good and elected to err on the conservative side.
Buyer pays actual shipping from 02145 and may choose shipping method.  May pickup locally in 02145 for cash (BGG will get its cut regardless).</notes>

    <notes>Very good condition though box is squashed and corner damaged please see photos.

All figures present some painted. 2 Henchman have damaged weapons, spare bases and shields included. All tiles and cards.
Wheight is 1.3k, 43cm long, 29cm wide, 8cm deep,
Postage liable to be excessive, I found and would recommend this:
Royal Mail International Tracked _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Signed
3 to 5 working days delivery aim Up to £250 for loss or damage with Delivery Confirmation £17.15*  Europe.
£28 for South Africa (for comparison) with £25 insurance.
I priced cheapest Landmark Global at £28, with only £25 insurance, they won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t let me book more insurance until I book the parcel.  Which is very annoying.
The asterix is because it is estimated. I can only get a confirmed price at the post office. If you are prepared to pay me an approximated postage I will refund any difference when they confirm.</notes>
