   <description>A tradeable card game covering the events of the Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;lost_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;health_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tapping_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. Also importantly, this is not a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;draw one_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game but a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;hand-filling_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;shadow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ended_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.  The following sets were released:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Fellowship of the Ring_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Mines of Moria_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3 Realms of the Elf-Lords_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;4 The Two Towers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;5 Battle of Helm's Deep_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;6 Ents of Fangorn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;7 Return of the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;8 Siege of Gondor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;9 Reflections_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;10 Mount Doom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;11 Shadows (Starting with this Set, Minion Cultures were re-formatted)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;12 Black Rider_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;13 Bloodlines_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;14 Expanded Middle Earth_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;15 The Hunters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;16 Wraith Collection_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;17 Rise of Saruman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;18 Treachery and Deceit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;19 Ages' End_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is quite simply, an IMMENSE collection.  TONS of foils, rares, promos, you name it.  easily 10,000+ cards through Reflections.  The time has come to move on.  You won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find another collection like this.
I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even list all the rares, but you can ask anything, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll answer. (as long as it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not for a listing)
I have over two sets of the Tengwar cards, plus two whole sets of Countdown cards (with some extras)
Believe me, this one is nutso!  There are enough cards here for 3-4 people, easily.</notes>

    <notes>A long card box mostly full of LOTR ccg cards. There are intact Aragorn and Gandalf starter decks. Gimli and another Gandalf starter deck are in the mix, along with the contents of many boosters and copies of the rules. I did not scavenge any cards from these, so any rare cards that were in the boosters are still there.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think they put out any foil cards in those early card packs. Approximately 750 cards... all in very good shape. 
Plenty of fodder to learn this game and strategize your decks. Yours for 10$ and the cost of the stamps and packaging.
Shipping cost is exact postage plus 1$ for packaging/handling. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll mail it anyway you want, parcel post, priority, or express.
USA seller, with perfect ebay feedback I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refer you to upon request.
Note: Shipping to Europe and other nations outside the USA is expensive and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only ship there to bidders with multiple positive feedback.</notes>

    <notes>Large collection, probably 1500-3000 cards? I acquired most of it through a trade, and I also opened 3 booster boxes worth of cards myself and then never even played them. So there are tons of rares. This is a GREAT set to jump into this game. I never got a chance to play and it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look like I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ever have to time to at this point-
GM for more info if you need specifics.
Shipping cost would probably be $15 for USPS large flat rate box if I can get it all to fit in there.</notes>

    <notes>Here is what I have:
Mines of Moria Expansion:
  - 1 box of boosters (this contains 36 booster packs, 24 are unopened, the other 12 are opened).  Exactly 395 cards - so one is missing.
-=-=-=-=-
The Fellowship of the Rings (original release):
   6 boxes of boosters, including several starter decks.  However, all the cards
   are mixed together, total is a bit more than 2650 cards.
   Want to mention that 3 of the boxes were basically almost all duplicates of each 
   other.  In the first release of the game, the initial distribution had problems like 
   that, which they fixed in later distributions.  So I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not charging for the duplicates, 
   but they are included (doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hurt to have extras, especially if free).
-=-=-=-
So about 3000 cards total.
