   <description>In 18Lilliput, players try to build up the best railroad network by using action cards to get richer than the other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Every player starts with a railroad corporation and a character that gives them a special ability during the game. The game is limited to eight rounds of play, and every round, each player may select two action cards from a common pool to undertake activities on behalf of their railroads. These actions include laying new track, upgrading track, buying trains, buying new shares or opening a new company, or simply getting money into one's personal cash or into a company's treasury._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After the action selection phase, each company runs its trains and earns money, which can be withheld for future investments (trains, track, railheads) or paid out to the shareholders. This decision will influence the share price value of the company in question._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of the game, players sum their cash on hand with the value of their shares, and whoever has the biggest total wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;18xx players will find a lot of used and tried mechanisms, as well as many new elements, mingled into a quick and exciting card game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;description from the designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Will ship priority mail. Will check to see if this fits in a Regional A box with would max out at ~$11, otherwise a medium flat rate would be ~$13. Would also consider Priority Flat Rate envelope with the game box padded in bubble wrap this tends to be ~$8. 
Will consider shipping to Canada, will need to discuss first as rates from the USA are quite absurd.</notes>
