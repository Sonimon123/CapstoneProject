    <notes>Very good condition. I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t gotten around to counting all of the pieces in this game, but the previous owner has sorted them all into little plastic snap cases, and given that attention to detail, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;d guess that they are all there. The rulebook is filled with checkmarks, as if the owner had checked off each rule as they read it. I think I also have some general supplements for this game, containing additional scenarios and such. Pictures available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>The box shows a fair amount of wear and has one corner split and taped. One side of the box has part of a Toys R Us sticker on it. The boards and counters, however, are in excellent shape showing almost no wear from play. The counters are as follows: 175 allied pieces, 129 german pieces and 55 white general use counters. There are some blank counters in the mix that could be used for replacements.</notes>

    <notes>This purchase by auction reserved for Mark Fischer.
Vintage 1974 Avalon Hill game #812.  Game of Tactical Warfare on the Western Front 1944-45.
Box is solid with shelf wear.
Sprues are partially punched.  The game is complete except that there are supposed to be 384 tiles. I have counted three times and 2 tiles are missing.  I think more than likely that they were blanks that I threw out decades ago when I first got the game.  However, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know for sure, and there are certainly other blanks in the box.</notes>

    <notes>The copy is in fantastic shape! The counters are unpunched and the scenario cards _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; charts are still attached to each other. There is very little shelf wear. It is mainly on the bottom of the lid where the box stood upright on and slid on the shelf. The rulebook looks like it was lightly thumbed through. There is some slight staining of the box and a tiny bit on the map, but it is wonderful condition.</notes>

    <notes>Panzer Leader (1974) from Avalon Hill
Box: Moderate to heavy shelf-wear and several dings, dents and wrinkles. One corner of the top is split. Overall the box is in good condition. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not a collectible item by any means, but it does its job perfectly well and when placed on its side will look good on your shelf.
Contents: Complete and in very good condition! The counters are like new. The boards show some wear around the folds, but look excellent. The rule book, Designer Notes book, and 7 charts are in excellent condition, with some signs of wear, but nothing too bad.
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: Â£5.50
European Postage: Â£11.50
Rest of World Postage: Â£22.00
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS:
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment.
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice.
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS:
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months! There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently Â£39 per package for Small Packets, Â£150 for International Standard).
CUSTOMS:
Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.

    <notes>Game is complete, with counters clipped and organized in ziplock bags. The game rulebook and the situation sheets are in perfect condition. The box has a little shelf wear but NO DENTS.
The game is otherwise in like new condition, showing NO WEAR at all. For all these years it has been stored in a closed cabinet in my home, under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. 
Lastly, see the picture for your reference. 
I will ship worldwide at buyerâ€™s expenses. Shipping to the US is 18 Euros, to Europe 13 Euros and within Italy 9 Euros. I will check shipping rates to other locations on demand and revert.
Paypal or a bank draft preferred. Feel free to email me with questions!
(IMPORTANT NOTICE: I am away from home on most weekdays, so allow a couple of days for a reply to your queries). 
Thanks for looking! Riccardo

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: Â£6.50
European Postage: Â£14.25
Rest of World Postage: Â£26.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS:
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment.
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice.
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS:
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months! There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently Â£39 per package for Small Packets, Â£150 for International Standard).

Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.

Game is in very good condition and has been verified as complete except for the rulebook (can be found online or I can email you a copy in PDF format, but be warned that it is 44 pages - just remind me if you need it emailed!). Most counters have been punched and stored in a Ziploc bag, about 48 counters have not yet been punched. Box has a little shelf wear but overall the box is in good shape </notes>

    <notes>These are actually two copies.  There are two sets of boards, two sets of players aids (one ratty one on the left).  And two sets of counters.  There is one complete set of counters, and one almost complete set.   The almost complete sets seems to be missing 2 US 76 mm AT, 3 US Rifle and 1 German Rifle.   It has 16 op fire and 20 spotted counters and 1 die.  And the boxes have seen better days A perfect way to add to your existing PL for a monster scenario.  So basically one good copies with a lot of extras</notes>

My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He loved his games and took excellent care of them!  If they were played, we no food or drink was allowed.  Smoke free environment...   He passed away in 2012 and it is time for the games to find new homes.  Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>I purchased this game new in 1984 but have never played it. The counters are all punched but have been in protective zip-loc bags their entire life. All of the Situation cards and maps as well as the Combat resolution and target elevation tables are present and in perfect condition.The game boards are still stiff and look freshly printed. The rule book shows some light cover creasing but no highlighting or writing throughout. The box shows some shelf wear but is still solid with the exception of the box top which has one split corner (lower left). The bottom is still rock solid. Pictures available on request. As I said, I am the original owner of this game and it has been in a climate controlled and per/smoke free environment since I purchased it. I ship to USA addresses only as overseas shipping can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be tracked. Same or next business day shipping. An excellent playing copy worthy of any collection.</notes>

    <notes>Tank warfare in WW11. The Germans throwing everything they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got at the advancing Americans. Marshall your tanks, your infantry and your air assault and see what kind of a commander you are. The game gives you more than 16 different situations, enabling players to re-create battles as they really happened on a platoon and battery level. The game is in good shape (some of the counters are not even punched out) although the box is a bit scuffed.</notes>

    <notes>Thi is a realistic game simulating tactical combat  on the western front during world war 2. The twenty game situations cover the gamut of combat encounters between the allies and their german adversaries. The four piece mapboard allows for varied examples of typical terrain in france and germany , and example scenarios suggest  varying strengths for  
th offense and defense. the box box a bit scuffed and one corner is slightly dented, but the contents are pristine and the counters have never even been punched.</notes>
