   <description>Fields of Green takes place in the second half of the 20th century. Players take the role of farm owners trying to expand their property and business. By adding fields, livestock and facilities, they build an economic engine that will bring them closer to victory._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fields of Green, inspired by Among the Stars, is played over four rounds (years) during which players draft cards and add them to their ever-expanding farms. At the end of each year comes the harvest season when they must water their fields, feed their livestock, and pay maintenance costs in order to receive valuable resources that will allow them to further expand in the next year._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Through various means, player eventually convert their wealth to victory points, and the player who gathers the most by the end of the fourth year wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Note: This is the Kickstarter copy and there have been many posts that the inside of the actual game box isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a pretty sight, but that in most cases the actual game pieces are perfectly fine. As this has not been opened I cannot tell you whether this is the case or not. Buyer assumes risk of the contents within the game (ie: no returns), but I will help remedy via the kickstarter campaign if pieces are missing or damaged to get replacements shipped to you.

    <notes>Kickstarter edition! Everything is in great condition and I worked very carefully to punch everything out, based on the Kickstarter feedback. Only played the game once and it just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t connect for my game group. I taped/fixed the only issue which was a little rip on the insert which apparently happened to every Kickstarter delivery.
Shipping looks to be in the $7-$8 range but can provide a quote if needed.</notes>

    <notes>Fields of Green is a great game about resource management and card drafting. This is the unique kickstarter edition which includes all of the stretch goals including the burlap bag, additional cards, and mini expansion. During the shipping process, the box insert was damaged with a small hole approximately 2 in x 2 in. Also, some of the small pieces were torn during the punch out process, but the damage is minimal and does not affect game play. The cards are in perfect condition and the art is beautiful. This game comes from a smoke-free, pet-free home and the only reason it is being sold is because my wife and I prefer the heavies. Also, the cards have all been sleeved in premium 90 micron cards sleeves and extra sleeves will come with the game. 
The buyer will need to cover shipping.</notes>
