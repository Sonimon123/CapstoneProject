   <description>The players put together four shows in any order: Queenie, Wolf, King Lear, and Ballet.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping costs shown are for an individual game. I will combine shipping as best I can. Large packages (5kg, say 6 games) are very cost-effective to ship internationally via DHL. Ask if you want a detailed price.

    <notes>Queen Games (QNG 60692)
The players put together four shows in any order: Queenie, Wolf, King Lear, and Ballet. To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards. Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles. Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.</notes>

Whether on Broadway in New York or the Spielbudenplatz in Hamburg, life in the theater bubbles over and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the middle in it. The glittery world of show stars lures, and everyone wants a long evening of enchantment.
Four musicals and five cities - as one of up to six managers, you try to make the best musical in town. With Showmanager, you pull the strings. Achieve success with the smart selection from 120 actors, the skillful employment of your scarce funds and the feeling for the suitable musical at the right place. The public is demanding and the competition never sleeps. Only the best manager will receive thunderous applause.
Raise the curtain on Showmanager - a exciting game for two to six clever impressionists.</notes>

    <notes>Played only once or twice. Really nice components and pretty fun party game, but unfortunately my friends disagree.
I do not use PayPal, after being scammed a couple of times. I will allow payment through PayPal as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;sending money to friend/family_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Otherwise, bank transfer would be my preffered choice or cash, with local pick-up.
Contact me before making a purchase, if you wanna know the shipping costs.
Verzenden in NL kan met Kiala, DHL of TNT. Afhalen kan in Dordrecht, Rotterdam en Rijswijk op afspraak.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through GM.</notes>

An idea of the likely postage charge can be found at: https://www.royalmail.com/personal/sending-parcels
(don’t forget to allow for the weight of a recycled cardboard box I will ship the game in to you)
FYI I am a private seller, just looking to clear out some space - I am going to be selling off much of my collection, and have a number of other items for sale, please check them out. 
I am always happy to combine shipping costs where possible. 
And if there is an older game you are looking for, please let me know.
I may well have a copy and be tempted to sell it to you.</notes>
