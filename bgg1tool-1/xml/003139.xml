   <description>Each player has a backpack with room for 12 tools, provisions, trading goods, or treasures.  The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;explore,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;About half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;adventure_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;camp_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Goldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Includes a few bonus painted western figures.  Since I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to get the site to include my pictures with the listing, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve uploaded a picture of the figures to my gallery, here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/image/828934/lindsey?size=original
There is a slight bow to the box top, and light wear on the edges of the box top and bottom.  Does not come with the original German language rules, but does have a nice printout of the English translation of the rulebook and play examples.  The tiles and tokens are in very good condition.  As a bonus, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include five appropriate prepainted figures.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>Goldland (2002) from Gold Sieber Spiele
The game is brand new and in shrink-wrap, but there is a severely damaged corner. The shrink-wrap is torn and the box is ripped. The damage is completely cosmetic, though; you can see a bit inside the box and there is only cardboard where the damage occurred - the parts and board were not anywhere near the damage. So here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a chance to get a new copy of this great, hard-to-find game at a reduced price! Also, the damage is to the back upper-right of the box, so you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even see the damage when you put the box on the shelf.
Shipping will be based on a weight of 5 lbs. from zip code 85208. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact us for a shipping quote before purchasing the game so we can avoid any problems - shipping a game of this weight can be very expensive!
Please take a look at the hundreds of other games we have listed for sale. Combined shipping can save you lots of money, especially for International buyers. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us!</notes>

    <notes>Game has obviously seen very little use - but there are a couple flaws to box top.  A very faint indentation line and a couple of pin sized scuff spots. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no insert which I assume is as published as there are just too many pieces to fit in one.  Comes with both the original German rules plus a color English translation.  (Note: Game was never released in English.)</notes>

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my groupâs preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>German edition of Wolfgang Kramer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Goldland.  A rare game to find stateside from this renowned designer.
Played once.  All components in new condition.  TONS of tiles, counters, and wooden pieces.  There are minor scrapes on the box from shelving, the most significant one being a long thin scrape on the bottom back edge of the box.  It doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t penetrate through the box and does not obscure any artwork or text.
Includes a printout of the English rules translation.  All components are language independent.
Kept in a smoke-free environment.
Buyer pays shipping.  I will contact you with the cost for confirmation.  (Note box is slightly larger and taller than most big box games.)</notes>
