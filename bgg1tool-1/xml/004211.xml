   <description>This simulation of the Second Manassas campaign is the first volume in Avalon Hill's new series of strategic Civil War games. Future games will link up with the Stonewall Jackson's Way map to portray much of the Civil War's eastern theater. This is one of the first Civil War games to concentrate on a specific campaign rather than a single battle. Despite its rich detail, the game is fairly easy to learn and play. Indeed, several scenarios can be played to completion in about an hour. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The two beautiful game maps portray central Virginia as it was in the summer of 1862, featuring roads. turnpikes, railroads, rivers, mountains - even bridges and fords! These highly accurate maps are based on original Civil War maps in state and county archives. The players control Union and Confederate military units in turns representing one day of real time. The game features five Basic scenarios, two Advanced scenarios, and a detailed day~by-day historical analysis of the actual campaign. Stonewall Jackson's Way will appeal to Civil War buffs of all types as well as to those who are just being introduced to this dramatic period of American history. Its interactive game system assures that each game will be unpredictable, exciting, and competitive._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;FEATURES _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Corps leaders * Infantry and Cavalry units * Artillery values _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Force marches * Burning Railroad stations _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Grand assaults * Flank attacks * Fatigue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Clear, Rolling, Rough, Woods, Mountain terrain _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Demoralization * Entrenchments * Railroad movement _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Cavalry retreat * Building bridges _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Rain * Depots * Supply lines * Foraging _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SCENARIOS _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Cedar Mountain _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lee vs. Pope _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Stuart's Cavalry Raid _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Jackson's _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Foot Cavalry_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     From the Rappahannock to Bull Run _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     From the Rapidan to the Rappahannock (Advanced Game, short version) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     From the Rapidan to Manassas (Advanced Game, long version)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;CONTENTS: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Counter Sheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;x32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Mapsheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Rules Booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Charts and Tables Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;3 Displays Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 6-sided dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;1 Counter Tray_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;TIME SCALE: One day per turn _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;MAP SCALE: One mile per hex _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;UNIT SCALE: Divisions and brigades (with corps leaders) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;PLAYERS: One, two, or teams _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;PLAYING TIME: 1 hour for introductory scenarios, 2 to 12 hours for other scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;(from the back of the box)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game is complete, with counters clipped and organized in their original AH tray. The S map has been trimmed on the edge where it overlaps with the N map so that he two align _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; fit perfectly on top of each other. The game is otherwise in like new condition (was played only once!) with displays, rules, etc., showing NO WEAR at all. 
The box has no shelf wear either and has been sitting in a closed cabinet in my home, under controlled conditions of humidity and temperature. Also, see the picture for your reference. 
I will ship worldwide at buyer’s expenses. 
(Note: Standard air shipping to the US was 18 Euros last time I looked a few weeks ago). 
I am unfamiliar with receiving payments via Paypal, so a bank draft is preferred. 
Feel free to email me with questions. 
(IMPORTANT NOTICE: I am away from home on most weekdays, so allow a couple of days for a reply to your queries). 
Thanks for looking!  Riccardo

    <notes>Stonewall Jackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Way is the first game in Avalon Hill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series.  This is the orginal game, opened, with counters unpunched, and all components accounted for in unplayed condition.  The box has one slight scuff in the front upper corner.  The litho and graphics are excellent. I purchased the game new.  The back of the box litho was manufactured using the In the Valley Graphics.  So I will discount accordingly, but please understand that all components are correct, and that the box is conservatively an 8.5 to 9.  It would be hard to find a game from this period in such nice condition, and it has never been played.
I am a meticulous shipper.  Prefer PayPal, but will accept your personal check and ship once check clears.</notes>
