Some even camped on the village square, waiting for houses to become available. Thus, the school is once again filled with the laughter of children and the tavern is filled with playful echoes of conversations, punctuated by the clink of filled glasses.

As in the original game of The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow, players assume characters in the charming village, with some players secretly being werewolves who tear apart one of the human citizens each night. However, in Village, players will also assume a trade/profession._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note that The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow: Village is both a standalone game and an expansion for the original game, although the card sizes in Village differ from those in the original game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Asmodée (ASM VIL01US)
After the terrible tragedy of the so-called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;New Moon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, the village became a desert of ruins. Many years later, some brave outsiders rebuilt the village stone by stone, with the treasures amassed from their latest adventures. They then launched a clarion call to encourage all homeless adventurers to come live in this new ideal village.
From all corners of the country, volunteers flocked to live in brand new houses, farms and shops. Some even camped on the village square, waiting for houses to become available. Thus, the school is once again filled with the laughter of children and the tavern is filled with playful echoes of conversations, punctuated by the clink of filled glasses.
However, there remain claims that werewolves exist among the new community!
Welcome to The Village! As in the original game (Werewolves of Miller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Hollow), players will assume characters in the charming village. However, in The Village, players will also assume a trade/profession.
Note: The Village is not a mere expansion, but rather a stand-alone game. The card sizes are changed from the original.
