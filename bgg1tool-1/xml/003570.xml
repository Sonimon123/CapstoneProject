   <description>Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;cha cha_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;) by completing circuits around the yard._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Goal: To _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;cha cha_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tail feathers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pathway_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;yard_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tail feathers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;ahead_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;behind_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;leapfrogs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I have three copies of the Dragon Tales edition of the game. 
They are Ebay and thrift finds and are in varying degrees of use and completeness (the cardboard inserts are missing in one.) 
All are playable and all have the main components. 
I will sell them off best-quality first. First buyer will get the best cared for edition (and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll lower the price as editions are sold off.) 
Please provide me with your email address and I will send photos so you know what you are getting before making a purchase.  </notes>

Today, there is chaos in the chicken yard!!! Todays practice for the chicken cha cha Olympics is feather stealing. Each chicken cha chas to catch each of their opponents without being caught themselves. Their reward for catching another chicken is tail feathers. The first chicken to have all tail feathers is the winner! But only a chicken who knows what is in the chicken yard will be able to catch the others and win the game. A chicken with a leaky memory will find himself standing bare-rumped and medalless when the prizes are distributed.</notes>
