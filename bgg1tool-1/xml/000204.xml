   <description>Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England.  There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.  Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares.  When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one.  The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande version. This game is complete, unpunched and never played.  Unfortunately the box suffered some damage during shipping.  One corner has a dent which caused a split corner and a tiny bit of tearing along the edge.  This corner has been neatly repaired with transparent tape.  The opposite corner has a small dent on the upper side.  Five counters have very small rippling on them from being crushed.  Otherwise all other components including map are in excellent unpunched condition.
Shipping will be at cost from central Canada.  I accept Paypal, cash, international money order (pink not green if you are in the U.S.) and Canadian money order.
Thanks for looking!!</notes>

Price is for for payment via Personal Check, Money Order, or Bank Check. Please add $3 if you are paying via paypal (sadly I have an upgraded paypal account where I have to pay transaction fees no matter where the seller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s funds come from).

Pictures included here are actual pictures of the copy for sale here.

    <notes>Compete against your rivals by building railroads and trading shares in the classic (and OOP) game by Reiner Knizia. 
This is the English-language reprint from Rio Grande Games.  This game is complete with all original materials in very good condition (some of the cash has minor wear, but it was very cheap and flimsy to start with), and also includes a printed Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Aid at no extra cost. A great addition to any true gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s collection.
This game has been adult-owned in a smoke-free, child-free, pet-free household. Played once.

Both appear to still be intact.  This also resulted in minor crease across the bottom of the box.  Please see the pictures for the corner damage.  Of note, the damage does not appear to have been high enough to damage the board.</notes>

Language: Dutch
2 to 4 players
12 year and older
Duration: about 75 min
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,320 kg
Theme: Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s England. There are seven different rail companies that players can expand. Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares. When two companies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; rail touch, the railways merge to become one. The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game.

    <notes>German Edition:
Game is unplayed.  I have put all the pieces into bags but did not play the game.  
I had the game on my shelf and the box was bent on the bottom from another game.  I took a picture of the bottom so that you see the crease.
The top of the box looks great as does the rest of the box.  The problem is on the bottom. The structure of the box is still good as seen by the picture.
The game will fit in a Priority large flat box.  The cost for shipping will be $8.00 .</notes>

Condition Notes:
Played once or twice and in good shape.
Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new in original shrinkwrap. 999 Games (Dutch) edition that I bought directly from a Dutch online retailer. Components are language independent and English rules are here on BGG.
 Price is for for payment via Personal Check, Money Order, or Bank Check. Please add $3 if you are paying via paypal (sadly I have an upgraded paypal account where I have to pay transaction fees no matter where the seller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s funds come from).
 Shipping will be actual cost via USPS with delivery confirmation, shipping from Londonderry, NH (03053). I will only ship within the USA.  I could also ship via FedEx if you wish which may be cheaper (especially if you have a non-residential address, ie. such as work).
 Pictures included here are actual pictures of the copy for sale here.
 Thanks!
 Jeff
Also see my high BGG trade rating http://www.boardgamegeek.com/trademgr.php3?action=viewfeedback_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=JeffyJeff
I also will consider selling other games on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; list (and run through the BGG MP) and of course buying multiple games will likely save you on shipping (and I will consider discounts for buying multiple games).</notes>

    <notes>Opened and played.  Box has shelf wear, and interior divider is a bit crushed.  But all parts and board in excellent condition. Rio Grande version.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $8.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Rio Grande Games English edition.  All game components are like new.  The top portion of the box is in excellent condition.  The bottom half of the box has some minor creasing in one corner (it was like this when I purchased it).  All 4 corners are still solid, so it is really just a cosmetic problem on the bottom half of the box - other than that this game is like new.</notes>

    <notes>Game is as good as new. Shrinkwrapped removed, game admired and never played. Cards are still in shrinkwrap, nothing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been punched, box in pristine condition. I printed out a copy of the English rules and put it in the box, is all that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been done with the game.
The game itself is language-independent.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a standard square box, and shipping within the U.S. should be $12.30 at most. Email me with any questions! I have 100% positive feedback here and on eBay. Taking a loss on this one; I just won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ever have the time to play it, so it might as well go to someone who can appreciate it.
