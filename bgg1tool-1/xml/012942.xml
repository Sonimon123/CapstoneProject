   <description>No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rules are simple.  Each turn, players have two options:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but a 2011 edition supports up to seven._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game was originally published in Germany by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English.  The game has subsequently been released in other countries under an assortment of names._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Designed by Thorsten Gimmler
Good card games can be so simple: either take a card or pay a chip. Anyone can make that decision, right? However, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a catch - in fact there are two. Nobody wants the cards, not even for free, because they give you points in a game where you need to have the fewest points to win. And the chips? They are scarce, very scarce.
An excellent filler game that appeals to non-gamers as well.
Contents: 33 cards, 55 chips
No. of players: 3-5
Ages: 8+
Playing time: 20 minutes</notes>

Yes we can combine orders at significant shipping discounts.
Please paypal payments to maydaygames@gmail.com. Be SURE you include what item you are buying with the payment.
Combined shipping works as follows for domestic (48 lower states) orders:
Highest price shipping item: Full shipping cost
2nd-4th highest priced items: 50% off shipping cost for each of these items.
5th-10th highest priced shipping items: 60% off shipping costs for each of these items.
11th+ highest priced shipping items: 75% off shipping for all the rest of the items.
As an example say you purchased 15 games, 3 of them with $10 shipping, 5 of them with $8 shipping and 7 of them with $4 shipping. The total shipping for the 15 items would be:
Full shipping on the first item: $10.00
50% off shipping on items 2-4: $14.00 (50% off $10, $10 and $8, the next highest shipping cost items)
60% off shipping on items 5-10: $14.40 (60% off of 3 items at $8 shipping and 3 more items at $4 shipping = $36)
75% off shipping on items 11-15: $4.00 (75% off 4 items at $4)
Total shipping on these 15 items then would be $10+$14+$14.40 + $4 = $42.40 shipping. This is just an example and your results will vary depending on what you buy of course!</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4031)
Good card games can be so simple: either take a card or pay a chip. Anyone can make that decision, right? However, there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a catch - in fact there are two. Nobody wants the cards, not even for free, because they give you points in a game where you need to have the fewest points to win. And the chips? They are scarce, very scarce. 
An excellent filler game that appeals to non-gamers as well.

You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.
If you buy more games, then I make all in one package!
We have a large private collection of games. Due to space and time constraints we must rid ourselves of some of the games. Therefore, these are private sales.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete. The cards are sleeved. There is minor wear on the edges and corners of the box. There is a sticker on the barcode of the box. The cards and instruction manual show little to no wear. There is no crushing on the box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if this is the 1st or 2nd Z-Man edition. If this matters to you, please contact me to help me figure out which edition I have. This would make a great addition to any collection! Standard retail version. Offers welcome!</notes>
