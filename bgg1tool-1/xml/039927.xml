   <description>Last Train to Wensleydale is a railway themed game set in the Yorkshire Dales. The aim of the game is to move stone, cheese, and passengers from the Dales to the major trunk routes served by the North Eastern Railway and the Midland Railway._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Valleys play a large part in dictating where you can build track. Once you have built a line you must acquire second hand engines and rolling stock to move the goods and passengers that your line connects to. Such a line quickly becomes unprofitable and it pays to have one of the two major companies take it over from you._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Building track can also be made more difficult by local residents who object to railways being built on their land. To overcome such opposition you require influence in government to arrange the necessary compulsory purchase orders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description of the game, from the backside of the box:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For many years the train gaming world has been waiting for a game about moving cheese in the Yorkshire Dales. That wait is now over!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As the director of a small railway company who has inveigled investment money from gullible locals, it's up to you to see if you can actually make a profit from building track amongst some of the most difficult terrain in England. There's stone to be moved from quarries, and cheese to be moved to market. You might also find the odd passenger who wants to travel to civilization._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;However, standing in your way is the local farmer, who really does not want you to build on his land. Fortunately you can buy favours from the necessary government committee to deal with such irritations. You will also need a few contacts with other train companies, as you will need their second-hand engines to run on your lines. Finally, once you've sucked all the profit that you can from a route, you must off-load it to a major train company before you are saddled with the losses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International bidders are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>This signed and numbered limited edition has been taken very good care of and only played once. just opened the shrink-wrap last night.  LTTW is a fun game, but sadly i have bills to pay and must begin liquidating my large game collection.  i just want to find a good home for it!  please note if you are outside the U.S., i will need to recalculate shipping costs for you.  This game retails new at Thoughthammer for 90 dollars.  thanks for looking and serious buyers only, please.</notes>

This game has been played once. All wooden components are accounted for as well as the rules and map.  Everything is still in excellent condition.
The game box is starting to show signs of wear and tear. The box bottom has a small tear in the cover surrounding the box.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 1/2 inch running up the fold to the bottom right corner.  While it is visible, you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see it unless you are looking for it.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>This has been opened and played a couple of times. Corners of box show slight wear, but nothing serious at all. Game is in great condition.
Shipping games in the US usually runs around 13.50. Outside the U.S. the cost can be 40-80 dollars. I get my prices, and ship through the US postal service. If you can get it from me to you cheaper, I would love to know about it.</notes>
