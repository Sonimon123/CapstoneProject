   <description>Alea Iacta Est is Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Die is Cast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players take on the role of Caesar and compete for the most prestige points.  This happens by clever placement of his/her eight dice, which are placed on five different buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the Castrum (barracks), new provinces can  be conquered,  while patricians can be recruited at the Forum Romanum to be sent to those provinces.  At the Senatus, cards can be won for bonuses that will be kept secret until the end of the game.  The Templum awards prestige points directly from the Goddess Fortuna.  Each die that does not win any of these ends the round at the Latrina, where it provides its owner with a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;repete!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; chip, which can be used to re-roll dice or can be traded in two-to-one for prestige points at the end of the game.  Each building has special rules as to how the dice can be placed, allowing many tactical possibilities with any roll of the dice._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each round ends when one player has placed his/her last die, and after 5 rounds (6 rounds with 2-3 players), the patricians are organized in their provinces, the senate cards are revealed, and the scores are totaled.  The player with the most prestige points wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 395)
Type: Set collecting
Number of players: 2-5
Age of players: 9++
Length: 60 minutes
Game Description: 
Each player tries to be Caesar and then works to prove he is indeed Caesar by collecting fame points. The challenge is to intelligently allocate your eight rolled dice among the five buildings to acquire the fame you need to win the game. Clever Caesar would use these resources to conquer new provinces and assign suitable patricians to them, adding to his already enormous fame. Can you do the same? You will also need to show diplomacy in the senate and maybe visit the temple for some luck from Fortuna to win.
Although dice-rolling is luck-based, the options offered here go well beyond luck. You cannot control (well, sometimes you can, actually) the dice you get, but clever allocation of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; dice rolls can yield good results. When the dice allocation is done, the buildings are scored and another set begins.
At game end, the player with the most fame points.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 395)
Type: Set collecting
Number of players: 2-5
Age of players: 9++
Length: 60 minutes
Game Description: 
Each player tries to be Caesar and then works to prove he is indeed Caesar by collecting fame points. The challenge is to intelligently allocate your eight rolled dice among the five buildings to acquire the fame you need to win the game. Clever Caesar would use these resources to conquer new provinces and assign suitable patricians to them, adding to his already enormous fame. Can you do the same? You will also need to show diplomacy in the senate and maybe visit the temple for some luck from Fortuna to win.
Although dice-rolling is luck-based, the options offered here go well beyond luck. You cannot control (well, sometimes you can, actually) the dice you get, but clever allocation of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; dice rolls can yield good results. When the dice allocation is done, the buildings are scored and another set begins.
At game end, the player with the most fame points.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO395)
Each player tries to be Caesar and then works to prove he is indeed Caesar by collecting fame points. The challenge is to intelligently allocate your eight rolled dice among the five buildings to acquire the fame you need to win the game. Clever Caesar would use these resources to conquer new provinces and assign suitable patricians to them, adding to his already enormous fame. Can you do the same? You will also need to show diplomacy in the senate and maybe visit the temple for some luck from Fortuna to win. Although dice-rolling is luck-based, the options offered here go well beyond luck. You cannot control (well, sometimes you can, actually) the dice you get, but clever allocation of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; dice rolls can yield good results. When the dice allocation is done, the buildings are scored and another set begins. At game end, the player with the most fame points. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO395)
Each player tries to be Caesar and then works to prove he is indeed Caesar by collecting fame points. The challenge is to intelligently allocate your eight rolled dice among the five buildings to acquire the fame you need to win the game. Clever Caesar would use these resources to conquer new provinces and assign suitable patricians to them, adding to his already enormous fame. Can you do the same? You will also need to show diplomacy in the senate and maybe visit the temple for some luck from Fortuna to win. Although dice-rolling is luck-based, the options offered here go well beyond luck. You cannot control (well, sometimes you can, actually) the dice you get, but clever allocation of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bad_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; dice rolls can yield good results. When the dice allocation is done, the buildings are scored and another set begins. At game end, the player with the most fame points.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of the game has been played four times.
All game playing components are present (dice, the many counters, rules and Senate Card Summary Sheet).
All components are still in pretty good condition after all of these years.  The counters still look pretty good.  Dice are still in great shape.  The items in the worse shape are probably the rules and single page Senate Card Summary Sheet.  It is obvious that those have been looked through many times.
I still have the awful game insert.
The game box is also in pretty good condition after all of these years.  The box top is starting to flare along the long edges.  The box corners are starting to show wear and tear as well as the edges along the box bottom.
Game comes from non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, full prices after an order but ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.
On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>

Alea Iacta Est is Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Die is Cast_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Players take on the role of Caesar and compete for the most prestige points. This happens by clever placement of his/her eight dice, which are placed on five different buildings.
At the Castrum (barracks), new provinces can be conquered, while patricians can be recruited at the Forum Romanum to be sent to those provinces. At the Senatus, cards can be won for bonuses that will be kept secret until the end of the game. The Templum awards prestige points directly from the Goddess Fortuna. Each die that does not win any of these ends the round at the Latrina, where it provides its owner with a “repete!” chip, which can be used to re-roll dice or can be traded in two-to-one for prestige points at the end of the game. Each building has special rules as to how the dice can be placed, allowing many tactical possibilities with any roll of the dice.
Each round ends when one player has placed his/her last die, and after 5 rounds (6 rounds with 2-3 players), the patricians are organized in their provinces, the senate cards are revealed, and the scores are totaled. The player with the most prestige points wins!</notes>
