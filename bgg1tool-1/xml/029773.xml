   <description>The push-your-luck game Cheeky Monkey includes eight sets of animals _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; three elephants, four seals, and so on up to ten monkeys _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; with a plastic chip representing each animal. To start the game, you place all the chips in a bag._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On a turn, a player may draw chips until either (1) he chooses to stop or (2) he draws an animal that he has lying in front of him from a previous draw this turn. In this latter case, he returns all chips in front of him from the current turn to the bag, and the next player then takes his turn. In the former case, he stacks the chips in whatever order he wants on top of any chips he's collected in previous turns. (If a player has animals of only a single type, he can tuck them on the bottom of his stack.) Two special rules come into play while the player draws chips:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     If a player draws an animal chip that matches the animal on top of an opponent's stack, the player can steal this animal, adding it to the chips currently in front of him. (If he busts for drawing a duplicate animal, this stolen chip is also returned to the bag.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     If a player draws a monkey, he can either keep the monkey (as with any other animal) or he can swap the monkey for the chip on top of an opponent's stack._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When the last chip has been added to a stack, the game ends. Any player who has more chips of an animal type than any other player receives bonus points equal to the total number of that animal in the game. The player with the most points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Reiner Knizia already created one great push-your-luck game in Circus Flohcati, and Cheeky Monkey might be that games equal in terms of simplicity, enjoyment and style. The game comes with 52 animal tokens (ten monkeys, nine of another animal, and so on down to three of the rarest animal) and ten animal tiles, which are used only for the endgame scoring. FUN!</notes>

It’s a zoo in here! Those meddling monkeys have set all the animals loose, but do you want to catch a pod of walruses, a journey of giraffes, or a zeal of zebras? You can draw as many chips as you want, but don’t be too cheeky! Cheeky Monkeys is hours of fun for everyone from wise old elephants to young pups.Cheeky Monkey is a push your luck style of game where you can interact with the other players at the same time. The back side of the bonus chips gives information such as range of the animals, types of food and more. A great fast paced game for both children and adults. </notes>

Cheeky Monkey provides barrels of fun for all ages as players challenge each other to push their luck to the limit while trying to amass the most valuable collection of wild animals. You can draw as many chips as you want from the plush _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Cheeky Monkey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; bag, but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be too _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cheeky_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; or you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find yourself returning your current catch to the bag! There are 8 different animal chips with distribution from 3 elephants to 10 monkeys creating some nice basic probability and statistics that children catch on to quickly. This adds a nice challenge for adults too. Opportunities exist to steal the top chips from your opponents; adding some fun and hilarity without being too mean, so be careful how you organize your animal stack. Each of the 8 animal bonus disks have a map on the back showing the main habitat of that particular species as well as some good basic facts geared to the younger players interested in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Cheeky Monkey_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; menagerie. </notes>
