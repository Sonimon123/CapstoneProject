   <description>Together, the players use cards to try to build the eight wonders of the ancient world. The number they build varies, but can't be more than seven. (Hence the subtitle of the game, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;...or why the eighth wonder was never built._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;) While building together, each tries to provide the majority of the components for each wonder and collect scoring disks (in four suits). When it's someone else turn, you offer cards to the active player, and by good offers, can earn points (or sometimes even the disk).  So a feature of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Tower of Babel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; is that players always perform actions and can earn points during another's turn. Card trade offers, collecting disk sets, and building wonders are the three ways to earn victory points. The game ends when a player takes the last disk of any one of the four suits, so players have some influence on the game's end moment.  And, the victory points determine the winner at game end. Typical game length is less than an hour._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Reiner Knizia Variant--some recommend against using the action cards because the publisher rather than Reiner Knizia added them and because they damage the game balance. To play with this variant, simply leave the action cards in the box. There is no bonus to the person who completes the final stage of a wonder._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The game is complete.  It was only played a couple of times.  I love this game, and the only reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it is because I have 2 copies.  I am selling the one that is in very good condition, and keeping the one that is in good condition.
I prefer to ship via UPS for tracking reasons, so shipping will vary depending on the destination. The package will be well packed.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting this for sale a little low because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to reduce my collection in prepration for my move. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting more games soon, so keep a eye out for those as well.

Together, the players use cards to try to build the eight wonders of the ancient world. The number they build varies, but can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be more than seven. (Hence the subtitle of the game, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;...or why the eighth wonder was never built._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) While building together, each tries to provide the majority of the components for each wonder and collect scoring disks (in four suits). When it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s someone else turn, you offer cards to the active player, and by good offers, can earn points (or sometimes even the disk). So a feature of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Tower of Babel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is that players always perform actions and can earn points during another_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s turn. Card trade offers, collecting disk sets, and building wonders are the three ways to earn victory points.</notes>
