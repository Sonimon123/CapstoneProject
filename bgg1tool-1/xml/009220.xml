   <description>Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

You are dwarves digging for gold in the depths of a mine when suddenly, the pick-axe breaks, and the lantern goes out. The saboteur has struck again! But who is the saboteur and will he (or they!) stop you from reaching the treasure? If you succeed, gold awaits you. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, then to the victor goes the spoils. Whoever has the most gold nuggets after three rounds is the winner.
A 3-10 player path-laying card game where each player has a role and no one knows for sure what that role is.
Contents: 110 cards
No. of players: 3-10
Ages: 8+

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4026)
You are dwarves digging for gold in the depths of a mine when suddenly, the pick-axe breaks, and the lantern goes out. The saboteur has struck again! But who is the saboteur and will he (or they!) stop you from reaching the treasure? If you succeed, gold awaits you. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, then to the victor goes the spoils. Whoever has the most gold nuggets after three rounds is the winner.
A 3-10 player path-laying card game where each player has a role and no one knows for sure what that role is.

    <notes>Great condition on this game (I received it as part of a trade but never played it myself). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve inventoried all the cards and checked them for damage and wear. It looks like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been played a handful of times, and the box is in similarly great condition.
I prefer Paypal or Amazon.com Payments, pack securely, and ship via USPS parcel post. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking $6 to ship and will refund any difference over $2.</notes>

You are dwarves digging for gold in the depths of a mine when suddenly, the pick-axe breaks, and the lantern goes out. The saboteur has struck again! But who is the saboteur and will he (or they!) stop you from reaching the treasure? If you succeed, gold awaits you. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, then to the victor goes the spoils. Whoever has the most gold nuggets after three rounds is the winner. 
A 3-10 player path-laying card game where each player has a role and no one knows for sure what that role is. </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG4026)
You are dwarves digging for gold in the depths of a mine when suddenly, the pick-axe breaks, and the lantern goes out. The saboteur has struck again! But who is the saboteur and will he (or they!) stop you from reaching the treasure? If you succeed, gold awaits you. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, then to the victor goes the spoils. Whoever has the most gold nuggets after three rounds is the winner. A 3-10 player path-laying card game where each player has a role and no one knows for sure what that role is.</notes>

Please do not purchase if you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t win this auction.
- Games are shipped via USPS Priority Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise, at which point we can discuss shipping. 
- I exclusively use PayPal and PayPal invoices. Please do not pay me until I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sent you an invoice. 
This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail.
