   <description>Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;master strike_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; then the players all lose._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>A brand new, sealed copy of Marvel Legendary. Held in stock in the UK and waiting to be shipped to you! This game is not widely available since it has not been officially released in the UK.
Delivery costs are £7.00 in the UK and can be delivered to your door (using a courier) or to your nearest collect+ store. Payment is either by PayPal or bank transfer. Shipping to Europe costs about £20-30 - if you know of a cheaper service just let me know!
If you have any questions drop me a line. Despatch will normally be within 24 hours of payment but note that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m on holiday in the middle of July so get your order in before then!

Game consists of nearly 600 cards, Full color Game board _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Color Rule Book Like the Avengers or X-Men, players build their own super-team of spectacular Marvel superheroes, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk, and Thor! Players create their own powerful combos on the fly, combining their heroes awesome abilities to take down nasty Marvel super villains like Venom and Mystique. Over the course of the game, recruit increasingly powerful Hero cards to add to your deck, building a stronger and stronger deck of the ultimate Marvel Superhero combinations. Easy to learn, with fast-paced gameplay. Features incredible original artwork of Marvel heroes and villains. Innovative _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Mastermind_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mechanics allow the game itself to fight back against the players: If players aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t careful, villainous Marvel masterminds like Magneto, Loki, and Dr. Doom threaten to accomplish dark schemes and defeat all the players at once! </notes>

Over the course of the game, recruit increasingly powerful Hero cards to add to your deck, building a stronger and stronger deck of the ultimate Marvel Superhero combinations.

The only reason i have selected very good is that there is a tiny nick in the bottom of the board. i have seen other users affected by this. Nothing is noticeable when the board is in play and is barely noticeable from the back of the board. Very good condition game. Played 10-20 times.

    <notes>Legendary bundle includes the Base game, plus Dark City, Fantastic Four and Paint the Town Red expansions.  All cards are sleeved and the sleeves are included in the price. Also included is the neoprene game mat to replace the game board. its much smaller and a way better surface for cards. Never found one in the UK so imported it from America.
Only the base game box and the paint the town red box are included as the cards for the other two expansions fit in the main box when sleeved. 
I am selling off more than half of my collection over the next few weeks. If you are interested in something ask. I might just sell it.
Will ship to UK only.
Shipping via Myhermes direct to your door including tracking, £10. (sorry, this is very heavy)

    <notes>Up for sale is my copy of Legendary base game and Legendary: Dark City Expansion. I am down sizing my game collection and this game did not make the cut. It is a fun game but just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see the table as much as I would like for my game group and I would rather have someone else enjoy it than for it to just sit on my shelf. I take pride in caring for my games and this game only has two plays! All cards are sorted and divided with labels. All my games come from a smoke free home. 
Included in this sale is the following:
Legendary base game
Legendary: Dark City Expansion
Broken Token game organizer

    <notes>This sale is for Legendary, including the Dark City and Fantastic Four expansions. All of the cards are organized in the Legendary base set box. I can include the Dark City box upon request, but sadly I no longer have the Fantastic Four box. The Legendary box has a few scuffs and some minor wear. The cards  were all sleeved in KMC hyper mat sleeves during play, so they have little/no wear(except for one Wound card, which was already damaged when I opened the game new).</notes>

Legendary
Legendary Villains
Legendary Fantastic 4
Legendary Dark City
Legendary Guardians of the Galaxy
Legendary Paint the Town Red
This all comes in the Legendary Villains Box (no other boxes). And includes the mat. I am an OCD organizer. I barely played the base game, and never played the expansions. So its in near mint condition. I have printed over a hundred nice quality dividers, and everything is organized except Guardians (the print files werent available when I organized).
So its a nice box.
Located in Los Angeles: Pasadena Area, but work in glendale and often travel to westside. So can do any reasonable Los Angeles drop off (dont mind driving, I have my audiobooks) Otherwise would work out shipping.
Not sure a fair price, but lets say $110, which seems about 30% off of amazon price for buying all of these.
Willing to negotiate.
Also willing to include Firefly, Big Trouble or the Encounters Alien if you are just interesting in picking up a lot of legendary. Just message me.</notes>

I won these in a local tournament, but have since decided I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not really interested in the game.

    <notes>This is for a wonderfully pimped copy of Legendary: MARVEL. It contains:
The base game
The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Paint The Town Red_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Small Box Expansion
The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Dark City_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Big Box Expansion
A Custom Playmat! (I will include a MonsterTube for an additional $5)
Broken Token Wooden Insert
Labeled Dividers
All cards sleeved in Blue UltraPro Matte sleeves (included with some extras in case of sleeve breakage). All cards were sleeved prior to play so there is literally zero wear on the cards. 
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 9.25 pounds (without the Playmat Tube) so figure an extra pound or so of packing material.
P.S. I am not interested in breaking this set up. I am only looking to unload the set all together. Too often a mis-sort can lead to problems so I would prefer to just do this as a complete lot.</notes>
