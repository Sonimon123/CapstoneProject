    <notes>Very good condition. Includes some component upgrades:
1. The tile boats have been replaced with wooden boats.
2. Meeples of all the suspect colors have been added.  Use the meeples at the start of the game, they represent characters that have not been eliminated.  Once a character is eliminated, switch it to the character disc that comes with the game.  This makes looking at the board and which characters have been eliminated MUCH easier than just flipping the discs over to their black and white side.
The box has some minor wear and whitening.  One corner has a very small (maybe 1/4 inch) crease.  Box is not dishing at all and structurally in excellent condition.</notes>
