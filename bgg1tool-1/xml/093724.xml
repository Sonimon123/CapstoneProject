If the games turn out to be nearly identical, the two entries will be merged in the future. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash;WEM_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The year is 1922 and the Texas Oil Boom is in full swing. Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s train reaches the last track._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGVA67)
The year is 1922 and the Texas Oil Boom is in full swing. Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd Yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas. </notes>

Payment via PayPal, or cash for local pickup.
Buyer pays actual shipping from the 65536 zip code. I will work with you to minimize shipping costs and combine shipping wherever possible. I prefer USPS fixed rate priority boxes, which usually means $12.35 for a medium box.
Please check out my other games for sale. I recently added a bunch of GMT war games and other classic boardgames. </notes>

    <notes>by Fantasy Flight. If you purchase mulitple games, I am willing to ship them out together to save on shipping costs.
All products are as described. If you have questions, please let me know.
Please take a look at all the games I have for sale. If you purchase multiple games, I am willing to ship them out together to save on shipping costs.
For international orders, I will only ship via Priority International Mail via US Postal Service. While more expensive, it allows for quicker, more reliable delivery and also includes insurance. Other shipping methods are cheaper, but unreliable in many parts of the world, after it leaves the US Postal Service.
Thanks for your consideration.

Please do not purchase if you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t win this auction.
- Games are shipped via USPS Priority Mail unless the buyer requests otherwise, at which point we can discuss shipping. 
- I exclusively use PayPal and PayPal invoices. Please do not pay me until I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sent you an invoice. 
This is a useful rundown of how this process works, for those who haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bought from many auctions before:
1. You start the process by adding the item to the cart and checking out on BGG. This is your way of saying you want to buy the item.
2. I price out shipping
3. Once the order is confirmed, I send you a PayPal invoice that lists what you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying and how much shipping is.
4. You pay the invoice.
5. I purchase shipping, send you a tracking number, and put it in the mail.
