   <description>From publisher website:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the Horus Heresy board game, the most legendary battle in the history of the Warhammer 40,000 universe unfolds across the razed plains of Terra and in the frozen orbit above. Deadly fighting ranges from the Emperor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s golden Inner Palace to Horus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s flagship, the Vengeful Spirit._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Taking the side of traitor or loyalist, two players control either fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies both loyal and traitorous, and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;An innovative order and initiative system forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops. A dramatic, card-driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This legendary tale of treachery and heroism is brought to vibrant life with over one hundred magnificent sculpted plastic playing pieces. The stunning three-dimensional map of Terra brilliantly portrays the landscape immediately surrounding the Imperial Palace, from the magma-filled crevasses to the fortifications that offer the Imperial player protection against both enemy assault and orbital bombardments._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each one of these structures, as well as the Imperial Palace itself, have been expertly sculpted, and rise above the landscape to create a truly immersive experience. The fortifications of Terra have never looked more formidable! Once the board is set up with playing pieces and terrain for your first game, it will be a wonder to behold._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Horus Heresy includes six scenarios that differ in both difficulty and style. The first scenario, titled Brother Against Brother, is recommended for all new players as it provides predetermined starting locations for both player's forces. It is a well balanced version of the Battle for Terra, and also presents a roughly historical recreation of the conflict's events._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Horus Heresy is a board game that pits two players against each other to recreate the most famous battle of Warhammer 40,000_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s rich history, in which the Warmaster Horus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s betrayal of the Emperor comes to its climax. Taking the side of either traitor or loyalist, players control a fearsome array of units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves. Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Not to be confused with Horus Heresy (1993), the original 1993 Games Workshop game of the same name._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG GW02)
On the thirteenth day of Secundus, the bombardment began...
In the greatest betrayal the universe has ever known, the Warmaster Horus - once humanity’s greatest general, now corrupted by Chaos - has turned against the Emperor and hurled the Imperium of Man into ferocious civil war. The galactic conflict has risen to its climax. The Warmaster’s ruinous legions have assaulted Holy Terra itself, the Emperor’s seat. Here the fate of humanity hangs in the balance during the greatest military campaign ever seen.
In the Horus Heresy board game, this legendary battle unfolds across the razed plains of Terra and in the frozen orbit above. Deadly fighting ranges from the Emperor’s golden Inner Palace to Horus’s flagship, the Vengeful Spirit. Taking the side of either traitor or loyalist, two players control either fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies both loyal and traitorous, and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves.
An innovative order and initiative system forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops. A dramatic, card driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos. Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!
Horus Heresy includes over 120 detailed miniature models including 10 plastic terrain pieces, and more than 200 cards to bring this sweeping conflict to life on a stunning map of the war-torn Terra.

    <notes>We over-ordered Horus Heresy, so now I have 3 extra copies that would like to find good gamer homes.
I can either ship via USPS Priority @ $25.00 or USPS Parcel Post @ $15.00 - your choice!  USPS Insurance will cost an extra $2.25.  PA sales require an additional 6% sales tax.
I will certainly look to combine and lessen shipping costs for multiple copies if we can.  Let me know if you want more than one copy and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll create additional marketplace items just for you so that BGG get_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s their cut!</notes>

    <notes>This game has only been played a couple of times and is in great condition.  There is even a replacement board from FFG due to the board warping.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a coffin box game so there is some minor shelf wear and a few minor imperfections in the box.  Nothing major and nothing you can really see with your eye.
I accept paypal payments only.  I will ship upon receipt of payment.  
This is a large game. Shipping will be via UPS or Fed Ex Ground at my discretion.  Shipping will be $15.00 due to the size and weight.</notes>

    <notes>Prefer pickup in Sydney as it is quite a big box. Will investigate postage to Australia if somebody really wants it.
In very good condition - only played a couple of times but its time to down size now (and its a big box). 
I have checked every single piece of the game is present and in good condition. 
The only thing of note is that the game came with one too many Khorne (Red) Chaos Cultists and one too few Khorne Chaos Warband. This is not a problem as the two sculpts look almost identical anyway, you normally just use the rank on the bases (which are separate to the sculpt) to differentiate all the cultists from warband anyway (and the game did come with the correct number of bases). So I never bothered to contact FFG to get another Chaos Warband figure. I do however have the proof of purchase token which should allow you to do that if you choose to. </notes>

    <notes>Horus Heresy is in great condition, played for about half an hour total. However, the game is missing one (of the 112) miniatures (an adeptus arbites to be specific), but this doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay because you can utilize the base without the miniature to represent the unit.

    <notes>CONDITION - The game is new and still in the shrinkwrap! This seems like the perfect time to sell (and for someone to buy) a big, heavy game as there would be no expensive shipping costs this way.
*****NOTE: This game was sold to (Silverburg) on the BGG VFM for 2013 and will be delivered to the Con for cash payment there.*****</notes>

    <notes>Description: 
In the greatest betrayal the universe has ever known, the Warmaster Horus, once humanity’s greatest general and now corrupted by Chaos, has turned against the Emperor and hurled the Imperium of Man into ferocious civil war. The galactic conflict has risen to its climax and the fate of humanity hangs in the balance during the greatest military campaign ever seen.
In the Horus Heresy board game, this legendary battle unfolds across the razed plains of Terra and in the frozen orbit above. Deadly fighting ranges from the Emperor’s golden Inner Palace to Horus’s flagship, the Vengeful Spirit. Taking the side of either traitor or loyalist, two players may control fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies, both loyal and traitorous and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves.
The innovative order and initiative system of Horus Heresy forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops. A dramatic, card driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos. Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!
Horus Heresy includes over 120 detailed miniature models, including 10 plastic terrain pieces and more than 200 cards bringing this sweeping conflict to life on a stunning map of war-torn Terra.
 
Not to be confused with Horus Heresy, the original 1993 Games Workshop game of the same name.

I ship daily and will ship your item the next day after receiving payment. I will only charge you the actual cost of shipping. Most normal size games fit in a flat rate box and ship for $12, while some larger items may cost more. Some very small games will cost less. I will ship worldwide, but understand that shipping packages outside of the United States is very expensive. Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>Ich verkaufe hier das Brettspiel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Horus Heresy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; aus dem Warhammer 40.000-Universum.

Die Spielfiguren wurden in extra Kunststoffboxen aufbewahrt um Beschädigungen vorzubeugen.
Weitere Informationen über das Spiel kann man hier erhalten:
