   <description>In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.  The game itself is beautifully put together, with a detailed hex grid and real metal miniatures for all of the units._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Online Play: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Full Metal Galaxy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Full Metal Program_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    VASSAL module_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Full Metal Conquête (as a two-player version)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Full Metal Planete: Plateau Modulaire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Microbadges:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; - Full Metal Plan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;egrave;te fan  Buy It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This copy is BRAND NEW still in its original shrink, most probably one of the last copies on earth, making this the ultimate collector item, the holy grail for every gamer. One of the small sides of the box was slightly damaged (barely noticeable, you should not worry about this), game is otherwise absolutely new as if you had bought it ten minutes ago at the local store !!!
Recomended shipping method for this jewel is airmail + insurance and tracking number. Due to its weight this will cost about 40 Euro ($50). Cheaper shipping available, but slower and without insurance.
Payment in Euro preferred for this item but if you really want to pay with US dollars, an agreement can certainly be found.</notes>

    <notes>If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for the game you know it is cult:
4 players, 3 minutes per turn, one astronef for each player and enough material to compete with your rivals to collect most of the ore.
With fascinating metal pieces for each player.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for replacement armies, simply let me know.
The game is located in germany. Alas, german post (or it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s carrier DHL) wants to see huge sums for shipping. These are: 
6,50 Euro within germany 
18,- Euro within europe
33,- Euro to USA
38,- Euro the rest of the world

    <notes>I was a boardgame collector in the Eighties, but have not played in the last fifteen years. I never bought used items, I only bought them new in the shop. I have played FULL METAL PLANET a few times (20-30) in the Eighties, but was very very carefully. All items are still included, there are even much more coloured markers and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;stones_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. The board is MINT as are the rulebook and the rest. A copy of German rules (translated) is also included. The only signs of the age are some small white lines at the edges of the box (front and rear), but a game in the shop will this get after a while too. Shipping: Germany 6 Euro. EU in Europe: 17 Euro. Rest of Europe: 30 Euro. USA, Canada: 35 Euro. Rest of the World: 40 Euro. International Paying per PayPal, in Europe and Germany bank transfer too - auch per Überweisung. Perfekt erhaltene Ausgabe von FULL METAL PLANET mit allen Bestandteilen plus deutscher Übersetzung der Regeln. Wurde von mir damals neu im Laden gekauft und selbst beim Spielen wie ein rohes Ei behandelt. Spielbrett deshalb nch immer in Top-Zustand!!! Box sehr gut erhalten, aber altersbedingt schmale weiße _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Blitzkanten_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; an den Rändern. Sonst alles, als wäre es eben NEU gekauft worden!</notes>

Yes, you read it correctly, this is a new copy.
My guess  is that there are less than a handful new copies to be found worldwide of this gem.
Only the shrinkwrap has been removed.
This is your chance to get hold of this classic.</notes>

    <notes>*Reserved for Bruce*
This is a one-of-a-kind edition of this game.  I bought it new, it includes the expansion and it is new, and it is in a custom-made wood box with a lid that is a shiny surface with the image of the game box.  There is a custom-made wood piece made for the game that I am sure I would know what it is if I had ever played the game.  The game has never been played.  When I bought it, my kids were too young to play it.  Nobody ever seemed interested, and now it is just my husband and me playing games.  In my opinion, this game needs more than 2-players.  The wooden box measures approximately 21_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 13 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  There are individual compartments with wood dividers.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>
