       <name primary="true" sortindex="1">Rise of the Luftwaffe</name>
         
   <description>Rise of the Luftwaffe is the first in Down in Flames series of card games that simulate WW2 air combat. Each player has a hand of maneuver cards which he uses to improve his position relative to an enemy plane or fire on the enemy. The opponent is allowed to counter the maneuver by playing cards of his own, to which original player can counter back, etc. The last player to play a card determines whether the original action occurs or not._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each plane is rated with horsepower (which indicates how many card you can draw), performance (how many cards to be held), burst (the values of fire cards that can be played), etc. The number of cards in your hand abstractly represents the momentum of each aircraft._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A dogfight lasts a mere 6 turns and take about 15 minutes to play. There are also campaign games which represent a number of interconnected missions and various operations the players can take. A campaign can take about 2-3 hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>RISE OF THE LUFTWAFFE Condition: The game is complete and in excellent condition, no creases or folds on cards, rulebook, player aids, etc. Some counters are cut from countersheet.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a tiny nick on the edge of the top box. 
If you buy my copy of the expansion Eight Air Force as well (also like new, $18, see marketplace). I will reduce the cost of the combined two game package by $5 (i.e., $49 for both games).
SHIPPING: Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, the check will need to clear first before I will ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace. </notes>

    <notes>This game is out-of-print. Box is in good condition, no split corners. Does have some cupping to the top and one corner is crunched a little. All components are there including the campaign game, counters unpunched. I played around with it a little, but never played a game with anyone so cards are excellent. A fun game that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not eager to part with, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve got too many fun games and I need the cash more than the game.</notes>

    <notes>This game was never played.  The counters are unpunched.  However, the first three pages of the rules have been  highlighted and/or underlined.   The rules are fully legible, but are a little messy in some sections.  You will not need another copy of them to play the game.  The box cover is somewhat bowed out.  
I have photos, but was unable to upload photos using the new system used by the Marketplace.  Please email me if you would like to see photos of this item.   Thank you.
I would usually ship the game by using a Priority Mail flat rate box at a cost of $13.60.  Thank you.</notes>
