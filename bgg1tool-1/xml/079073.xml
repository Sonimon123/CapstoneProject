   <description>In Resident Evil, a deadly virus has caused the dead to rise and infect any living thing they encounter!  Fleeing to a mysterious mansion, you must gather any materials you can find to protect yourself and fight for your survival against a legion of infected beings!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Resident Evil DBG brings the story to life in a game of strategy where players construct their card decks while they play.  Choose one of your favorite characters from Resident Evil such as: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, or Albert Wesker among others. Players start with only the most basic of items and weapons. As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected!  Your deck will be your lifeline to survival.  How will you survive the zombie outbreak?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Resident Evil DBG will consist of 250 playing cards, 3 different game modes (Story, Mercenary and Versus) and hundreds of possible scenarios within each mode for unlimited replay value.  No two games will ever be the same!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Story mode is the main version of the game where players must race to claim the best weapons, items, and ammunition before others get to it first. Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Versus mode removes the Infected from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as the Infected!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players take on the role of one of the Heroes of Resident Evil. They start with a deck of 10 cards, which consist of Weapons and Ammo. Players must use their resources to obtain more powerful Weapons, Ammo, Items, and Action Cards that they add to their deck. As you progress in the game your Deck will become stronger and more efficient. You must use the cards in your deck to fight the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Infected_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; creatures which awards you Decorations . To win the game you must defeat more _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Infected_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; creatures then your opponents, but the game only ends when the strongest _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Infected_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; creatures is killed. Once he is killed, the player that has gained the most Decorations wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Ammo cards are used to power your Weapons as well as purchase new cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Weapon cards are used to battle the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Infected_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; creatures. Stronger weapons require more ammo._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Item cards allow you to strengthen and Heal your Character._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Action cards give you additional actions that you can take during your turn, such as drawing more cards or improving the power of your weapons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game Contents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     250 Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Game Manual_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Integrates with:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Alliance_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Mercenaries_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Outbreak_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Nightmare_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

In Resident Evil, a deadly virus has caused the dead to rise and infect any living thing they encounter! Fleeing to a mysterious mansion, you must gather any materials you can find to protect yourself and fight for your survival against a legion of infected beings!
The Resident Evil DBG brings the story to life in a game of strategy where players construct their card decks while they play. Choose one of your favorite characters from Resident Evil such as: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, or Albert Wesker among others. Players start with only the most basic of items and weapons. As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected! Your deck will be your lifeline to survival. How will you survive the zombie outbreak?</notes>

Box has a dent in the bottom but cards are pretty much perfect.  I say pretty much because there is some spontaneous warping of certain cards due to the generally poor card quality of the cards.  Check the forums for more information on what I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m talking about.  
The cards have been very well cared for and the game has only been played a handful of times.  There are no creases or signs of having been handled.
I will only ship this item via USPS Priority Mail.
However, if you are in the the Boston area or metro-west or metro-south areas of MA you can pick the game up.

    <notes>(This includes the original Resident Evil game (this entry), the Alliance expansion, and the Chris/Jill foil promos)
OK, I may or may not have been crazy when I decided to toss the box for Alliance, and the insert for this game, and combine everything into one box.  I have put every set of cards into one sleeve to help organize everything.
So what you get is every card from both games, both rulebooks, etc, all for one low price.  What you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get is the box for Alliance and the plastic inserts.  The picture might help (I purposely spread things out to show detail, but there is tons of room in the box for more cards from future expansions).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

I believe the game may be out of print.
All cards sleeved.  Love Resident Evil and the artwork on the cards but I have no one to play it with anymore.  Played once or twice.
Currently they are all stored in the Nightmare expansion box (as it is large enough to store all).  I can quote freight with or without the other two games boxes as required.  Would prefer to sell as a bunch as sorting them back into the original boxes will be time consuming (over 600 cards) but will do if required.
 just message for an individual price.
Will also accept Bank Transfer.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling the Resident Evil Deck Building Game collection I have which consists of the following;
The original base game, Alliance, Outbreak, Nightmare, and Mercenaries.
I have the whole game sleeved and stored inside the Nightmare box.  I no longer have the other 4 boxes.  The only cards not sleeved are the extra copies of the basic cards (ammo, herbs, etc).  Everything is otherwise complete, including all the manuals and tokens.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship it anywhere in the world, at its cost via Canada Post, in addition to the $50 for the game.
If you live in the Toronto area, I can always meet in person to eliminate the shipping cost.
Contact me if you require any further information.</notes>
