   <description>Each player controls colored mice and tries to collect pieces of cheese in Castle Appenzell. On their turn, players spend action points to put new mice into play, reveal corridors in the castle, move their mice around the castle, or push a tile into play, which changes the maze of cheese pieces underneath. If two of a single player's mice reach a place with the same kind of cheese showing, the player obtains a piece of this cheese. The first player with 4 different pieces of cheese wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Game Description: Monsieur de Montforte no longer lives in his Chateau. When he vacated the premises, the highly acclaimed gourmet left behind a collection of the finest cheeses in the world. As the years passed, the cheese aged, but so did the Chateau. Now the mice that search the Chateau for the cheese treasures must be careful or fall into holes which have opened in the floors as the building aged, making the Chateau one of the largest mouse traps under the starlit sky.Welcome to the craziest Chateau in the gaming world! The three-dimensional adventure takes place on four levels. At the top, the Chateau’s roof blocks the view of the inside. When a player peeks under the roof, he can see the lattice of walls and rooms and send his mice in search of treasure – cheese! However, once there, the mice must tread carefully as the floors slide unexpectedly under their paws and can reveal a deadly trap. For those who can avoid the traps, delicious cheese treasures await.Not only can children shine in Chateau Roquefort with their unbeatable memories, but they improve also their abilities to anticipate what lies ahead! Adults will also find the game an exciting challenge, again and again! it And the game comes with a two-sided board for TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS!

As the years passed, the cheese aged, but so did the Chateau. Now the mice that search the Chateau for the cheese treasures must be careful or fall into holes which have opened in the floors as the building aged, making the Chateau one of the largest mouse traps under the starlit sky.Welcome to the craziest Chateau in the gaming world! The three-dimensional adventure takes place on four levels. At the top, the Chateau’s roof blocks the view of the inside. When a player peeks under the roof, he can see the lattice of walls and rooms and send his mice in search of treasure – cheese! However, once there, the mice must tread carefully as the floors slide unexpectedly under their paws and can reveal a deadly trap. For those who can avoid the traps, delicious cheese treasures await.Not only can children shine in Chateau Roquefort with their unbeatable memories, but they improve also their abilities to anticipate what lies ahead! Adults will also find the game an exciting challenge, again and again! it And the game comes with a two-sided board for TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS!

On their turn, players spend action points to put new mice into play, reveal corridors in the castle, move their mice around the castle, or push a tile into play, which changes the maze of cheese pieces underneath. If two of a single player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mice reach a place with the same kind of cheese showing, the player obtains a piece of this cheese. The first player with 4 different pieces of cheese wins the game.

    <notes>Game is in very good condition, but is missing one collecting tile.  This should not impact game play as these are just used to keep track of meeting the game winning condition.
Two of the stone shoving tiles were lost and replaced with cardboard pieces of the exact same size.

    <notes>If it were not for three missing cheese pieces the game would count as very good condition. The missing pieces are used to keep _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;score_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, they do not interfere with the running of the game and could easily be substituted with a token (and will not even come into play in many games).
The game is a fun childrens game involving some cleverness and memory. We liked it a lot, but our main audience has grown beyond the game now. I hope you get as much fun out of it as we did.

    <notes>Only played one time.  We don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have kids.  Great game (amazing design), but I am willing to sell since the value is there right now and we don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have children that come to our gaming groups any longer to play this wonderful game with us.  Box is in perfect condition as are the pieces, which are all there.  Instructions are also in perfect condition.  Can send picture if desired.

I will ship from Germany and I am willing to ship anywhere.
Please ask me, for the shipping costs for your land.
I will charge shipping at cost. Everything will be well packed.
You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.
If you buy more games, then I make all in one package!
We have a large private collection of games. Due to space and time constraints we must rid ourselves of some of the games. Therefore, these are private sales.</notes>
