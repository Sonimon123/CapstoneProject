   <description>Band of Heroes is a tactical board game tour de force that covers the battles of America's airborne troops during June of 1944. Band of Heroes includes a bucket full of new weapons, squads, and vehicles, including U.S. Airborne, German SS, and Fallschirmjager troops, Tiger, Sherman, Stuart, and PzIIIJ tanks, and MG42, MG34, and M1919A4 machine guns.  But the scenarios are the selling point, and this batch of sixteen tells the story of the men from the 101st and 82nd Airborne Division's fighting the Germans in the Norman hedgerows during June of 1944._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Components_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     6 mounted maps_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     480+ beautiful counters, counters, representing the men and equipment from the 82nd, 101st, 17th SS Panzergrenadier, 6th Fallschirmjager, 91st Airlanding, and 352nd Infantry Divisions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     16 Skill Cards, providing Leaders and Heroes with special abilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     16 Band of Heroes Scenarios_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expansions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load Tactical: Battle Pack Alpha_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load Tactical: Battle Pack Bravo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load: A Ring of Hills _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load: Swift and Bold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load: Not One Step Back_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load Tactical: Dark July 43_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Lock 'n Load: Noville – Bastogne's Outpost_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is no longer available, the new, improved and expanded edition can be found in Lock 'n Load Tactical: Heroes of Normandy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Mark H. Walker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Lock _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Load: Band of Heroes 2nd Edition is the reprint of the Lock _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Load game that returned the award winning tactical combat system to the hedgerows of Normandy. Lock ‘n Load is the game system that features _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;more game and less guff._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Don’t waste hours with convoluted rulebooks cobbled together in the name of realism. Dive right in and play with Lock ‘n Load’s rapid fire impulse system and immersive graphics. Although a squad-based game, single men also make a difference - Leaders, heroes, medics, and even chaplains inspire their men; leading them to feats of heroic bravery. Random events triggered during play add to the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;you -are-there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; feeling. Ambushes spring unannounced, squads panic in unforeseen circumstances, and unexpected air support saves the day. It’s all here, in a game that plays much like a good military adventure novel. 
A Charles S. Roberts award winner, International Gamers Awards Game of the Year, and voted by Game Magazine as one of the top five conflict simulations. Everyone is playing Lock ‘n Load. Shouldn’t you be doing the same?

    <notes>This is the Second Edition of the game. The outer shrink wrap has been removed, but the game has never been played. Some of the counters became punched during shipping when the game was shipped to me brand new. Those counters were carefully bagged, and the rest remain un-punched.

    <notes>Band of Heroes 2nd Edition and Swift and Bold 1st Edition.
The box of Band of Heroes (which contains both games) has a tear on one corner which I have taped, and there is a small crease along one edge. Both of these were present when I puchased the game new a few months ago. I have played a handful of scenarios of BoH, and one of Swift and Bold. As such the components are in very good condition. There are one or two counters where when punching a small amount of the counter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s face came away. It is not a major tear, just a small bit on the bottom corner in each case on the reverse side of the counters, which does not obscure any information.
If you require photos, send me a PM.
Postage only in UK - standard parcel £5.30.

    <notes>For sale is one copy of Band of Heroes, Second Edition, by Lock _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Load Publishing. The shrink wrap has been removed from the box in order to allow me to inspect the components, and the lid of the box is slightly concave, which I think is just the way they made it. Otherwise the game is as new, complete, and in pristine condition. The counters are unpunched, and the maps have never been unfolded. Photos are available on request. 
I can accept payment by PayPal and SEPA bank transfer (SEPA-Überweisung). Shipping is within Europe only, and buyer pays shipping costs, which will be approximately €8 within Germany, and €16 for shipping by tracked DHL post within Europe.
Alternatively, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to trade the game for a copy of any of the following games, in new or like new condition:
- A Victory Lost by MMP
- Storm over Stalingrad by MMP
- Into the Pocket!: Operation Winter Storm by Flying Pig Games/Tiny Battle Publishing
- Into the Bastards!: First tank battle from Battles Magazine
- Corps Command: Totensonntag by Lock _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;n Load Publishing
- Bomber Command by GMT Games</notes>
