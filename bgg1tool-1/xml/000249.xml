   <description>Also known as 'Rette Sich Wer Kann' ('Each Man for Himself') and often times referred to as 'The Lifeboat Game,' this pure negotiation game puts a different spin on the typical ocean catastrophe.  There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon.  However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.  If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7013) 
In uncharted waters, the ship, Santa Timea, has collided with a reef, and the sailors set off in the old lifeboats for a hair-raising journey to sheltering shores. As the lifeboats move closer to the islands, water rushes in and sailors get thrown overboard. But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all done democratically and the majority rules - unless you happen to play the Captain’s Hat at the right time to overrule everyone.
In Lifeboats, players use their cards to vote for which boat moves closer to safety, which boat springs a leak and who gets thrown overboard. Negotiation skills are a must and backstabbing will not be uncommon - after all, you will do whatever is necessary to get your sailors to shore... and so will everyone else!
Originally released as Rette Sich Wer Kann.
Contents: 7 wooden lifeboats, 61 cards, 42 wooden sailors, 15 wooden leak discs, 1 start player token, 1 gameboard.
No. of players: 3-6
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 90 minutes</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7013) 
In uncharted waters, the ship, Santa Timea, has collided with a reef, and the sailors set off in the old lifeboats for a hair-raising journey to sheltering shores. As the lifeboats move closer to the islands, water rushes in and sailors get thrown overboard. But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all done democratically and the majority rules - unless you happen to play the Captain’s Hat at the right time to overrule everyone.
In Lifeboats, players use their cards to vote for which boat moves closer to safety, which boat springs a leak and who gets thrown overboard. Negotiation skills are a must and backstabbing will not be uncommon - after all, you will do whatever is necessary to get your sailors to shore... and so will everyone else!
Originally released as Rette Sich Wer Kann.
Contents: 7 wooden lifeboats, 61 cards, 42 wooden sailors, 15 wooden leak discs, 1 start player token, 1 gameboard.
No. of players: 3-6
Ages: 12+
Playing time: 90 minutes

    <notes>This is the original (and far superior) Walter Müller_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Spielewerkstatt Rette Sich Wer Kann version. Game is in excellent condition.  All the components are present and correct.  The plain card box insert (very flimsy) isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fully intact (although I doubt you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find many examples that are!). The box lid has slight wear around the edges, but nothing serious.

    <notes>Z-Man English edition. Box has a large dent on the bottom that goes through the cardboard at one point and creased the sides of the box top, but is otherwise solid. This dent has also deformed the insert slightly. That is why this game is available at such a fine price! 
Game pieces and board are all in excellent condition and it is complete. Shipping will vary based on location, but you can calculate roughly what it will cost based on a 4lb package from US ZIP 04280. Canadian packages will be shipped via First Class International. 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. Items will be shipped within two days of payment. </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7013)
In uncharted waters, the ship, Santa Timea, has collided with a reef, and the sailors set off in the old lifeboats for a hair-raising journey to sheltering shores. As the lifeboats move closer to the islands, water rushes in and sailors get thrown overboard. But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all done democratically and the majority rules - unless you happen to play the Captain’s Hat at the right time to overrule everyone.
In Lifeboats, players use their cards to vote for which boat moves closer to safety, which boat springs a leak and who gets thrown overboard. Negotiation skills are a must and backstabbing will not be uncommon - after all, you will do whatever is necessary to get your sailors to shore... and so will everyone else!

Description: Used, complete and in great shape.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG7013)
In uncharted waters, the ship, Santa Timea, has collided with a reef, and the sailors set off in the old lifeboats for a hair-raising journey to sheltering shores. As the lifeboats move closer to the islands, water rushes in and sailors get thrown overboard. But it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all done democratically and the majority rules - unless you happen to play the Captain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Hat at the right time to overrule everyone. In Lifeboats, players use their cards to vote for which boat moves closer to safety, which boat springs a leak and who gets thrown overboard. Negotiation skills are a must and backstabbing will not be uncommon - after all, you will do whatever is necessary to get your sailors to shore... and so will everyone else! </notes>

    <notes>Only played once, in excellent condition and everything bagged by player color.
Common manufacturing defect: some of the player discs came stuck inside the boats, and I managed to get all of them out except the red disc out of the white boat. Only _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;problem_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; game-wise is that the red player doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have that tiny disc in front of him to show he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s red.</notes>

IMPORTANT: I have painted the boats with a line for each and have also attached little lego sailor hats. The hats can probably be removed (I used hot glue) without damaging the pieces. The hats are also painted a bit so the brim is black. Please see the photo below for a picture of the game as it is painted.

    <notes>Lifeboats is a hidden voting game where you are pinned against your friends trying to make it to shore. It takes about five minutes to explain, has a good amount of negotiation and game play, and has that ever-so-fun backstabbing element to it that says _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;You shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t of trusted me._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Like all games I am listing, I simply do not find myself playing these games again. They are in good/great condition, well cared for, and I am just looking to sell them quickly and usually at a very low price.
If you have any questions, please ask.</notes>

    <notes>Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags.  I ship via USPS, which is most cost effective.When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. Shipping from 98012.
Here’s some shipping ESTIMATES to help you get an idea of what it will cost. Your distance from my Zip Code (98012) and box weight are the biggest factors in price. Please ask ahead of time if you want to know your shipping! If you place an order and cancel it after I provide you with shipping, you will get negative feedback. 
Small Card Game (i.e. 6 nimmt or Hanabi) $3-$6  / USPS First Class or Priority Bubble Mailer 
Thin Medium Sized  (i.e. Concept, Las Vegas) $8-$10 / Priority Mail
Thick Medium Sized (i.e. Istanbul, King of Tokyo, Russian Railroads) $10-$13 / Priority Mail
Big Box Games (i.e. Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders) $16-$18 / Priority Mail or Parcel Post
Oversized or Odd Shaped Boxes ($22-$25) / Parcel Post</notes>

    <notes>[b]Shipping Options:[/b]
I will check all three of USPS, UPS, and FedEx to find the cheapest option.  Experience has made it clear that there is no one-size fits all shipping solution and each carrier has different favorable price points depending on weight, dimensions, and distance.  Not all options will be available, but may include:
USPS Priority (East Coast)
USPS Retail Ground (Midwest and West Coast)
USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
USPS First Class (Under 13 oz)
UPS Ground
FedEx Home 
FedEx Ground (commercial addresses only)
[b]International Orders:[/b]
I will ship worldwide, but please be aware of the high cost of shipping and possible tax and customs charges.

    <notes>NOTE: This is the ORIGINAL GERMAN edition of this game. 
NOTE: this weighs a bit which will add to the delivery cost.
Not in shrink, some of the tokens were punched before I received my copy. Otherwise, untouched and in excellent condition.
Bought used, played never, put away.
My copy comes with a print out of the English rules.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
Can ship quickly in the UK cheaply by courier.
Can ship quickish to the EU by Royal Mail
Can ship slowly by sea to the USA/Canada by Royal Mail cheaply. If you want airmail, that costs.
Other locations will research when I get an order.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
If you make the Paypal payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If you make the Paypal payment as a commercial transaction, I get charged near 4% of the payment because you get protection in a dispute. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously.</notes>

Buyer to pay UPS shipping (typically $16.95) but once we have your address we will be able to figure the exact amount.
We accept paypal, or mailed checks. Please give this game a good home, and a lot more table time than we were able to ;-)</notes>
