   <description>Neuland is a game about logistics and planning.  In the beginning of the game, the land lies undeveloped, a series of blank hexes representing mountains, forests, and grasslands.  Players win by building and using prestige properties that allow them to place their family's coat-of-arms onto the board -- first to place all their coats of arms wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To use these buildings, though, requires the player have the correct raw materials.  Swords and cloth, for example, or coins and paper.   Each one of these materials needs even more basic materials, such as iron ore, coal, and so on backward toward the most basic elements such as food, wood, and stone._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To cull these materials from the land, one builds buildings -- a Stonecutter's Hut, Smelter, Coin Manufactury, and so on.  Once on the board, buildings can be used by any player, not just the one who built them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A player doesn't collect these resources for safekeeping as in The Settlers of Catan or Keythedral.  Instead, resources claimed via buildings must be used up either in the player's current turn or his next one.  If he doesn't, the resources spoil and are removed from the board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Essentially, the challenge of the game is one of planning logistical supply chains which will allow one to process these resources most efficiently to build the prestige properties the fastest.  Since it's a perfect information game, one can also see what one's opponents are scheming, and place workers to interrupt their supply chains, possibly causing their resources to spoil and making the player start from zero again._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Neuland's most interesting innovation is perhaps its Time Track Mechanism, in which players who take less actions in a turn will have turns more frequently, and can forward-plan in order to take a long turn of nearly twenty actions instead of the ordinary maximum of ten._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Neuland was originally published by Eggert-Spiele in 2004, and republished by Z-man in 2006 with some significant rules changes.  A majority of BGG users seem to strongly prefer the original Eggert-Spiele rules. Also heavily recommended is the rules re-write file available for download here on BGG, for the one that comes with the 2nd edition is nearly incomprehensible._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Z-Man edition.  Only played once, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in great condition.
Shipping will be via USPS from zip 80015, not sure on whether it will fit in a flat rate box ($9.30), but if not, guesstimate using a 4 pound box via either Priority Mail or Parcel Post.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for handling, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure what the final weight will be after packing (at most 5 pounds, I think).

    <notes>Z-Man edition (English). Complete. Components neatly punched and sorted, but the game appears like-new with the only minor wear being a touch of shelf wear to the box. Components still have a bit of the new game smell.
Shipping weight is 3.8lb, and it will fit in a USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate box, for $9.80. The fit is a touch close, though, so if you would prefer FedEx Home Delivery, or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to add insurance, please inquire (FedEx may be slightly cheaper if you live close to California, but for most of the country will be a little more expensive).</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition, fully punched and meticulously bagged.  Despite it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s great rating, I find I hate this game and want it gone.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s stored in the manner of all my games: individual starting player bags to expedite setup, and all components sorted individually as much as possible.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played 5 times.  Please make it a loving home.  I have also included a printout from the Geek explaining the rules in a much more understandable way than the ultra-crappy rulebook (which is also in great shape).</notes>

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

Excellent condition, played gently only a few times in non-smoking home.
SHIPPING:
USA: $10.95 shipping in USA.
MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping! So look at my other games for sale. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game.
MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.
INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance. (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.
Thank you! I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG7025)
Neuland lies undeveloped with only a few hunters and woodcutters living there. Players compete to build up a new civilization in which 15 properties promise prosperity and progress, including the Abbey, Guild House, Town Hall, and Stronghold. Who will achieve the chains of production necessary to claim each cultural building? Players must evaluate how much to do each turn since the fewer actions they take, the more they can achieve the next turn. When should you make your big move so you can claim that cultural advance with your coat of arms? The first to place all of their coat of arms wins the game. Players place workers to produce raw material that must be used to produce more refined material. These materials help you build different facilities to produce even more materials. The uniqueness of the actions is that you can do as much as you want as long as you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t pass the time marker. The time marker moves to the next player piece: which could be you depending on how many actions you take. So one must consider doing a small number of actions in order to go more often or take a long turn to do everything you may want. </notes>

    <notes>Condition - New in shrink-wrap.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
