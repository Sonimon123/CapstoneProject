   <description>The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten underground city of Gravehold. There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Note: (This includes the expansion Depths.) Fantastic condition played 5 times. Everything is organized and put in correct piles in box. I have also saved the original box for the expansion and it fits inside the large box. Infinite replay value. Very cool mechanic with the Rifts.</notes>

    <notes>Kickstarter edition w/ promos and both expansions.
The insert is gone. The mage and nemesis mats have warped some (I am looking to see if they can be replace). The components are in great shape, especially given the gloss finish and thin material.
Message me if you want me to ship it with the cards sleeved (premium thickness) for an extra $5.</notes>

All Kickstarter stretch goals and extras.
USED: Game has been opened and played, but all components are present, including boxes. The cards that are often shuffled have been sleeved. The non-shuffled cards have not been sleeved, and they feel like cards that have been played, but show no wear, and will look and feel like new if sleeved.
Buyer needs to cover the price of shipping.</notes>

    <notes>- Aeon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s end is a cooperative deck building game for 1-4 players that feels like an epic video game.  
- Your deck is never shuffled, a variable player order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management makes all of your decisions meaningful.    
- Every game you will face a different nemesis, each with a unique set of abilities requiring a different strategy to defeat.   
- Games play in 45 to 60 minutes, so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll want to play over and over again.
- Includes Breach Mage Level promos inside
- Unopened</notes>

    <notes>AE has been played about a dozen times.  The character boards and nemesis boards have warped some due to the humidity but are in great shape otherwise.  I sleeved the turn order cards since those are shuffled all the time.  None of the other cards were sleeved.  I will also be including a NIS The Depths expansion.  Buyer pays for shipping. I will ship via USPS.  I tend to use flat rate boxes for ease but I have several spare boxes and if it is cheaper to ship that way I will calculate the cost and let you know. Feel free to email me with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played a few times and the component quality is below average. The cards have a black border on the played side and some of them show a little wear. The card backs, thankfully, have a white border so the wear is not visible until the card is flipped. 
This comes with Aeon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s End: The Nameless Expansion and includes everything except the nemesis card dividers. The box base has some slight bubbling on one side from mismanufacture. 
Ships with tracking for $10.</notes>

When checking components, noticed that one of the breach tokens was missing. Have requested a replacement from manufacturer, and happy to send this on free of charge when it arrives. All other components all present and correct. Missing token will only affect a 4 player game, and can be easily replaced with a proxy without affecting gameplay.

Game has only been played once, all contents should be in great condition however I did notice some damage to one of the hero cards when taking pictures. I never used that particular hero so it may have arrived to me like that. Either way I included a picture of the damaged card.
