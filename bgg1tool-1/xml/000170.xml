   <description>Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Box and cards are in very good condition. HOWEVER: About 6 or 7 of the cards show a printing problem on their backs, looking as if they were _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;smeared_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; during printing. I have checked, and the cards in question are all of different types, so it is not as if the cards are directly identifiable from their backs. It might be possible over time to recognize the patters, and thus know what the card is. Given the rarity of this game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d think you would want to sleeve these cards anyway, which would make this a moot issue. Pictures available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and in excellent condition. As seems to be the case with many of these, the color printing on the cards backs is very uneven, with some being very dark, and others being much lighter. Having seen stuff like this a few times with this game, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it is unusual. Pictures available upon request. This is the standard Mayfair version.</notes>

    <notes>This game has been played perhaps 10 times.  All components are present and in good condition.  Some minor stains on the box, rules, and the face of a card or two (not the back of the cards, no cards are marked, and the game is just as playable as when it was new).
Shipping costs to be determined by buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s preferred shipping method and location.</notes>

Game is in excellent condition and looks unplayed. The game looks new and has only the very slightest of wear on the box. Otherwise bright and clean. Amazing shape for a game of this vintage. </notes>

    <notes>This is the 1989 Mayfair edition. The card decks are still in their original shrink but there is no shrink around the box so this is about as close to new as you can get...
Buyer to pay actual USPS Priority shipping. Personal checks must clear prior to shipment.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Ask me about how you can create an order where there will be no charge to ship this item as an add-on item if you purchase a big-box game at the same time.
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Game is complete. There is almost no wear on the edges or corners of the box, the cards, or the instruction manual. There is no crushing on the box. There is a SKU sticker on the barcode of the box. This would make a great addition to any collection! Offers welcome!</notes>

    <notes>This the ORIGINAL 1982 EDITION! Box has some wear around the edges and corners after 30+ years, but corners are all intact. There is some slight indentation to the box (more noticeable on the bottom).
Shipping in the U.S.A. will be USPS Priority Mail 2-Day Delivery (comes with tracking # and up to $50 insurance coverage). Mailing cost for most games will be $10.00 or less for USA delivery. Heavier games will be more expensive, but you can choose Standard Mail (delivery time 5-7 days) to get a lower shipping cost. Send me a message with your ZIP Code to ask for a firm price. Shipping discount available for multiple items on the same order (contact me for a price). 
**For international orders please ask for a shipping price quote.**</notes>
