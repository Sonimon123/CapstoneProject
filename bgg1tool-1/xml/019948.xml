   <description>Rum and Pirates is a relatively simple movement and collection game, known in German as Um Ru(h)m und Ehre (For Rum/Renown and Honor). The game was designed by Stefan Feld and is for 2-5 players ages 9 and up and plays in 60-75 minutes. On the Alea complexity scale of 1 (simple) to 10 (difficult), this game rates a 2. (Editor's Note: That is the same complexity as Chinatown, Wyatt Earp, and Edel, Stein _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Reich)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players take on the roles of freebooters who, back in their pirates' hideout, spend their time with all kinds of competitions - drinking, fighting, etc. All players move the main playing figure, the captain, through the alleys of the village, with the goal of gaining as much rum and reknown as possible. The end of each of the five rounds is also marked by a highly variable fight to claim the best sleeping spaces on board the ship (bed or board?). The game is a mixture of tactics, strategy, and luck. The die plays an important role in the game, but you still get the feeling of being at the mercy of fate only rarely._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game contains 76 plastic pirate figures, 9 game board pieces that ensure the board is always different, about 200 tiles, and 1 die._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description adapted from the Gamewire Essen Preview._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is #10 in the Alea big box series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 293)
The players take on the roles of pirates.They move the captain along the alleys of the pirates nest, looking for treasure maps and treasure chests. Or they meet the city guard and deal with them if they can. Naturally, they will visit the few pubs to gather and drink some rum together. They will also have opportunities to acquire the special wares needed by pirates like wooden legs and eye patches. At the end of the day, they head back to the ship and wrangle for the few sleeping places available there. All these activities earn the players tiles, which are worth honor points - most positive, but some are negative. These honor points are tallied at game end.</notes>

I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO293)
The players take on the roles of pirates.They move the captain along the alleys of the pirates nest, looking for treasure maps and treasure chests. Or they meet the city guard and deal with them if they can. Naturally, they will visit the few pubs to gather and drink some rum together. They will also have opportunities to acquire the special wares needed by pirates like wooden legs and eye patches. At the end of the day, they head back to the ship and wrangle for the few sleeping places available there. All these activities earn the players tiles, which are worth honor points - most positive, but some are negative. These honor points are tallied at game end.The player who ends the game with the most honor points is the winner!</notes>
