   <description>Pacific War is a strategic wargame that takes players from the attack on Pearl Harbor through the climactic summer of 1945... from Australia to China, from Burma to Hawaii... from the defense of Wake Island to the Guadalcanal campaign to the massive actions fought in desperate defense of the Japanese homeland._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For the first time in a Pacific Theater game, size, subtlety, and ease of play have come together in a game of sharp action and historical accuracy.  Players can become familiar with the layered Pacific War systems in the solitaire Engagement Scenarios, fighting their way through increasinly panoramic Battle, Campaign, and Strategic two-player and multi-player Scenarios.  Building on the game's basic maneuver and combat systems, players learn to conduct strategic bombing, merchant shipping attition, search and detection, amphibious assaults, and extensive Operations whose duration and cost they determine themselves._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Pacific War is a source of limitless challenge and excitement for every gamer ever fascinated with the vastness and fury of the Pacific Campaigns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Victory games Pacific war mega game.
General: In excellent condition, punched and I believe to be complete (all component checked except counters)
Box: In excellent condition, a little rubbing on one corner no splits or tears
Counters: 2340 quote, not checked, but all the counter are organised in either the counter tray, bags or match boxes and appropriately labelled.
Rules: in excellent condition 56 pages, no marks
Scenario book: Excellent condition also, there are a number of errata points and extra notes lightly marked up in pencil
Errata sheet: One page in excellent condition, one mistake corrected in pencil.
Maps: Excellent condition, only some minor wear on the corners
Display sheets: 2 one Japanese one Allied both in excellent condition
Operations sheet: one in excellent condition
Force display screens: 2 one Japanese one Allied both in excellent condition
Force display sheets: 8 four Japanese four Allied all in excellent condition, Allied display sheets 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;3 are marked Japanese display sheets 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;3.  The information on the allied a Japanese is identical (there basically for putting you task force units on) so I assume that this is either a packing or printing error by Victory Games. On these two sheets Japanese has been crossed out and Allied written lightly in pencil.
Replacement record sheets: One pad of approximately 25, perfect condition
Dice: 1D10
Weight: 1600g unpacked, 2000g packed in a cardboard box with bubble wrap

Shipping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Handling:
Germany: 7 Euro
International: please ask me in advance (before clicking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;BUY!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;) with your mailing priorities (land/surface etc.). Please note that the Deutsche Post (www.deutschepost.de, language may be switched to english) is rather expensive (e.g. roughly 2x more expensive for sending from Germany to US when vice versa).
I attend the GHS Con at Braunfels (Germany), thus if you also attend you may pick up the game there.</notes>

    <notes>Box is showing some shelf and edge wear.  I am listing this game as acceptable because I am unable to confirm that every counter is present.  All other game materials are present, but their are an awful lot of counters and while I have no reason to think any are missing I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know where to begin to inventory them all as present.
I will ship to the U.S. for $12.

    <notes>Partially punched copy (about 85% unpunched) that`s been verified complete and has been responsibly stored.Care has gone into that copy. It looks as if the charts and maps were not ever used; they are in such good shape. Box has some scuffs and scrapes and a corner had a collision so there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s one corner sort of compromised-but not much-I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d still rate the box as good = $74.
punched and verified complete with still excellent components-except for the rules booklet which has signs of usage decent box with storing wear = $58
Unpunched, never played,and thus complete. Bought it new myself eons ago and looked it over.Box looks great with virtually no storing abrasions-like none- it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only been stored and unbothered until I just checked it out...Near mint, if not mint= $94</notes>

    <notes>Game verified complete with a hand count. (Believe me that took awhile!) Counters are about 50% unpunched. The condition of the various handouts, screens, etc., would lead one to believe that the game has not been played. (Please see image of contents of this set loading below.)
Rulebook has a little wear from reading, and some staining on the back, but all other components are in pristine shape. Box has minor wear edge wear, but is in nice overall shape (no loose corners, etc.) 
This somewhat heavy game will ship in a USPS Flat Rate box.</notes>

Good amount of shelf wear on the bottom apron and the back of the box. A couple of small minor wrinkles on the back.  Nice copy of a great game.

    <notes>Brand new condition. In shrinkwrap. Pristine.
Please contact me for shipping costs if you live outside the UK.
Shipping in the UK is GBP 11.22, recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.
I pack very safely/securely.

    <notes>In good condition considering its been in storage for years.
Played a couple of times. Some counters punched. Most remain unpunched.
Rated acceptable because the manuals are slightly browned due to age and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not 100% sure that all the punched pieces are there. Otherwise I would rate good otherwise.
Will post to UK only. Postage cost 5 GBP.</notes>

    <notes>Pictures on request.
Map condition is ok. The rest is excellent. Never played by the looks of it. Partially punched (around 20%). Punched counters in 2 trays.
A more detailed description of condition:
Box: Some shelfwear, particular on corners. Very light wear, age considered. Backside of box has much wear / scratches (probably from moving the box around to get to other games)
Counters: No apparent discolouration. 2 trays with punched counters, rest is unpunched.
Scenario booklet 1: Pages appears unused (no bending), but 1 of 2 stables have gone off.
Scenario booklet 2: As scenario booklet 1
Rules of Play: Pages appears unused. Only sign of use is it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;opens up easily_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Map A: A bit of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;white_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; where is has been folded.
Map B: More pronounced white lines than map A. Still what can be expected from a map this age. Also it has a bit of bending, seems like it has been in slightly humid weather.
Replacement Record Sheet: Not sure how many has been used, but plenty left (25?). No bending.
Japanese Display Sheet: Like new.
Allied Display Sheet: Like new.
Japanese Screen: Like new.
Allied Screen: Like new.
Operation Display: Like new.
Errata: Like new.
Various force displays: Like new.</notes>

    <notes>Ok, its all there - 2340 counters all present and correct - some in a tray, more in bags and the majority still on the countersheets. The box is shelf-worn as you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d expect. The map, booklets, record sheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; players aids are all in good condition. The rule book has been marked up with highlighter but is still perfectly legible - probably more so. There are also a couple of copies of General articles, a sheet of errata from 1986 and an article from another publication.

    <notes>I have listed this game as Good for only one reason, the box has water damage. However, all contents are in perfect condition. The counters have not been punched. All rules, tables and aids are present. The map has been laminated. Because of this the map would be shipped separately in a tube, so shipping will be a bit higher than normal.</notes>

    <notes>counters are punched and will come with in three additional plastic hobby trays (the one provided with the game would only hold 1/10th of the counters...)
The counters and the rest of the material are in pristine condition, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is not an overstatement. I put _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because the box shows marks, only due to transport. Comes with the original rule book of course and also a french translation. I can provide pictures if needed of course. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m located around Chicago. I need to add to the total cost the shipping to your place.
