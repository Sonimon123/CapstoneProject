One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs; the other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes has special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The main mechanism of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game; conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated. The game is designed for quick set-up and fast play within 30 to 60 minutes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Sands of Time Games (SOE 1000)
Catacombs is an action/dexterity based adventure board game. One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs. The other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes have special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail. The main mechanic of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated. The game is designed for quick setup and fast play. </notes>

    <notes>Sands of Time Games (SOE1000)
Catacombs is an action/dexterity based adventure board game. One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs. The other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord. Each of the heroes have special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail. The main mechanic of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated. The game is designed for quick setup and fast play. </notes>

    <notes>This is one of the earlier editions.  I want to say second edition but then I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure how one tells.
Played three times.  Well cared for in a smoke free / pet free home.
Why price it below the rest of the marketplace items?  Well this is an early edition and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a kickstarted version coming out with new art.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also shipping to consider.
For me its about freeing up closet space and finding a good home for a game.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including the Caverns of Soloth expansion which is New in shrink.</notes>

    <notes>This price is for a bundle of Catacombs base game plus two expansions and additional content.
Bundle includes the following:
- Catacombs second edition, second printing (this I believe is what BGG calls _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;third edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;) 
- Cavern of Soloth  expansion
- Catacombs Dark Passageways expansion
- Catacombs Extra (printed official rules for variant)
- Domain of the Queen (printed rules for Labyrinth variant for Dark Passageways and Caverns of Soloth)
All above in Like New condition with cards sleeved:  basically box was opened, stickers were applied,  
and cards were sleeved.  Looked through Catacombs rule book, but never actually played any game.  
Will provide cost of shipping once address is given.</notes>

    <notes>Wooden pieces, character sheets and item/spell/monster cards are all in excellent condition. A few of the character cards have slight corner wear. Boards show light use (slight scuffing here and there from flicked discs) but no major wear. Box has minimal shelf wear.
** The deck of money cards had the not uncommon issue where the ink hadn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fully dried before it was packaged, so some of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;500_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards stuck together, and ink peeled off, mainly around the lower edges.  They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been touched up with sharpie so they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t look as bad as they did, but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re not perfect.  (They money cards in Catacombs suck anyway, you should use poker chips or something similar!) **</notes>

It can be picked up in Toowoomba or I can ship within Australia, shipping paid by the buyer. Cost of shipping will be charged at what it costs me to send to your location. I use the Australia Post website for calculating charges.
Any questions don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask :)

    <notes>This is for the 2011 version of the game.
Includes:
Catacombs (2011)
Cavern of Soloth (2011)
Dark Passageways (2012)
Horde of Vermin (2012)
Additional wooden pieces with updated third edition artwork (2015)
Please note, aside from the wooden pieces mentioned above none of the other pieces are stickered.  I was going to instead use Tzalem_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s excellent alternate artwork, but the third edition Kickstarter project was announced and I decided to just back that instead.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s nothing wrong with this edition of the game, I just prefer the third edition rules and artwork.
If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re still interested in making your own stickers, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the link to the artwork:  https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/79111/tzalems-complete-stickers-set-heroes-sheets</notes>

    <notes>I have played the Core Catacombs set twice but otherwise all components are in excellent condition.
In addition to the Core Catacombs game I also have the following 3 expansions which I could sell for Â£10 each (total price for Core game and 3 expansions would be Â£70 or best offer):
Catacombs: Dark Passageways - Very Good - (no box, stored in Core box)
Catacombs: Cavern of Soloth 1st Edition -  Very Good - (no box, stored in Core box)
Catacombs: Horde of Vermin -  Very Good - (no box, stored in Core box)
None of the expansions have ever been played. 
All stickers have been applied to core game and expansions.
Shipping to UK addresses will cost between Â£2.75 and Â£5.95 (with myhermes) depending on whether expansions are included.
Please get in touch for a shipping quote to non-UK destinations.</notes>

USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)
