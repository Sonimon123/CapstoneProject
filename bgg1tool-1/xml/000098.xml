   <description>Axis and Allies is the most successful of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It depicts WWII on a grand scale, full global level. Up to five players can play on two different teams. The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Axis and Allies was originally published by Nova Games in 1981._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Anniversary Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Allies: Global 1940 (Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific 1940 combined with Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Europe 1940)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Expanded by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Totally Untested Volume 2 of Max's Advanced Rules for Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies (Unofficial expansion)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Conquest of the Pacific (Unofficial expansion)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Midway (Unofficial expansion)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Box has been opened though, and has some shelfwear plus some modest dishing which seems typical for this style of box which leads me to list this game as in very good condition rather than like new

    <notes>1987 MB edition of Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies
Box has wear _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; tear - some bowing, small paper tears at the edges, but no split corners.
Contains Game Play Manual, board, battle board, shrinkwrapped deck of production certificates, the five reference charts, weapons development chart, Rules Clarification sheet, and six plastic-wrapped styrofoam game trays containing all the little pieces.  I have not counted all the pieces, but it *looks* complete - there are plenty of pieces for each country, all the dice are there, every country has control markers, and miniatures, etc.  If you need more details, I will provide them.</notes>

Box:  Light shelfwear with several dings, dents, and creases.  In addition, the box top has one split corner that extends approximately 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in each direction along the box edges.

Components:  Complete and in like new condition!  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.

U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 6 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

    <notes>I have the 1981, Nova Game Designs Citadel Series version of Axis and Allies.  Box has some shelf and some edgewear.  All game materials are present (I did not individually count all the chits for each set of playing pieces, and am not sure how many there should be anyway, but there are a substantial number of each nation).  Production certificates are crisp and lightly if ever circulated.
Shipping will be $8 to Eastern and Central parts of the US and $10 to Mountain and Pacific.  Other regions please inquire. </notes>

    <notes>Milton Bradley second edition. Good playable condition. Box has wear, including one taped corner on the bottom and one split corner on the top. Contains 17 infantry per country instead of the listed 15. Missing 3 control markers: one British, one German, and one US (the game is supposed to have 20 per country and these countries only have 19). These missing markers shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect gameplay. Contains 6 red and 56 white plastic discs (rules don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t specify how many it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s supposed to have). The rules also don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t list the money count - this copy has 32xOnes, 33xFives, 32xTens.
Shipping is $18. Combined shipping rates are available when purchasing multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>Milton Bradley Game Master series. Used. Very clean and almost complete. It is missing one US flag marker and probably a few bills of the money. There are 18 British infantry and 17 for all other nations. (The picture on the box only shows 15 per country.) Box has dishing on the top and a nicely repaired corner. Definitely a good playing copy.</notes>

Payment Notes:
Non-US buyers will have to pay via Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) (as it is the only way that I can assure that there will not be any funny business) unless you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks. You must also have zero negative BGG Marketplace feedbacks and zero negative BGG Trade feedbacks in which case I would be able to accept a Paypal payment. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
US buyers: USPS money order is preferred.
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
However, I can also take a Paypal payment if you have _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Marketplace feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 50 positive BGG Trade feedbacks OR _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 75 combined positive BGG Marketplace plus Trade feedbacks. You must also have zero negative BGG Marketplace feedbacks and zero negative BGG Trade feedbacks. But the only type of Paypal payment that I can accept is one funded by a Paypal balance or an immediate bank transfer. I cannot take a Paypal payment that is funded via credit card.
If the receiver elects not to pay extra for insurance (totally up to you) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages.
Non-US buyers: Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.</notes>

    <notes>I have two copies of MB_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies for sale.  Both copies have the second edition rules included (along with a single sheet printout of the third edition rules changes).
These games were acquired way back in the late 1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s/early 1990_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  So, these are not new games.  However, they are still in pretty good shape after twenty-plus years.
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think these two copies of the game were ever played.  If they were, it was only once.
Both game boxes are acceptable due to being around for 20+ years.  They have various scratches and marks on them.  The box lid is certainly flaring along the long edges.  Ink has rubbed off at the box corners (as one would expect).
Both game boxes also have indentations from other games being on top of them.  One of the game boxes has a circle indentation.  Not sure where that came from.
Inside, the components are in very good condition.  All components are present (via a rough count).  All five country Reference Charts are present along with the National Production Chart and the battleboard.
Each game still has the original six game trays (one for each country and one for common components).  Each individual game tray has been wrapped in plastic wrap to keep the components together and in the same tray.  This applies to both games.  Components have appeared to bounce around in each game tray, but have stayed to each game tray.
In one copy of the game, the money bounced around the game box.  Some of the money was bent and folded just a bit.  Both sets of money are now in a plastic bag.
Both games come from a non-smoking house.</notes>

    <notes>I have two copies of MB_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies for sale.  Both copies have the second edition rules included (along with a single sheet printout of the third edition rules changes).
These games were acquired way back in the late 1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s/early 1990_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  So, these are not new games.  However, they are still in pretty good shape after twenty-plus years.
I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think these two copies of the game were ever played.  If they were, it was only once.
Both game boxes are acceptable due to being around for 20+ years.  They have various scratches and marks on them.  The box lid is certainly flaring along the long edges.  Ink has rubbed off at the box corners (as one would expect).
Both game boxes also have indentations from other games being on top of them.  One of the game boxes has a circle indentation.  Not sure where that came from.

    <notes>Childhood relic from my old bedroom at mom_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s house. I played the heck out of this as a college kid, but somehow kept the game in VG condition. Complete, but the dang cover is dished; mom stacked a bunch of games on top of each other over the years. Oversized, $18.95 for shipping. Thanks, take care,,,</notes>

These are high quality dice taken from a Perudo game.

    <notes>Box is in very rough shape, clear tape, strapping tape and duct tape have been used to patch it up. Components are actually in pretty good shape overall. Extra dice, though I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if any are original. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;World At War 39 - 45 by Xeno Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map included. Couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find a detailed component inventory, but there looks to be plenty of everything included, and there are some bags/packages of extra pieces as well.
