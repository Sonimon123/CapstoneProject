   <description>Advanced Third Reich is a board wargame published originally by The Avalon Hill Game Co. The game is a rewrite of Rise and Decline of the Third Reich,  and is a simulation of the European and African theaters of World War II. In 2003 GMT Games published A World at War, a substantially revamped and streamlined version of Advanced Third Reich, designed by Bruce Harper.  Designed to reflect the corps scale, a turn represents three months of movement and fighting._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This game rates good but really the components are “like new” while the box is only “acceptable” sporting some damage.  The game itself is unpunched and complete.  If you have a spare Advanced Third Reich box sitting around you’re golden!
The picture is the actual game for sale.  I included one picture of the side of the box that has what looks like spray paint on it as well as the dinged corner.  As I said, the components are solid, even includes an issue of “Ultra.”  Write with any questions.
I only ask for actual postage, estimated at $6 for priority mail in the US.  Better yet, stop by and pick it up!

    <notes>Looking to make some room on my game shelves and have decided to part with my copy of Third Reich. Bought new back in the early 90_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played it a couple times with friends.  
All components are punched, included, and in good shape. The box has some minor superficial wear, but nothing structurally damaged.
Will ship at whatever it costs to send USPS priority mail with shipping confirmation (or via another company if you request and pay shipping costs).
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m relatively new to selling on BGG so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included a link to my eBay rating:

    <notes>This is the last AVALON HILL Edition before GMT bought the rights.  Two rule books included.  Maps have been trimmed to fit Plexiglas display, but all charts, etc. are complete.  Counters are clipped, but not organized by force or nationality. I will ship free for sale price. This is a great spare game for long-haul players of this classic. Check out my other games--low shipping rate available for multiple purchases.

    <notes>90% Punched, sorted into ziploc bags.  Components in VG condition.  Box shows some creasing along the top, and some wear on the corners.  The rulebook has some highlighting as well.  This is definitely a players copy, though it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s otherwise in good shape, and everything is present.
I am also selling a copy of Empire of the Rising Sun, which is 90% unpunched and never played.
Buyer to pay $13.45 usps flat rate, unless you want to do something different.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Condition - Unpunched and unplayed, box has very light shelf wear, components in like new condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
