   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Another great looking game that I looked through, opened the cards and never played.  The cards have some of the most beautiful and horrific(In a good way) art I have ever seen.  Compares favorably to some of the old Vampire The Eternal Struggle and Rage cards.  Everything is in excellent shape.  Shipping is $12 anywhere within the lower 48 states.  I will also ship to Hawaii and Alaska using USPS priority chart.</notes>

    <notes>This is for TWO core sets. 
Both are opened, but have only ever been unpacked. Everything is in unplayed condition.
4 of the 5 suggested starter decks have been created and all the other cards are in whatever order they came in.
Complete and in great shape. If both boxes are desired, I can ship that way. Obviously, that will affect shipping charges.
Buyer to pay actual shipping.
Thank you for looking; all the best!</notes>

    <notes>This is the perfect collection for anyone who wants to get into Arkham Horror LCG. You get the following:
- A Hobby Lobby Artist case WITH a broken token insert installed (5-row vertical to be specific)
- Arkham Horror LCG Core Game (sleeved, never played)
- Carnevale of Horrors (sleeved, never played)
- Curse of the Rougarou (sleeved, never played)
- Dunwich Legacy Deluxe Expansion (New in Shrink)
- The Miskatonic Museum (New)
- Blood on the Altar (New)
- The Essex County Express (New)
- The Countless Terrors 1-4 Players neoprene Playmat (New)
- Upgraded tokens (new hearts, brains, and crates... Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry you get all the original tokens as well)
- Cthulhu dice bag for chit draws
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve done the work of getting the storage case, buying the insert and putting it in the case, sleeving the core set, and buying every available card... And I realize the game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for me.
Shipping will be a flat $20. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure it will be more than that, but if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve come this far, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t mind. I want everything to have a good home where the game will actually be played.
I also have enough extra sleeves to sleeve the rest of the cards. These are high quality upper deck sleeves, not penny sleeves. Let me know if you want them and I will include them for an extra $10.
I understand it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big purchase, so don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to geekmail me if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>TWO CORE SETS + [b][thing=215510]Carnevale of Horrors Scenario Pack[/thing][/b] + [b][thing=209728]Curse of the Rougarou Scenario Pack[/thing][/b]
Arkham Horror LCG is in excellent condition.  The first scenario has only been played twice.  I have both core boxes, but the game is stored in only one of them.  I tossed the insert for the box I keep the game in.  The tokens are stored in a plano-syle box and the cards are stored in envelope-style deck boxes (see picture).  One of the resource tokens is missing, but you have two sets worth.  One of the rulebooks is a little wrinkled.  The scenario packs are no longer in their clamshells.  Like I said, the game is in excellent condition but there are a few tiny things I wanted to make sure to tell you.

    <notes>Includes:
(1) Arkham Horror LCG: Core Set (no insert, typical FFG trash insert was recycled)
(1) Arkham Horror LCG: The Dunwich Legacy Deluxe Expansion (no box)
*Ultra-pro matte sleeves for all player and encounter cards (pre-sleeved) - the act, agenda, and location cards are currently NOT sleeved
*Custom innsmouth gazette _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;large_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; drawbag (~6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) - professionally printed
Core game has been played through (2) times, and the expansion (1) time. I would list this as like new due to the sleeves, but the rulebooks have been pawed through - just normal use, nothing excessive. Buyer pays $14 shipping. Game comes from a smoke-free home. Reasonable offers will be considered after an appropriate waiting period. FANTASTIC GAME, just not the theme for me.
EXTRAS:
I have (2) extra sets of the ultra-pro sleeves available. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like them, please let me know - $5.00 per 100 sleeves.
I also have the following on order at miniaturemarket.com:
*Arkham Horror LCG: Carnevale of Horrors Scenario Pack
*Arkham Horror LCG: Curse of the Rougarou Scenario Pack
*Arkham Horror LCG: The Miskatonic Museum Mythos Pack
*Arkham Horror LCG: The Essex County Express Mythos Pack
*Arkham Horror LCG: Blood on the Altar Mythos Pack
*Arkham Horror LCG: Undimensioned _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Unseen Mythos Pack (Preorder, may delay shipping of the mythos packs)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing these only because they are currently sold out/hard to find. If you would like any or all of these, please let me know - this will add $13 per pack plus shipping (which should be $10-14 for all of these). Instead of paying shipping, I could order you something else on MM to hit the $100 free shipping mark - (5) sets of 100 sleeves would do it... or something else?</notes>

    <notes>This is a package deal!
Included is the Arkham Horror Card Game Core Set (Very Good), as well as the Dunwich Legacy Expansion (new - in shrink-wrap!) and the two scenario expansions, Curse of the Rougarou and Carnivale of Horrors - both new and in their clamshell cases!
The core set is in great condition, and is the only set of these that has been used (three times).  The campaign guide was written on (on the back page), but not all of the spaces have been filled-in. The set remains in very good condition besides.
This is a great deal if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been wanting to dive deep into the game on your first go!</notes>

I removed the base insert and the dunwich box, so that all the components fit into the base box. Sorry, I no longer have the original insert or the DL box. 
The base game has only been played 4 times. The Dunwich Legacy components are unused and still wrapped in in their original wrappers! Everything is in pristine condition!</notes>

    <notes>- TWO English-language core sets SOLD TOGETHER (non-negotiable - i will not split them up).
- Buyer must pay all shipping fees. It will be shipped from southern Germany.
- Payment via PayPal or direct bank transfer, as the buyer prefers.
- All cards are sleeved in thick sleeves and were placed in sleeves directly after unpacking, so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re as pristine as possible.
- One of the sets of Chaos Tokens is encased in plastic coin capsules (approx. value = 8 Euros), so they are in pristine condition. (See photo album link below for pictures.)
- All tokens are punched except for the 2nd set of Chaos Tokens.
- Only played 5 (incomplete) sessions, so there is effectively no wear on the remaining tokens.
- Both boxes and all included booklets (2 copies of each) are in excellent condition.
- 80 Euros is what i paid for the two core sets (in mid-November, 2016). The included sleeves and coin capsules are costs i will absorb myself (the buyer gets them _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for free_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;). Likewise, i_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not charging extra for the hassle of walking the shipment 2km to the next post office.
- Photo album: https://goo.gl/photos/4AZiMXCASGdQTuAMA (the card and token storage boxes shown there are NOT included unless the buyer adds 20 Euros to cover my costs for replacing them)
- Reason for selling: i had high hopes for the game, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s far too sadistic for my tastes.
- Feel free to contact me with any question regarding this set.</notes>

    <notes>2 CORE SETS of the Arkham Horror LCG for sale. Prefer to sell them together. Just to be clear, the price listed is for BOTH of them, not each.
With two core sets, you can play the campaign with 3 or 4 players, or run two separate campaigns concurrently.
Photos of both sets are attached. The sets come from a non-smoking household and the cards have no damage to them. I have also re-sorted all the cards into their original order (took me ages!) for both sets so you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re ready to play.
Core Set 1 - this is the main set I used. As you can see in the photos, I disposed of the FFG cardboard box insert. I have bagged all the tokens. Some red wine got spilled onto the front cover of the rule book but this has only gone on the front page and has not damaged the rest of the book. I used photocopies of the campaign sheet so the campaign book is totally unmarked.
As you can also see in the photo, I have upgraded all the chaos tokens in this set and put them in coin cases. This was an amazing tip I got from YouTube and makes picking the tokens out of your chaos bag so much more satisfying! They have a lovely sound and feel in the bag (and also preserve your tokens from dirty fingers!). All of these are included. 
Core Set 2 - The cards have been resorted and bagged, but all the tokens remain unpunched and shrink-wrapped. There is no damage to any of the cards or books.
P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P to a UK address is £4. Please contact me for international quotes. I send all my games by trackable services so you can follow their progress and get peace of mind that we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re covered if they go missing. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This is for an AMAZING Arkham Horror: The Card Game Bundle. It contains:
2 Core Arkham Horror: The Card Game Core Sets
Curse of the Rougarou
Carnevale of Horrors 
2 Dunwhich Legacy Core Sets
The complete set of Dunwhich Legacy Mythos Packs: Miskatonic Museum, Essex County Express, Blood on the Altar, Undimensioned and Unseen, Where Doom Awaits, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Lost in Time and Space 
All cards were sleeved in Dragon Shield Sleeves prior to play. If the card had a standard card back, they are in Clear Matte sleeves. If the card is double sided, they are in Standard Clear sleeves.
All cards used for Character Deck building are in a Z-Folio 16/page Binder. They have been sorted by color first and then by number. All the Common Scenario cards are in a cardboard deck box (pictured) separated by dividers. The cards that are specific to a scenario are in Dragon Shield Deck boxes within the same box. 
One of the sets of Chaos tokens was unpunched until the Coin Cases arrived. They were then punched and immediately placed in the Coin Cases. The Dice Bag is a fantasy Flight Cthulhu Dice Bag. The Health _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Sanity tokens, Clue/Doom Tokens, and Supply tokens from both sets are included in Bit Boxes. 
The Playmat is this version: https://www.coolstuffinc.com/p/235802 and was never used. Still in original packaging.
Everything (except for the playmat _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Binder) fits into the box with a little room to spare. Extra dividers are included.
You are getting this for a STEAL and all pre-sleeved, sorted, and ready to play! Buyer pays shipping from Chicago IL using whatever method you prefer.</notes>

    <notes>The game comes from a private collection (non-smoking and pet-free environment).
It has been opened and played once. All components are in excellent condition.
The box lid is still in its original shrink wrap for extra protection. It can be easily removed in case you find it unnecessary. I’m simply very picky about game condition and like to give my games this extra protection :)

    <notes>Looking to sell everything I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve accumulated for the Arkham Horror LCG. I bought all the expansions and mythos packs so I would stay up to date, but I just have not found the time to play it and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if I ever will. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s one of those things where I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather pull out a book or play a video game in my free time. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only opened the two core sets and played the first mission. Photos: https://imgur.com/a/4TNa5 
Anyway, what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s included:
*Artist Wooden Box from Hobby Lobby
*Token bag (x2)
*Ultra Pro Deck Box (x2)
*Instruction Manuals for Expansions and Mythos Packs
*Core set (x2)
*The Dunwich Legacy
*The Miskatonic Museum
*The Essex County Express
*Blood on the Altar
*Undimensioned and Unseen
*Where Doom Awaits
*Lost in Time and Space
*The Path to Carcosa
*Echoes of the Past
*The Unspeakable Oath
*The Phantom of Truth
*Curse of the Rougarou
*Carnevale of Horrors</notes>

    <notes>Its the core, the dunwich exp, its first 4 packs (2 missing to be completed), and the 2 stand alone expansions (Curse of the Rougarou, Carnivalle of horrors)
Plus a box to fit them all in, a handmade insert, 2 tuck boxes to store your investigators, sleeves for all investigators cards and a few other minor cosmetic items (binders for all classes, printed help pages etc).
A few notes:
- you can further customise the box (with paint) to make it more thematic. It is something I wanted to do but never found the time.
- it easily fits at least 2 additional circles, if not more.
- please bare in mind that it is missing the last 2 packs from the dunwhich circle -- they are still difficult to get them in Greece.
- each pack has been played 1-2 times, always with sleeves on the investigator cards
- there are still some sleeves left</notes>

    <notes>I am selling not one, but TWO core sets, combined in one core box, for a good price (nearly getting a second core for free if you were to pay typical online prices).  This is great if you want to maximize deckbuilding opportunities, since having two cores gives you extra copies of cards.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only played the first core a few times, many months ago.  I recently added the second core, but haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t gotten around to actually playing it due to time constraints.  It still has that new game smell.  Everything is in excellent condition.  No smoking, drinking, or food near it.  
If interested, I will try to keep shipping costs as low as possible and give you an estimate.</notes>

All player cards (except those from RtNotZ) are sleeved in clear matte Titanshields and every non-player card (encounter cards, investigator cards, etc) are sleeved in KMC Perfect Fits. All mini investigator cards are sleeved in FFG mini yellow sleeves. There are still a ton more of the yellow sleeves and probably between 50-100 extra KMC Perfect Fit sleeves.
All tokens have been punched and are in a handy Plano box.
All cards are stored in the RtNotZ box and another 660-count storage box.
Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an image of my collection: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4314022/itsjreal
I have all of the original boxes and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure all of the clamshells the products originally came in.
I travel back and forth often so I can ship domestically from either US or Canada.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m getting rid of my collection to trim down before moving.  This is not just the starter with the box.  I am including my collection of mythos as well.
With boxes/cases:
Arkham Horror: The Card Game - Base (1)
Carnivale of Horrors Scenario Pack (1)
Curse of the Rougrarou Scenario Pack (1)
Lost in Time and Space Mythos Pack (2) (never opened)
Undimensioned and Unseen Mythos Pack (1) (never opened)
Without boxes:  (cards stored in cardboard card storage box)
Dunwich Legacy (never played)
Additional materials:
Not that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including for sale, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve printed off, folded and sleeved a few community scenarios.
I have laminated dividers in the cardboard box.
Some of the cards are sleeved.
I have a faux felt with faux silk liner dice bag for randomizing tokens that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include.
I took great care of this game while I played it.  I am moving and my wife wants to pack and store less during the process.  I have other games I want to try out so need to clear up space so my wife won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t freak out when I buy more games at the new house.  If someone could make a comparable trade for Dragonfire, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m totally up for that.
I will accept PayPal, Simple, or Apply Pay as payment.</notes>
