   <description>Description from the publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mega Civilization, a huge version of the legendary development game Civilization, is a game of skill for 5 to 18 players covering the historical development of ancient civilizations from just after the last Ice Age to the dawn of the new era at the end of the Iron Age _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; a time span of almost 8,000 years. Each player leads their own civilization as it tries to expand its culture over a map board that stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to India._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Mega Civilization is not a wargame as you might expect when looking at the map board. Instead, the objective of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, scientific, political, civic, and religious factors. The player who most effectively balances these various goals will achieve the best scores and win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In more detail, the objective of Mega Civilization is to acquire the highest number of victory points (VPs) by building cities and developing Civilization Advances. This will be done over various phases and turns, some of which will be performed simultaneously by the players. After each turn, a check is made for each player to move forward on the Archaeological Succession Table (A.S.T.). Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age. Advancement there will provide even more VPs. The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T. or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each civilization begins with a single population token, and every turn each player increases their population by adding tokens to each area they occupy. These tokens can be moved over the map board by land or (using ships) by sea. As each area has a population limit, a good strategic overview will give players advantage in occupying more and more areas. If a player manages to move sufficient tokens into an area, they can build a city there. These cities generate trade cards which will eventually lead to wealth. During trade sessions, players receive not only the commodities they need to complete sets; they might also receive calamities which will remove population or cities. Specific Civilization Advances will protect the players from natural or civic calamities. The development of these Civilization Advances is symbolized by turning in sets of trading goods, as the wealthier civilizations will acquire more Civilization Advances._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As civilizations develop, it will be harder for their rulers to find the right balance between future population growth, maintaining enough support for their cities, and increasing their treasury. If they cannot manage their token population, their cities might eventually revolt during the tax collection phase. The civilizations with the strongest economy traditionally score the highest._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A game of Mega Civilization can take 10-12 hours to complete. Players can also choose to play the beginner scenario _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The First Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; which takes only 1-2 hours. Another scenario _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Short Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; provides the same excitement as the full game, although the game starts in a later age; by doing this, games can be played in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;only_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; 6-8 hours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>New in shrink. 
Happy to accept PayPal, money orders, Amazon/OLGS gift cards, cashiers or personal checks but you will need to cover any associated fees, if any, other than the 3% going to BGG.
Local pick-up available in Kew Gardens, Queens NY. 
You pay only the actual shipping rounded up to the nearest dollar, priority or cheapest, whichever is preferred. I have online accounts with FedEx, UPS, and USPS and pass on those discounts to you. (as much as 10-20% off what you’d pay at the counter) 
That said this game is both HUGE and HEAVY (25 pounds!) so shipping is still likely to run as much as $20-$50 depending on your location and the type of address. (FedEx Ground to a non-residential address will be substantially cheaper than USPS for example)
International orders require insurance to protect us both in the event of loss or damage.
Also happy to combine shipping with any other games I have listed for sale/trade.

    <notes>This has been unwrapped, counters punched and cards organized in baggies; otherwise, this is like-new, unplayed condition from smoke free home. Decided to sell because I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the people to get this game to the table.   All cards are inventoried and complete. The cardboard wrap around on the outside of the box has been taped together so as not to come undone (albeit with tape that could be removed if desired).  Buyer to pay shipping (most likely Fed Ex or maybe UPS - whatever is cheapest for you), additional insurance if desired and the pay pal fee.</notes>

    <notes>Brand New but not in shrink. the hinges on the back side of the box part of them came undone and I needed to repair it. There are little scratches on the hinges but you have to look close to see it. Otherwise everything is new inside and still in their shrink. Because I opened it to repair I know the number of the box and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 1926 out of 3000.  FYI this game without a shipping box and packing is almost 24 lbs. As always I always get you the best shipping prices and NEVER charge a handling/hidden fee for shipping. This is on hand and ready to ship.</notes>

    <notes>Brand new in shrink. The crown jewel of my collection. Just don’t think I’ll be able to get it to the table anytime soon. Free delivery in Portland Area. Shipping to US addresses is $40 for ups ground. Worldwide shipping quotes available on request, but be prepared for very high rates. Would much rather sell locally since it weighs 30 lbs and I’d really prefer not to risk it getting damaged in transit.</notes>
