   <description>Rail Baron is one of the earlier train games - boardgames with a railroad theme._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players move trains along historical USA railroad lines and collect delivery payoffs. They compete to purchase the railroads in order to assemble a network that gives access to important map destinations while simultaneously trying to prevent their opponents from doing so._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the Box (Avalon Hill Bookshelf Game)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Only in America!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You are living in the heyday of the locomotive. You are Jay Gould. And you have just added another railroad to your vast railroad empire. Flushed with success, you now retire to the sartorial splendor of your very own Pullman Palace Car. The dream ends. You awaken to reality with the thought... _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;just another fantasy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Ahh, but for the grace of Avalon Hill, you dream continues._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Here, in Rail Baron, you become a latter day Gould, or a Cornelius Vanderbilt, or any of those menacingly infamous moguls whose wizardry and acumen established the criteria for which business success was to be judged in decades to come._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rail Baron is played on a large board of the United States RR network. in fact, it comes in three separate boards. Laid end to end, it spell out America and portrays the 28 major rail lines and major cities they connected during the halcyon days of railroading._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You start with $20,000 - and a train. You make money on trips from city to city. Pretty soon you've got enough money to build up your empire (you can buy the B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;O and C_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;O for just $44,000). More holdings bring more money your way (track rental) from your opponents._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With many new nuances of strategy, it becomes a game where fortunes see-saw until the last rail baron is bankrupt - or has accumulated the $200,000 needed to win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;All of this may take 3 to 4 hours. But it's great fun for 3 to 6 people, ages 10 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; up._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This popular, vintage Avalon Hill game is in its original shrinkwrap; cover has nice vibrant color.  After purchasing, I decided I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not so interested in the game, and want to make it available to someone who might really want a brand new copy.  I will accept payment of $90 US as well.  Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the price?  Make me an offer!  I have US and European addresses for payment, but be aware the game will ship from the Netherlands, so shipping costs need to be considered.  Please write to me for any other information you might need, and to arrange shipping and payment options.</notes>

Box has tape where it was _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;sealed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; on two sides that could be removed (I simply cut it with a knife). I also found a ding in one side of the box (don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how I missed that before). There is a round sticker on the front which says _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Ages 8 and above_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. I accept payment either by check, or Paypal if funded from a cash account.

This is a near playable copy of Rail Baron for someone that just really wants to play the game.  Included are:
- Rules
- Payoff Chart
- Map boards
- Rail Line Title Cards
- Money
It is missing:
- Box
- Express Title Cards (there are supposed to be 6 of these; you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need someone to make a scan)
- Superchief Cards (there are supposed to be 6 of these: you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need someone to make a scan)
- Pawns and tokens (the game came with very generic pawns and tokens, so you can use anything as replacement)
Basically, the only missing parts that are not easily replaceable are the box, express and superchief cards.  Like I said earlier, a print-out of the missing cards would do you just fine though.

It looks like these have been played with, mostly the 221B Baker Street as there are pencil markings in the booklets and a few stars drawn on a key piece.  All games are intact, with minor scuffing on the boxes.  </notes>

    <notes>I am the original owner of this game.  It has never been played, it has very light shelf wear, it is in perfect condition, the game was unwrapped and the pieces have been punched.  I think I bought this game in the early 1980s and it sat on my shelves the entire time.  Really.

I accept these forms of payment:
(1) PayPal - add 3.9% [account lvcipriani@yahoo.com]
(2) Money Order (From U.S. or Canadian Post Offices Only)
(3) Cashiers Check drawn from a U.S. Bank or Credit Union
No returns.  Really, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in perfect condition.
I am a new seller on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Geek_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; but you can view my 100% positive feedback on ebay under the same user id.
Game will be shipped within three days after receiving payment.

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

This game is complete!  Game parts are in good condition, as explained in the list below.
Contents:
Three-section game board (Boards are just a bit loose at the fold, and one has a two-inch strip of cellophane tape to repair a small tear, but this does not affect game play and boards are very much usable) 
28 Rail line title cards (Good condition. No creases or folds)
6 Express cards
6 Superchief cards (Express and Superchief cards in good condition, no folds or creases)
6 sets of colored tokens: each set having one pawn and two matching chips. (Complete)
2 white dice and one red die.
Payoff chart: (Chart is well-thumbed, worn, torn at page edges and soiled a bit. But still readable and usable)
Instructions (intact)
Play Money as follows:
30--$500 bills
30--$1,000 bills
30--$5,000 bills
62--$10,000 bills
15--$50,000 bills
For a total of $1,565,000 in play money.
Note: a few of the bills seem to be faded a little bit, but still legible and usable.
Game box is worn at edges and corners, but intact. No split corners and no tape!
Note: there are also four plastic clips in the game which are not listed in the game rules.

Box:  Light shelfwear with a few very minor dings, dents, and creases.   Overall the box is in excellent condition!
Components:  Complete and in like new condition!  Everything is crisp and gorgeous and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even have that weird musty smell common for old Avalon Hill games.  Pieces have been stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.

Play money not bent up or creased, etc.  I take good care of my games.  Box has remarkably little shelf wear but is scuffed up a good deal on the bottom of the box lid.  No splits, tho.  Map, some cards, and the rules do have some brown age spots.  That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the only thing keeping this from being in the VG category.  Checked for completeness.</notes>

Won in the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;25 games - 1 Week_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; auction
The box has has a fair amount of shelf wear (whitened edges etc), but is still sound. 
Components are complete and in good condition with these notes:
1. The rules have what appears to be some water damage.
2. The boards are in very good condition except for some _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;splashed_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; white spots on the back of two and one or two minor marks on the artwork of the boards. 
3. The dice are included, but they are not guaranteed to be the originals (though they appear to be so).
4. The cards, pawns, and chips are all in very good to excellent condition.
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way. I will combine shipping with multiple items. From US zip code: 97520.</notes>

-------------------
Due to high shipping costs and general amount of paper work involved, I am limiting the sale on this game to US only.
This game is listed as part of a group that I am selling to benefit the Sun Tzu Military History Museum.
The games were owned by friend who passed this past January, and he wanted to make sure his games were
sold to benefit his charity of choice.  
Many of the games have rules underlining, which I have tried to catalog in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition.  I have also 
tried to give as complete and accurate description as possible.  Games are complete, unless otherwise noted.  A few of the older games may have handmade
replacement counters.  Again, I have tried to identify these items in the game description.  If you are concerned about specifics of condition that are not in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s description, please geekmail me, and I will give a very specific accounting of whatever
you may have questions on.
For any games that are missing pieces, I heartily recommend checking the BGG Spare Parts 2012 wanted/have geeklist.  Several users of this site have been very generous in helping find missing components!  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/76707/2012-spare-parts-resource-list
Prices are firm on single purchases, but I will consider offers on multiple games.  I will ship multiple purchases together to try and save you money on shipping.
Photos are available upon request!
Local pickup available in the Denver Metro area.  I live in South West Aurora and we can meet at a place that makes sense. </notes>

    <notes>Complete - although money was not counted (and original quantity is unknown).
Graded acceptable for these reasons: Some minor stains to instructions, a couple of words written on the payoff chart (and some light wrinkling on both), and some obvious wear to box - light bump to one corner, 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; crease in top, and general edge wear.
The three game board pieces and the money are in VG condition.  The boards show only light wear and only one bill in the currency has a crease.  Money shows very little wear.</notes>

    <notes>Rail Baron - Avalon Hill 2nd Edition, 1980
This copy is missing two player pawns (yellow and black) and one red and blue chip.  Some of the cards are clear-taped, apparently as an earlier form of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;sleeving._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  The three sections of the board were also taped together by the previous owner.  The box has some dishing on top and two torn corners, one of which has been taped.  This is definitely a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy.
Shipping is available to USA and Canada from zip code 97355 at buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense.</notes>

    <notes>This is a great 2nd Edition copy of Rail Barons. It has been played but shows minimal signs of use and was kept in great condition. It has been thoroughly inventoried and contains all cards, pawns, boards, paperwork and even a 1970_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Avalon Hill catalog. :)
The only missing item is 2 of the brown tokens but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been replaced with another set of nice tokens.  Game boards are in excellent shape. The box has almost no shelf ware and no dishing or split corners. There is a small spot on the underside where the price was written in marker. 
If not for the replaced tokens and price, I would have listed this as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
I will ship via either USPS or UPS and am willing to ship internationally. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>1977 1st edition.
All cards, rules, charts, and board sections are included, but it is missing the yellow pawn and one yellow chip.
A few of the express and superchief cards have little flaws, like a crease, torn corner, or tiny stain.
A couple of the deed cards have tiny stains. They also might be yellowed a bit, but this is noticeable mostly on the back.
This copy does not include board clips, but the contents don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t list them either-- maybe there weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t any in the first edition?  The board is in excellent condition.
The rules and charts are in good condition, I see one stain in an area where there is no writing.
The box has no split corners, but does have dishing and lots of shelfwear and little scuffs. There is a strip of clear tape running along the outside of the box bottom, and extending a little ways onto the box top.
Buyer to pay shipping, actual shipping cost only. Actual cost depends on your zip code, maximum within the U.S. would be $9.50.</notes>

    <notes>Box cover has moderate shelf wear. I bought this used and it has a lot of extra (but not necessarily useful) material. Two copies of rules and destination tables. A bunch of destination tables and documentation from RBxxx maps, but NO extra maps. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some railgamefans.com cardboard money and four bricks of AH money. This makes the box pretty heavy. International buyers may prefer that I discard the extra material to save shipping cost.</notes>

Avalon Hill
1977
Includes 3-section Mapboard of the United States; Rulebook  (with Destination Chart); Payoff Chart; 28 Rail Line Title Cards; 6 Express Title Cards; 5 (of 6) Superchief Title Cards; 2 blank title cards; 6 sets of colored tokens (a pawn with at least two chips of matching color) - the red pawn is missing, but I can provide a non-matching replacement upon request; 2 white dice; 1 red die; play money.  
There are two pieces missing: the red pawn (I can provide a replacement if you like, but it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be the same shape as the other pawns), and one Superchief title card (there are two blank title cards that are not used in the game, so a replacement can be quickly improvised).
Box has significant wear.  No split corners, but there is a lot of scuffing, some creasing on the box lid, and price tag residue.

Edition: Avalon Hill 1980, second edition, English
Contents Condition: All New. Unpunched, never played. All original components intact. I am the original owner. Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember why I bought it but I kept it safely stored through all these past decades. 
Box Condition: VG. Shows moderate shelf wear due to it being 40 years old. Box is still solid with no dings, dents, or split corners.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been gently played, well preserved.  Avalon Hill Game Company version, 1977
My late husband collected board games, he didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play all of them, but he sure liked to collect.  If game was played, he took excellent care, no food or drink allowed near his games.  The time has come to find new homes for his precious games. :)  Hoping that they will all go to board game enthusiasts like him.  Please feel free to ask any questions.  I will try to answer.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>I am open to reasonable offers. I would rather sell this than have it sit on my shelf, but since my copy is a strange mix of Like New and Good, I may want to hold out for a bit to get a good price.
PLEASE READ THIS NEXT PART CAREFULLY! I WILL EXACTLY DESCRIBE THE CONDITION HERE. If you make a purchase, you agree to receive a copy as in the description/as shown in the photos.
BOX
Good/Very Good condition: No holes or tears. Box has some whitening. Small white scratch in top right corner. Slight bowing on sides of top box. Minor crease bottom-right of bottom box. This is a thrift-store (charity shop) copy, so there is a price sticker on the side of the box.
COMPONENTS
Like New, but missing one small white die: This copy appears unplayed. Rulebook is crisp and clean. The map is pristine. The money is crisp and unworn. The cards for the companies is NEW and UNPUNCHED (though the perforation is partially separated in parts). Game board suggests a yellow player, but the pawn in the game is brown, and the disks for that colour are black (i.e. four black disks: two for brown and two for black), but this appears to be a manufacturer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s error, as all disks and pawns are the same make. 
BONUSES: Still has original Avalon Hill catalogue mailer slip, and registration card!</notes>

    <notes>Rail Baron, 1st edition. Box is in fair-good condition, shelfworn, marks were tape was placed and tear in one corner of box bottom. Contents are confirmed complete and in good-excellent condition. Condition of money seems to indicate the game was never actually played. One of the mounted maps has some slight age staining, but other than that the maps are in excellent condition (no warping). Rules have been read, but everything is there.
Please email me for a shipping quotation to your location and I will respond promptly!</notes>
