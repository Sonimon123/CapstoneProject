The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move.  The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Mayday Games (MYY4295)
Game by Dave Chalker, with a great concept and wonderful art done by Gavin Schmitt. Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values. The number on each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game! </notes>

    <notes>Game comes with the Pink robot and Shark-spansion. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also included 6 wooden chicken leg tokens for the sharkspansion (a bit more thematic than the 6 red cubes originally included, tho I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve left those in too)
Finally the clear face stickers for the robots are also included.
Game only played once and is in great condition.
Postage/ shipping costs available on request.

    <notes>Mayday Games (MYY4309)
Game by Dave Chalker, with a great concept and wonderful art done by Gavin Schmitt. Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values. The number on each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!</notes>

You don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to be faster than the shark, just faster than your friends!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Get Bit! is a card game where players are competing to stay alive as the others are being eaten by the shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values. The number on each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table.
