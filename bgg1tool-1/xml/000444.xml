   <description>Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hugo the ghost starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for Hugo's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Hugo, Hugo moves. This means that with more players in the game, Hugo moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once Hugo has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fright points_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; from your score. As Hugo catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;earns_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

It is fine, I just want to make sure we can communicate and all the details are worked out.  Also if you are outside the USA you need to pay with Paypal.  I like helping people find games, but I just want to make sure the transaction will work out well.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Midnight Party
Description: Midnight Party from Ravensburger used/complete. Components are all in great shape except rules which are a copy. Also includes variant rules. Box is a bit worn, but is still fully intact (no split corners).
Shipping Weight: 3 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>This is the 2013 German edition of Midnight Party that was never released in English. The artwork is MUCH better than the old versions and also includes an additional ruleset that is different than regular Midnight Party. The board is double sided to play each version.  Opened, but never played.  English rules in color are available right here on BGG for download and printing.  Will include a B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;W print out.
Can do local pick up in southern NH or eastern MA.</notes>
