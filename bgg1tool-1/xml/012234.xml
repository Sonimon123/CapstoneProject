    <notes>Unpunched. Contents verified complete and in like new condition. Its big. Its bad. Its OCS. And its the desert. You know you want to set this one up. You will stare at it in awe. Your wife and kids will think you are nuts. The box is square and straight with no dings or doinks.  One very small corner crease on the lid - neglible. Some edge wear on the bottom panel.  Maybe a hint of corner rubbing. Worldwide shipping and will be packed well. All forms of negotiable instruments considered. Bring me your finest meats and cheeses.  Combine ship with multiple purchases.

    <notes>I never played this game. This game is in mint condition and unpunched.
The only thing I did with this game is laminate the maps (see pictures).
The game is in excellent condition and stored in a non-smoking area.
The price does not include shipping. Since the maps are laminated....I recommend it be sent separately in a tube which will increase the shipping costs.
If you live close to Toronto, we can meet to avoid shipping costs.</notes>

I would rate this game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; except that it is punched.  All counters are carefully punched, counted, and organized in small baggies.  Game is complete.  All maps and rulebooks are like new.  I purchased this game new and never played it.  Non-smoking home with no pets.  Two back corners of box had very small wrinkles when I bought it (see photos).</notes>
