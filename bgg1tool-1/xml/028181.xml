   <description>Combat Commander:Pacific is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. CC:P's main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Imperial Japan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;CC:P is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series. While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Banzai attacks;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;BARs and Thompson SMGs;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Beach landings _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; river crossings;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hidden movement;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Caves;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scouts;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Aircraft;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Bayonets;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mortar spotting;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Treetop snipers;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reconnoitering._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters).

Radios _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and individual weapons larger than a rifle _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; are represented by their own counters.

The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s board edge._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Orders_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Actions_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Events_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and die roll _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Triggers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; both good and bad _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s perfect plan._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;CC:P includes twelve maps featuring terrain specific to the PTO._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;CC:P's playbook includes:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    twelve scenarios._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Pacific version of the Random Scenario Generator utilizing the new maps and nationalities.

Note:
Assuming the buyer is willing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to complete all paperwork required by the BGG Market Place on the day of purchase and have the item packed and shipped on the next working day.
Postage within the UK will by courier (3-5 working days) as the item weighs over 2Kg  unless otherwise agreed with a charge of £4.99 for this item. 
If you want to make multiple purchases contact me and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate postage.
I will ship items to Europe, price to be agreed on request. On items under 2Kg postage can still be quite reasonable. It gets more expensive if a courier has to be used.
Thanks for looking.
Barry

    <notes>GMT Games (GMT0811)
Combat Commander:Pacific is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. CC:Pacific_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family: Imperial Japan, and the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps, and the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces. CC:Pacific is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series. While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s basic rules, CC:Pacific includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This will slightly ramp up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include: Banzai attacks, BARs and Thompson SMGs, Beach landings _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; river crossings, Hidden movement, Caves, Scouts, Aircraft, Bayonets, Mortar spotting, Reconnoitering. </notes>

    <notes>Condition: New in Shrink. You can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find a more pristine condition than this!
Shipping: the price I pay to Canada Post, FedEx, or UPS (your choice of company and method) is the price you pay. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge extra for handling or packing materials. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere in the world (yes, that includes Brazil)... but all buyers should be aware that I assume no liability for parcels when they leave my hands. Insurance recommended, particularly for international buyers.
Payment: I am an L5R addict, and I typically buy my booster boxes through CoolStuffInc, so I would prefer a CSI Gift Certificate. If the buyer would prefer, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also accept Paypal, provided the buyer covers any fee that may apply.
Miscellaneous: BGG will receive its 3%, of course. Item will ship within 3 days of payment clearing. Any questions, please feel free to PM!</notes>

FYI: Game is new and in original shrink, Box does have a minor corner ding with some shrink wrap torn and a crease on the box bottom. All are minor and cosmetic only.
