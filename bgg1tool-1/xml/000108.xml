   <description>The hexagonal board has several holes in it for the unique playing pieces.  Each player uses sand timers as his pieces, and a turn is simply to move to an adjacent space, flipping the timer in the process.  The number of times that each space on the board can be occupied is limited, but the more central spaces can have more traffic.  The object of the game is simply to have any of your pieces movable when your opponent's pieces are either locked in place, or out of sand._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game was originally part of project GIPF._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Notes:
1.  There is some minor creasing on the lid near one of the corners (ask if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like me to send you a picture).
2.  Internal components are in perfect condition.
Shipping will be roughly the cost of a 3.5-lb package from 48104 to your zip code via either USPS (Priority or Parcel) or FedEx Home/Ground.</notes>

All games are in excellent condition being in slightly played status.  If you have any questions feel free to ask!
If you are interested in purchasing multiple games, or the entire collection let me know and I will combine shipping for all games.

    <notes>My copy of this game has been played a few times, but is in great condition.  I actually had two sets, and took the six most accurate timers from both to combine into this set that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m now selling.  Enjoy!
I also have other Gipf series games for sale, including Punct and Zertz.
SHIPPING: Once you provide me with your zip code (or country), I will charge you actual shipping cost from my location. Within the U.S., I can ship by Priority Mail (2 days) or Parcel Post (3-7 days), whichever you prefer. If you buy more than one game from me, I will be happy to combine shipping.
PAYMENT: I accept money orders, cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks, and Paypal.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original edition, in the larger box. It was played once, and all the components are in excellent condition. The box has minor indentation. The rulebook includes English. 
In addition to the game, some GIPF potentials are included: 3 TAMSK potentials (now TZAAR potentials), 9 ZÈRTZ potentials, and 6 DVONN potentials. The TAMSK/TZAAR potentials were included in the game, the others are from other sets (they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re extras, which is why I am including them here).</notes>

    <notes>Schmidt Spiele International (including English rules) edition.
This copy is out of shrink but does not appear to have ever been played because the 64 ivory rings are still in a sealed bag.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included a pic of the box top as there are a couple of imho minor imperfections... notice on the right edge 1/2 way down.. the paper is I want to describe as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wrinkled_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Over on the lower edge is a small depression that looks like another game box may have pushed against it.  And at the top above the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;T_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; looks like a small scratch.  Minor imho but I include the pic as your opnion may differ.</notes>
