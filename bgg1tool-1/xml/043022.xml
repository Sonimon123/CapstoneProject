   <description>Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Yomi is the Japanese word for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;reading_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;guess_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;just random,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Yomi (second edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Hi there!
Up for sale is Yomi Complete First Edition. I have limited closet space and need to sell some games. These are games that are in near-new condition, played only once, and just didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t click with my gaming group. They come from a smoke-free, adult home with no kids and no pets. I take absolute meticulous care of all my board games. I do not allow friends to eat and drink while playing these games. Hopefully they can find a home in your inventory where they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be played and loved :)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGG, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much feedback, but you can check my eBay account (x.metal), which has over 820 feedback with no negatives. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping for multiple items.
Send me a geekmail if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!</notes>

Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).</notes>

    <notes>Complete First Edition.  
Lum, degrey, rock, and jaina decks are sealed.
The other 6 decks have been opened, but have only been played a handful of times. The cards are still in excellent condition. The boxes each deck is stored in have started to show only the slightest of wear at the corners.
Playing mats are like a mousepad material, and they are in great condition. They have been rolled up for a while, but they lay flat after unfurling.
The box everything is stored in has started to show shelf wear.
In my estimation, you couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for a better second hand copy of this game.
Shipping will be $15 in the US.  </notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling an almost new copy of Yomi Complete First Edition.  My wife and I tried it out, and while I loved it, she wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a big fan.  We played 5 or 6 games total.  One of the decks is still in its plastic.  Enclosed will be the box, all 10 decks, the two playmats, the 4 tokens, and the instructions.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>This is for the complete First Edition.  Only four of the decks were opened, each played only once.  The rest are in shrink and the mats are still in the plastic!
Also included is the Cursed set of cards as a free bonus!
Buyer will pay actual USPS shipping costs.  This game weighs about four pounds.  If you live in the Western Mass area and want to pick it up from me to save on shipping, that would be fine.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>Sirlin Games (SRN YM01)
 
Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a battle between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character and can also be used as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork. Grave is careful and in control. His Dragonheart attack is tied for the fastest in the game. Sometimes he can look at your hand cards, other times he counters whatever you tried to do. His sister Jaina, by contrast, is fiery and reckless. She can damage herself to buyback her attacks, and to change her mind mid-combat in desperate situations. </notes>

    <notes>This is virtually new. The playing mats have not been touched so they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re still sealed and in perfect condition, the box is in Like New condition with no rips or corner wear. Only THREE of the ten decks have been opened and played with once, the other 7 are sealed up tight.
Honestly, I bought this game while in some kind of buying frenzy and I only ever played it the one time when I brought it home. Id be happy to see it go to a home that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get played at and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m discounting it 25% from the new price for the fact that it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not in shrink. Honestly though, this is about as new as you can get for a savings of $25, shipping is $15 and includes delivery confirmation. Total is $90 for Yomi shipped! Local pickup available. </notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling a complete first edition set of David Sirlin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s phenomenal card game Yomi. It simulates the tactical action of one-on-one fighting games such as Street Fighter and it is designed beautifully. In fact, the only reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it, is because I lack people to play it with! 
My game is in near mint condition and complete with the two rubber play mats, life counters and 10 character decks. I will consider shipping it world wide, but I prefer keeping it within Europe to keep the shipping costs low. Shipping within Europe will be between 20 and 30 euros depending on added insurance, tracking and the country (to the U.S. it will be a bit higher). Of course I will try to minimize additional customs charges if possible.
Please contact me with any questions, or to make a serious counter offer. If you are located in The Netherlands, picking it up would also an option.</notes>

The game is opened, but hardly played. I could sell it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; (no bends, no chipped corners, etc.). Cursed cards included.
European buyers: PM me for bank transfer, or if you want to collect the game yourself.
I like the game, but when I play it, I play it online. I have no friends who are interested in playing this game face to face a lot.</notes>

    <notes>Sirlin Games (SRNYM04)
Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a battle between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character and can also be used as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork. Valerie is a painter with emotional highs and lows. She_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pretty good at drawing cards and keeping the pressure up. She can also get an extra burst of speed when she needs it the most. Geiger is a precise and logical watchmaker and a scientist who has time-bending abilities. He can stack his deck and save up for a really huge combo that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s immune to the opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s combo escapes.</notes>

You get ten decks in their deckboxes + Cursed cards for all 10 characters + 2 playmats + 4 plastic hit point tokens (2 blue, 2 red) + rulebook + game box =_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; In other words the complete 1st edition.

    <notes>This is for the Complete First Edition.
This set has been played quite a bit and so the box show notable wear (see pictures), but luckily the card quality in this game is high so the cards remain in pretty great condition (also some decks have been used a lot less than others)
This is the Complete First Edition, and is 100% complete, including the two fancy playmats which are hard to find right now-- they are not currently in the recently released Second Edition and so this Complete First Edition remains the only way to find them.
If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t currently own Yomi, some _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Upgrade Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; are currently listed for sale from the manufacturer on his website (sirlingames.com) if you want to bring the gameplay of these decks to second edition standard (though some aesthetic differences will remain)
If you already own Yomi second edition, then you can buy this for the playmats, and the duplicate character decks can be used for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;mirror matches_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (where multiple players can play the same character)
PayPal only. Buyer pays shipping, and will ship to the United States. I will charge flat rate $10 shipping and handling, which according to my estimates is I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve done via USPS is actually lower than the true cost for the 4 lbs 7 oz package sent v ia Standard Post.

Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a battle between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character and can also be used as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork. Lum is a gambling panda who loves randomness. While he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fighting, he also tries to make poker hands to sneak in extra damage and effects. He gets random boosts every time he deals damage with an attack, as well. Argagarg is a wise water shaman, with a patient style. Though his combos are weak, his hex grinds you down every turn whether he hits you or not.</notes>

    <notes>The Complete First Edition of Yomi. It includes all ten original fighters and the neoprene playmats with lifetrackers.  In the few decks I looked at, cards look like they haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played.  
For those who are anal like me, the back of the box says it has a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;comprehensive rule book._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;  This is not in here, not sure if it ever actually came with it but it has rule sheets with each deck AND a print off of a rules summary, which from what I can tell here on the geek is better than the original _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;comprehensive_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; rule book.
