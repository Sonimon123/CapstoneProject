   <description>In Crude: The Oil Game, players take on the role of oil company CEOs, seeking to expand their companies into multi-national energy mega-corporations.  Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board!  Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets... again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets.  The first player to reach a corporation value of $750 million is the winner!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Crude: The Oil Game is not only a great simulation of the global oil markets, but with almost 300 plastic playing pieces, it is a sight to behold!  Known as McMulti when it was printed in Europe almost 25 years ago, this great game is finally back in print after many years!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Brought back into print in 2012 by Stronghold Games, Crude: The Oil Game has been a highly sought-after (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Grail_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;) game. This is an early Euro-style game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; before Euro-style existed! _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; which accurately simulates the market forces and elements of the oil and gasoline markets at all levels of production, including oil drilling, oil pumping, oil and gasoline buying and selling in the domestic and foreign markets, oil refining, and finally gasoline selling to the consumer._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the Hexagames version.
One corner of the box could do with taping (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not completely ripped, but will need care!) and one corner of the lid is slightly crumpled. On the opposite corner, there is a slight rip along the fold: the sides have not separated. Two of the lid sides _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; a bit. The pieces, money, board and cards are all in excellent shape. If not for the box, it would rate as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
I can supply pics for prospective buyers who might want to check the state of the box before making a decision.</notes>

    <notes>The box and components are excellent.  This was a non-English edition.  Game has a photocopy of English rules.  For the News Cards and the Situation cards, I went to Kinko_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and photocopied the English cards onto colored card stock. I also corrected the two incorrect prices on the Expansion Card prior to copying.  So this set is German ready and English ready.</notes>

    <notes>McMulti by Hexagames in really great condition!  Looks pretty much unplayed, all components are in brand new condition.  I have painstakingly inventoried everything, and there may be one black barrel of 100 missing, but everything else is present, even the 100 blue barrels.  The money is pristine and does not look ever played with.  
The only thing keeping this from brand new condition is some box wear.  There is some slight discoloration on the box lid, and it looks like there was a round price sticker placed on the lid, and it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t taken off super well.  The corners show minor wear, but no rips or tears.  
All components are in English and German, including the rules.
Please ask for pictures if you have any concerns.  I will only charge actual shipping by USPS Priority Mail from Zip Code 09139.  Insurance will be provided for, but not charged to you.</notes>

    <notes>Square Hexagames edition. Box shows heavy shelf wear and was taped on every corner. Board, pieces, money and cards are OK, the german rules are there, but have been marked severly. And the game smells like it have been in cellars for decades...
This is by no means a pristine copy! If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for one to play with - that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s OK, go ahead. BUT NOT FOR COLLECTORS!

    <notes>I must stress that this is the original version of the game - CRUDE - which is, of course, far more rare than McMULTI and so must, I guess, be regarded as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; item.
I have stated the condition as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; because the curious box that housed this game (resembling a large book) was never the most robust of items even when new! It has been on my shelves ever since I bought it new and the contents are in excellent condition.  I will gladly send photos if requested.</notes>

    <notes>This game can be played, but I am selling it to be used for spare parts and nicely laminated english components. I was sold this game (the McMulti edition) without being told that it had the board that was a misprint. But all of the pieces are in great condition. And I made player aids, commercial cards, economic situation cards and a state of the economy chart in english and had them professionaly laminated. The game can also be played, but 2 of the charts on the board are mislabeled. There is a thread on BGG telling you how they should be labeled. Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG2004)
In Crude: The Oil Game, players take on the role of oil company CEOs, seeking to expand their companies into multi-national energy mega-corporations. Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board! Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets...again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area! However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets. The first player to reach a corporation value of $750 million is the winner! Crude: The Oil Game is not only a great simulation of the global oil markets, but with almost 300 plastic playing pieces, it is a sight to behold! Known as McMulti when it was printed in Europe almost 25 years ago, this great game is finally back in print after many years! </notes>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG2004)
In Crude: The Oil Game, players take on the role of oil company CEOs, seeking to expand their companies into multi-national energy mega-corporations. Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board! Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets...again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area! However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets. The first player to reach a corporation value of $750 million is the winner! Crude: The Oil Game is not only a great simulation of the global oil markets, but with almost 300 plastic playing pieces, it is a sight to behold! Known as McMulti when it was printed in Europe almost 25 years ago, this great game is finally back in print after many years! </notes>
