   <description>This simulation game re-creates one of the longest, most complex, and least understood conflicts in US history in all of its military and political aspects._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rules include detailed treatment of movement, terrain, search and destroy operations, special operations, firepower, air mobility, riverines, brigade-level formations, limited intelligence and auxiliary units in each scenario.  The scenarios start out small with Operation Starlite, and slowly build in complexity, introducing more rules, until the entire Campaign Scenario which covers the entire war from 1965 to 1975 and introduces South Vietnamese politics, morale and commitment, strategic bombing, reinforcements, and pacification._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unit counters are Battalion and Regiment size._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Unpunched and complete.  Beautiful copy, the only flaws here are a razor thin scratch on the lid right down the middle and a few of the counters have fallen off the sprues (That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a sign of good counters!  It minimizes the fraggies big time).
Email me at danger-mouse@comcast.net with any questions.

    <notes>Punched, complete (except for missing the 5 blank counters).  There is some light highlighting in the rules.  Everything is in very good condition.  NOTE: Vietnam 1965-1975 normally comes with two paper mapsheets.  The previous owner nicely mounted those mapsheets on eight mounted map board, a size similar to the ones used in AH_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Squad Leader.  Because of this, the game is much heavier and will not fit in the bookcase-style game box.  (The box will still be included)</notes>

All game materials are present, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve counted the counters and there are 780.  Rule book is the most worn aspect of this game having been thoroughly reviewed.  Its a paper map, so obviously bends at the folds but still in very good shape.
Shipping is $8 to Eastern and Central US and $10 to Mountain and Pacific areas.  All other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>OK, the game is complete, and mostly unpunched.  Those counters that have fallen out of the trees are accounted for and stored in the game tray.  I will transfer those to a zip lock prior to shipping.  The box is structurally intact, but suffers from improper stacking.  The real heartache with the game is that it suffers from old storage disease.  If you are looking for a complete copy and can overlook it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s faults, this copy will do fine.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for a pristine collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, please do not buy this copy.</notes>

    <notes>Game is 99% complete, missing 7 out of 780 counters as follows:
2 x US OPS / COMP markers (of 70)
3 x US / allied combat units (of 230)
1 x S. Vietnamese (of 167)
1 x N.Vietnamese (of 172)
All other game counters are present. Counter scans are available here on BGG to check which exact units are missing and to make replacements. 
The game is otherwise in good, used condition with counters punched, sorted and bagged. The rule book is well read, but no marking / writing and the mapboard is in very good condition. The box has some wear and creasing and one repaired corner.

    <notes>Punched and sorted in tray. All components in near new condition. Game looks to never have been played.
Will ship in first class or priority box for $10 to U.S. addresses. $18 to Canada. $30 international.
I will combine shipping if you purchase other games at the same time. Magazines and non-boxed games can usually fit in the same box so no additional charge. I will send you a postage total on multiple game orders before confirming your order. Iâ€™ve rarely had any issues with loss or damage but U.S. post office does not track first class packages once they leave the U.S. so foreign buyers assume all risk of loss or damage.

    <notes>Game is complete and mostly unpunched.  There is significant counter fallout - 41 counters have fallen from the sheets, and oddly enough, there are 45 counters included in the countertray.  7 yellow counters have fallen out and are all included, and 34 green counters are out of the sheet, and there are 38 green counters in the countertray.  I have counted everything three times and those are the totals I get every time.  Please contact me with specific questions and I will attempt to answer them.  Additionally the game includes two Victory insiders featuring the game, and a large number of copies of the record sheets.</notes>

    <notes>This sale is for one copy of the Vietnam 1965-1975 board game. Never played and 100% complete with playing pieces and map in excellent condition...some pieces still unpunched. The box has shelf wear and staining as shown. Please look at the photos and ask questions if you have them.
Buyers, especially new users, unless it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t matter to you, please contact me for shipping quotes BEFORE adding to cart. I only charge what USPS.com will quote me for the actual weight of the game and packing materials.   It is extreme impolite to add a game to the cart and then never paying because you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like the postage.  I leave negative and/or neutral feedback in that case.
Please be aware if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in on the Eastern Time Zone, shipping will be higher due to USPS policies regarding postal zones.</notes>

    <notes>All components in very good condition.   Counters unpunched.  Never played.  Box shows its age.
Shipping costs extra. Shipping from Maryland (21146). Will ship worldwide but note that it will be expensive (better to have someone receive it for you in the U.S.)
Shipping costs can be combined if you purchase other items that I am selling.
PayPal for payment. USPS for shipment.
If you are outside the U.S., please add 2 percent of the total (to include shipping costs) to cover the extra PayPal fees.</notes>
