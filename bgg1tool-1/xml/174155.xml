   <description>Lignum is a game about the logging industry in the 19th century. As a woodcutter, your task is to prevail against your competitors and collect the most money after two years. Lignum (Latin for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;wood_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;) is a game for lovers of complex strategy games. After cutting and transporting your wood, don't think your job is finished. You'll still have to optimize your entire processing chain - and have fun doing it!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each of the eight rounds always begins with the cutting of trees. If your supply lines are set up and the timber has been approved for felling, then the players claim an area using secretly selected cards. Since each of the areas contain differing amounts of food and wood, players must learn to recognize and adapt to their opponent's strategies because if two players are both in the same area, they must share the resources. Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood. Because in the end, this business is all about money, and whoever can make the most wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Opened but un-played. Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags.  I ship via USPS, which is most cost effective. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. Shipping from 98012.
Here’s some shipping ESTIMATES to help you get an idea of what it will cost. Your distance from my Zip Code (98012) and box weight are the biggest factors in price. Please ask ahead of time if you want to know your shipping! If you place an order and cancel it after I provide you with shipping, you will get negative feedback. 
Small Card Game (i.e. 6 nimmt or Hanabi) $3-$6  / USPS First Class or Priority Bubble Mailer 
Thin Medium Sized  (i.e. Concept, Las Vegas) $8-$10 / Priority Mail
Thick Medium Sized (i.e. Istanbul, King of Tokyo, Russian Railroads) $10-$13 / Priority Mail
Big Box Games (i.e. Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders) $16-$18 / Priority Mail or Parcel Post
Oversized or Odd Shaped Boxes ($22-$25) / Parcel Post</notes>
