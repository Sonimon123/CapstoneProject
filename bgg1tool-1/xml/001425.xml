   <description>This solitaire wargame simulates the March 28, 1942, British raid on the Nazi-occupied French port of St. Nazaire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the first part of the game, the player moves the British boats and destroyer HMS Campbeltown (camouflaged as a German ship) to their landing areas, while determining the results of the many shots from the harbor defense guns.  Upon landing, the remaining force tries to reach targets  (sub pens, caissons, docked ships, supply tanks, etc.) and destroy them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The German guards are handled by the game system and arrive via random draw and placement and move by most direct route to the nearest British commando.  As the game progresses, the German units get tougher and better organized._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game ends when either all British units are killed or escape and they score for the targets destroyed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>***********
NOTE: Condition-wise, this is in very good condition.  But the missing counters will need to be replaced in order to make the game work as designed.  At minimum, you will need to replace the 6 missing German counters to make it play as designed, though in theory the game could be played with the incorrect mix, since you would be missing no more than 2 from a specific Alarm Level.
***********
Missing: the three colored six-sided dice and 17 counters (see below).  The rulebook is crisp, there are plenty of sheets left on the game log pad, and the three-piece board is in very good condition.  The box shows light to moderate wear, mostly around the corners.
What counters are missing and how important are they?
***SCALE***
A - You really need this counter!
B - Necessary, but you can probably do with a substitute
C - Necessary, but you definitely can do with a substitute
D - Noticeable if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have it, but passable.
E - Not terribly important
1 x British Commando, Moss (B)
2 x Artillery Battery, 121 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 311 (A/B)
3 x Sunk/Withdrawn (E)
1 x Dockside Defensive Fire (C)
2 x Damaged/Destroy (E)
2 x Prepared Charges/Charges at Risk (D)
6 x German Strosstruppen (A, these are the strength chits pulled from the cup to randomize the opposition)</notes>

    <notes>The box is in excellent condition - very minor scuff marks on edges. The game is in perfect condition - punched, but never played. The rating of good is related to yellow highlight and underlining of key rules in the rulebook. The rulebook is in perfect condition outside these markings, and they do not prevent reading - in fact may be useful to new players. Shipping will be actual based on how the buyer wants the games shipped.</notes>

    <notes>Box is in good condition.  Some shelf wear, mostly on the bottom of the box, but no tears.  Game is complete.  Most chits are in great condition with hardly any wear at all.  Board is in great condition very minor damage to one corner of one board (and quite beautiful!).  Rules included and not tears or markings.  Still includes a lot (~30?) of untouched sheets of the Game Log.  Original advertisement still in box as well (for those of you who like utter completeness of these older games!).  I can take a picture or two to prove/show quality if requested.  
And a great game to boost! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just not a solitaire gamer.  </notes>

Game was purchased directly from Avalon Hill right before they were bought out by Hasbro; it was sent without shrink wrapped and taped on the side. There is slight tape residue on the side of box and sticker residue by the UPC bar code.  Also on the box cover is a sticker _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For Ages 8 And Up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  placed by Avalon Hill (part of their effort to get games into _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;non-gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; stores)

My late husband was an avid board game collector/player.  He collected almost 1600 games, not all have been played.   If they were played, no food or drinks were allowed by the games during play.   He took excellent care of all his games.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

    <notes>Raid on St. Nazaire by Avalon Hill, unpunched and near mint condition. This is a 1st Edition. The only difference between 1st _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 2nd editions was a couple of rules clarifications that were listed in The General magazine on the game.  I could easily include those changes on an errata sheet if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like. All components are the same between editions.
S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H to the US would be $15.00. Please ask about international shipping costs.
