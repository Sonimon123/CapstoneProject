   <description>Panzergruppe Guderian is a simulation of the German campaign to capture Smolensk in July, 1941.  The game is played in twelve turns, each one representing 2 days time, on a map scale of 10.5 km/hex._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is famous for its innovative use of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;untried_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Soviet units.  These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.

    <notes>This simulation has unique characteristics that make it well worth playing, even solitaire:  
-the strength of Soviet units is unknown until combat (see 4th photo below), i.e., the front side of a unit counter shows a ? for strength, the reverse side the actual strength.
-German unit strength is doubled if ALL units from a division are stacked together, applies to both attack _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; defense.
-German units are step-reduced in strength as a result of combat; that is, German infantry divisions have four steps (9-7, 4-7, 2-7, 1-7, then eliminated); German panzer, motorized, mechanized, and cavalry units have two steps to elimination (front and back of the same unit counter).
-either German or Russian units can conduct an overrun, which halves their attack strength but, if successful,lets them keep moving forward.
-Soviet leader units have leadership ratings, with 3 effects: 1.supply radius, thus that Soviet units outside the radius of a leader unit cannot move or attack; 2.combat bonus, thus a leader unit adds its strength to the combat strength of the units it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s stacked with; 3.the defensive combat strength of the leader unit on its own.
-other characteristics include rail movement for Soviets only, movement restrictions on Soviet units in early turns, disrupted units caused by overruns, German air interdiction and Soviet partisan interdiction.
Panzergruppe Guderian is a regimental/divisional level simulation of the German drive to cross the Dnepr River in the summer of 1941 and seize the valuable communications junctions at Smolensk in preparation for the final push towards Moscow.  (from the rules Introduction)
Much of the current historical writing about the German invasion of the USSR focuses on the apparent death struggle in front of Moscow.  The more profound and fundamental reasons for the German failure thereby tend to be obscured.  This article will show that the Barbarossa Offensive was doomed to failure by the interaction of the plans laid before the invasion and certain decisions taken during the month of August 1941.  (from the magazine, page 4)
Thus this package of simulation and magazine form a very interesting tool to study the question above.  The game itself is intact, units, map, and rules, as per the scans below. I played it solitaire a few times, and then stored it carefully until now, 33 years later (!).
Strategy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Tactics nr.57 of July/August 1976 in included in this offer.  The major article is of course the Smolensk campaign, with other articles on Rolling Thunder, Invasion America, and the Russian Civil War, all worth reading.</notes>
