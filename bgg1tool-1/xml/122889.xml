   <description>The City-State of Tempest is a lively metropolis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; some say the largest in the world _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; yet behind the city's cultured exterior, age-old cabals vie for power, fighting one another for dominance in a society ripe with political and economic turmoil. Led by shadowy figures who command a small cadre of loyal followers, these secret societies work in concert to seize the wealth and power of the fabled City-State of Tempest._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Dominare, you are the puppet master of a conspiracy seeking to control Tempest. Agents are the key to Dominare. Use your agents to spread your influence through the city, building a network of hidden power to control the most valuable districts and blocks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, players first draft agents they want. Then, each turn, the players reveal one additional layer of their conspiracy. Each agent is a unique person in the City-State of Tempest, with unique abilities. The higher an agent in in your conspiracy, the more powerful that agent is._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players spread their influence in key city blocks and districts, use agent and district abilities to further their plans, and manipulate the board to their benefit. Use your agents well, and influence and power will be yours. Use them poorly, and... well, you wouldn't be the first would-be ruler to vanish into the inky waters of the city canals...._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Number 3 in the Tempest Shared World Game Series_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

From the busy, rugged quays of the Merchant Quarter to the ornate magnificence of the Great Basilica, from the imperious chambers of the Senate to the stinking, crowded alleys of the Swamp, secret cabals move unseen in the City-State of Tempest. These clandestine societies, bound by blood oaths and driven by power, conspire to seize control of Tempest. They wage a secret war with words, gold, and a knife in a darkened alley. When it is won, few will be wiser as to who really pulls the strings in this great city.... Dominare is a game of the hidden war for total control of Tempest. The weapons of this war are people, and Dominare provides dozens of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;weapons_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for you to wield. Use your agents to build a conspiracy, and watch it grow in power as you add to it. Agents spread influence through eight city districts each with unique advantages, and use your agents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; abilities to wrest control of key parts of the city from the opposition... for in the end, control is all that matters. </notes>

From the busy, rugged quays of the Merchant Quarter to the ornate magnificence of the Great Basilica, from the imperious chambers of the Senate to the stinking, crowded alleys of the Swamp, secret cabals move unseen in the City-State of Tempest. These clandestine societies, bound by blood oaths and driven by power, conspire to seize control of Tempest. They wage a secret war with words, gold, and a knife in a darkened alley. When it is won, few will be wiser as to who really pulls the strings in this great city.... Dominare is a game of the hidden war for total control of Tempest. The weapons of this war are people, and Dominare provides dozens of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;weapons_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for you to wield. Use your agents to build a conspiracy, and watch it grow in power as you add to it. Agents spread influence through eight city districts each with unique advantages, and use your agents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; abilities to wrest control of key parts of the city from the opposition... for in the end, control is all that matters. </notes>
