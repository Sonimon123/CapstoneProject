Tanto Cuore is a deck building card game for 2 - 4 players.
 
The players take the roles of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;masters of the house_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, employ a lot of cute maids, and are served by them while slowly filling out their house (card deck).
 
But take care. The maids can become sick, or get bad habits!
 
When the game ends, the player who has the best collection of maids and therefore the most victory points is the perfect master and winner of the game!
 
All cards and the rulebook are in English.
- Note: Tanto Cuore means _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Much heart_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in Italian. </notes>

A deck-building card game fresh from Japan! Each player plays as the Lord of a mansion and hires maids to fill out their house to become the King of Maids! The end goal is simple enough, the player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins! Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s acquire Victory Points by employing a variety of maids and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Love_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards that allow for different strategies. You can even employ Private Maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn! Some give you a bonus, or affect your opponents in a negative way. But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points! The game art is in the Japanese anime style and uses the theme of maids commonly seen in anime! All of the cards, dividers and manual fit into an easy to transport box so you can easily take the game with you wherever you want. </notes>

Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it).

Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Japanime Games (JPG001)
Tanto Cuore is a deck building card game for 2 - 4 players. The players take the roles of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;masters of the house_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, employ a lot of cute maids, and are served by them while slowly filling out their house (card deck). But take care. The maids can become sick, or get bad habits! When the game ends, the player who has the best collection of maids and therefore the most victory points is the perfect master and winner of the game!</notes>
