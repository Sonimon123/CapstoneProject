   <description>Victory in the Pacific is a simple strategic wargame covering the Pacific Theater of WW2.  It is a successor to the system developed in War at Sea which covers the Battle of the Atlantic._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game divides the Pacific into 13 sea areas.  Each turn the players move their ships, land based air and marines from the ports and bases (which are located on the borders of sea areas) to one of the areas._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Ships can either be patrollers  (the only ships that will take control of area after battle, but they must commit their move first) or raiders._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After all ships have been moved, the players dice off determine whether a day battle (where air power is decisive) or night battle (when ship board gunnery rules) is fought.  After a number of rounds, until one side or the other retreats or loses all of his ships, the player with patrolling ships left takes control of the area and a scores a number of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Points of Control_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Japanese will almost always take a large lead that will be inevitably turned back by the Americans as they get large numbers of carriers as the game goes on._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Avalon Hill Complexity Rating - 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Contains the box, two part board, six diece, two reinforcement sheets, rulebook and all of the counters. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s everything the game is supposed to have.
Box has wear, crushing and some clear tape on the corners but is very functional. The map, rules, a few counters and reinforcement sheets have variant rules written on them (maybe from The General? I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure), though they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect play of the original game. The rules and a few counters have some small stains. 
Payment via PayPal or USPS money order. Shipping is $12. Combine shipping on multiple games.</notes>

    <notes>MISSING ALL COUNTERS
This would be a copy for replacing box, boards, charts or rulebook.  It is not playable as there are no counters.
Box is in pretty good shape:  one split corner on lid, slight dishing of lid, one crease on lid, shelf-wear all around.
Boards are beautiful. They look unused.
Both Order of Appearance charts are crisp and also look unused.
The Second Edition Rulebook is in excellent shape.
MISSING ALL COUNTERS
I would probably be willing to break up parts to save on shipping.  We can negotiate a price for individual components.
I am always willing to trade or negotiate.</notes>

This game is one of a vast collection my brother had acquired as a enthusiastic wargamer.
Please contact me if you require any information, I will try my best to answer your questions.
Thankyou for looking.
From _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Avalon Hill General Index and Company History, 1952-1980_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Victory in the Pacific (1977)
Designed by Richard Hamblen
A sister game to WAR AT SEA, this version added much sophistication while maintaining the simple game mechanics which made WAS so popular. The elements of carrier warfare and island hopping are excellently portrayed in a very playable game system.

All counters are in very good condition, punched, all present and complete with no visible wear.
If required, I could also supply copies of the other components ( 2 order of battle cards, rule book, and copied game boards) if someone wants to put together a cheap set.</notes>

    <notes>All of the pieces and control markers are present and correct. A number of the damage markers are missing, but these have been ably replaced by colour printouts mounted on card which, in all honesty, look just like the original markers in play. There is a little wear on the earlier-appearing pieces (those that have seen most use) but this only adds to the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s character :) The later-appearing pieces are in excellent, unmarked condition. All original rules and charts are present and correct and the gameboard is in excellent, unmarked condition. The box is all there but all four corners of the lid and one of the base are split - a neat repair will hide it. </notes>

    <notes>The counters have been punched (very neatly) but show no signs of having been used for play.
The rulebook, OOB/Appearance cards and mapboard are in in as new condition. They have never been used.
The box is in very good shape, still sturdy, but there is a split on one corner of the top box.
Please contact me for shipping costs. I pack very safely/securely.

    <notes>This copy of the game has never been played.  It is no longer in shrinkwrap, but in excellent condition after all of these years.
The two counter sheets are present and unpunched.
Rules and map are in excellent shape.  Both Order of Appearance Charts are present.
As I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find a good game contents post on the Geek, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the box:
- Mounted Map
- Second Edition Rules
- Four Six-Sided Dice
- Two unpunched countersheets (joined together on one edge)
- Allied Order of Appearance Chart
- Japanese Order of Appearance Chart
The outside game box is in very good condition even after all of these years.  There are the beginning signs of wear and tear along the game box corners.  The long box top sides are starting to flare a bit.  And the box top is now a bit concave.  I think the box top was that way when I acquired it.
Game comes from a non-smoking house.
I can also add one copy (in Very Good+) condition of AH General magazine, Volume 19, Issue 6.  The issue has a number of Victory in the Pacific related articles.  Please GeekMail for details.</notes>

It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a bonus since W@S is far easier to acquire than VitP and as such the ratio is about 3 to 1 and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather give them away with the pac game instead of bothering selling it alone. Plus some articles for both titles from a variety of non-General sources that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll find interesting.</notes>
