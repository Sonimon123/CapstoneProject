    <notes>I have 1 Men of Hawksford Starter and 1 Orc Army Starter for sale. The price listed is for 1.  I will sell both for $13.  
I took the shrinkwrap off the cards in the Men set, but the cards are unplayed and in mint condition.  The cards in the Orc Army are still in the shrinkwrap.
Shipping costs based on weight and location - will probably be about $5 to ship.  Shipping to U.S. only.

**
Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is a point-based miniatures game – but without the miniatures. Battleground uses cards rather than painted models to represent your forces. This means a much lower price as well as easier transportation and setup, but don’t be fooled – this is not a “light” war game or a CCG. Battleground is a serious, award-winning wargame that will challenge you at every step, from army design and deployment to tactical maneuvers and command decisions until battle’s end.
What you Get
Each Battleground army comes in two different decks.
•    Army Starters contain eighteen unit cards, a thirty-card Command Deck and two quickstart reference cards, plus the basic rules. This gives you all the cards you need to get started – in play terms, each unit card is the equivalent of a boxed set of miniatures.
•    Army Reinforcement decks each contain fifty unit cards – enough for almost any army you can imagine – and the advanced rules.  Reinforcement decks also include two unit types not available in that army’s Starter. 
All you need in addition is a flat surface, an opponent, some dice and a couple of dry-erase markers.</notes>

Men of Hawkshold reinforcement deck
Orc Army starter deck
Orc Army reinforcement deck
Undead Army starter deck
Undead Army reinforcement deck
Lizardmen starter deck
Lizardmen reinforcement deck
I do not include the summary cards, as they are outdated anyway, but I will include 5 dry erase markers, 2 black, 1 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. All of the cards are in sleeves and have been since they were first opened. I have not even played the Lizardmen or Undead decks, and only played the Men and Orc decks a few times. I paid about $100 for the items. I would prefer to sell all of the decks at once.

    <notes>Played with once or twice, really only a few of the cards.  I have both the Rome vs Carthage Starter Pack, also the Rome vs Carthage Reinforcement pack.  So this is essentially everything this game offers at this time.
Both Games are complete, and in excellent condition, this listing is for both of them.  This would likely be quite cheap to ship as well.  In a padded envelope or small flat rate maybe.
Buyer prepays plus USPS priority mail shipping.  If I can find a different box, or you order many games, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to combine shipping or make a special trip to the post office for parcel post, but for just a couple games, or a single game, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to use the free boxes for priority mail.  
If we can beat flat rate depending upon your location, we will, but many times flat rate does tend to be the least expensive.

For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
