   <description>Downtown: Air War Over Hanoi, 1965-1972 is a game of air warfare over Hanoi. During the Rolling Thunder (1965-68) and Linebacker (1972) campaigns, Hanoi and the Red River Valley was the focus of American air operations intended to pressure North Vietnam's Communist leadership  into ceasing their attacks on the South. Against large _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;packages_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; of US attack and support aircraft, the Vietnamese deployed a formidable array of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). They also had a force of MiG fighter jets._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Covering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Packages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Iron Hand_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM . They can launch MiG fighters to intercept the bomber streams aimed at 'Downtown' Hanoi.

    <notes>Game is opened but unpunched.  Box has very minimal wear.  Over-all, the game is in great shape.  This game also includes the new counters and scenario from GMT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s C3i #17 as a bonus.  Shipping will be $8.60 for USPS Priority Mail or $4 for media mail for US continental delivery.  International shipping will probably be $15-$30, but you should message me for an exact quote.  Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>The game is missing the dice and baggies. Otherwise it is complete and 100% unpunched. The rulebook shows just a tad of handling wear from browsing. All other game components are in excellent crisp, clean condition. One crease on the map was folded in the opposite direction from the original fold from manufacturer. Box is good. Some small rub spots on the edges and a couple of small depressions. Otherwise still nice and square. Sale price does not include postage. Email for shipping quote from zip code 11365</notes>

    <notes>This sale includes BOTH Downtown: Air War over Hanoi (GMT 2004) and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s sequel Elusive Victory: The Air War over the Suez Canal (GMT 2009).
I bought both used and have frankly never played either one. Downtown is in wonderful condition inside and out. Elusive Victory has some minor box wear on the outside, but the components are still in exceptional condition. The printed materials in both are in terrific shape - neither shows any great signs of use. 
Buyer to pay shipping and paypal fees. 
Thanks for looking. 
(PS - I am also selling Bloody April as well - the more recent use of the same rules set in WWI France - someone may want to pick up all three in one swoop)</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m prepared to listen to an offer, and would be more likely to consider if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re buying several game. Low-ball offers are likely to be ignored.
*** All games on my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;For Trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; list will be listed eventually - feel free to look through them and make offers ***
Shipping is done from 33947 via USPS Priority or Ground service, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to keep your costs down using Flat-rate and Regional-rate boxes if that works out cheapest. If you want a rough estimate of the shipping cost use the calculator at usps.com. Total the weight of all the games, then add a lb or two for the box plus packing materials. I ship to mainland US addresses only. (A couple of bad experiences.)
Payments via personal PayPal transfers are preferred (extra charged for cover any fees), but checks, money orders, cash, and other options considered. 
Not looking for any trades at this point, but may consider 18xx games.</notes>

In addition it has a significant number of other printouts of articles about the game and strategy.  The box, however, is a bit of a mess.  It is pretty badly dished and has a number of related creases.  Also, one side is crushed like something heavy was stacked on the box.  Please see pictures for details.</notes>
