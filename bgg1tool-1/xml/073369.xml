Complete and in excellent condition. Box shows no wear. Cards show a touch of wear from a couple plays. Counters neatly sorted and bagged.

    <notes>Toy Vault, Inc. (TYV 26621)
The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed. And now, 30 years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country. Try to establish a new order. Try to control others. Create a new country, a new State: the 51st State.
51st State is a card game in which players control one of the four powers (mutants, traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians) and try to build their very own new country. Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.
Every card in 51st State can be put into play in three different ways. You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.

    <notes>Ich möchte mein 51st State verkaufen. Es wurde einige Male gespielt, ist aber in wirklich sehr gutem Zustand. Die in der Erstausgabe fehlenden Tokens hatte ich nachbestellt, diese liegen also auch bei. Alle Teile wurden in Zip-Tütchen verpackt. 
Ich verschicke nur innerhalb Deutschlands. Mein Vorschlag ist Hermes für 4 Euro, wenn eine andere Versandart gewünscht ist, lasse ich aber gerne mit mir reden.
Bezahlt werden kann entweder per PayPal oder Vorkasse-Überweisung.
Wenn Fragen sind, schreiben Sie mir. Bilder, sofern gewünscht, kann ich leider erst Montag machen.</notes>

Selling quite cheaply as we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re just interested in freeing up some shelf space.
Shipping is 2nd Class - £3.50. Shipping is a little high due to the weight.
Shipping to Europe - £8.00.

    <notes>Virtually new, only played once, mint condition.  Includes laminated reference sheet.  If there was a box insert I have discarded it.
There is a small Plano storage case that fits nicely in the box and nicely holds all of the tokens.  Please add $3 to your order if you want this, otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll switch everything to baggies.  Ask if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to see a picture.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.

    <notes>I am selling this game in order to make room on my shelves for games that might get played more often.  The components are all very well cared for. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve added a good bit of value, too! Read on for more.
Condition
---
The box and all components are in excellent condition.  The insert has been discarded to make room for the extras (see below).
Components
---
All game components and manuals are present and in perfectly pristine condition. Furthermore, the following extras are included:
-A really cool double-sided plano box to hold all tokens.
-Cards protected in Mayday premium sleeves.
-Cards sorted and bound into decks using non-adhesive Amazing Tape.
Shipping
---
I will ship this via USPS in a flat rate box (I think it will fit), to the USA only for $15. If you are outside of the US and really want this game, feel free to drop me a GM, and we can discuss it. I only hesitate because I rarely ship out of the country.  Free pickup available in Albuquerque, NM.
Closing Thoughts

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this item at a steep discount in order to get it out of my place and in to a better home where it might be played.</notes>

    <notes>Toy Vault (TYV26621)
The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed. And now, 30 years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country. Try to establish a new order. Try to control others. Create a new country, a new State: the 51st State. 51st State is a card game in which players control one of the four powers (mutants, traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians) and try to build their very own new country. Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills. Every card in 51st State can be put into play in three different ways. You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.</notes>

    <notes>Played this a few times. There is some shelf wear on the game box, but no damage noted to the game itself. I wrote the publisher and got extra tokens that were missing from the first printing of the game.
Shipping outside the U.S. is very expensive, but if you are willing to pay it I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to ship it.</notes>
