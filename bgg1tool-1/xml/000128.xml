   <description>It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The 9-8-7,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Constant decisions to be made and drama from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;vise_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; of limited possibilities ever closing. Can be played by ANY number of people, as long as everyone has a board and a set of tiles. (This set contains four boards/sets of tiles.)
Condition: Fine (you can tell the game has been played a few times, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in great shape). The box has some sticky residue left from tape and a couple of small dings. One of the game pieces is missing; however, it has been replaced by an excellent proxy, allowing the game to be played without a problem.</notes>

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY 101141N)
Take It Easy is a staff favorite, and an excellent and accessible game for all levels of players. This is a new edition of the out-of-print favorite, a true multi-player solitaire game in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. The box comes with materials for six players, but there’s no limit to number of players if you’ve got enough sets on hand - which makes it an excellent choice for game nights, families and parties (Take It Easy has been played by over 250 gamers simultaneously at the renowned _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Gathering of Friends_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; annual gaming event!). One person (the caller, who may also play) randomly draws one of 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered pipes crossing in three directions. Each player then places a tile on his hexagonal board, with the goal of connecting the colored lines edge to edge. Placement continues until the hexes are filled, and scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. As accessible as bingo, but with color, strategy - and a lot more fun!</notes>
