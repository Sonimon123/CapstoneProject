In Isle of Trains, players are train operators, building trains with the right mix of freight cars needed to complete delivery contracts before your opponents. Cards are used in multiple ways: they can be built as train cars or buildings supporting your train line, used as currency to pay the cost of building those new train cars and buildings, or used as cargo to load on available train cars. When loading cargo on an opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s train, players receive an immediate benefit or action, but they are also giving their opponent the cargo they just might need to be able to complete a delivery contract and score big! Balancing the need to upgrade your train, take advantage of benefits from loading other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; trains, and complete delivery contracts first is the key to being the most successful train operator on the Isle of Trains!</notes>

    <notes>Dice Hate Me Games (DHMISLE)
In Isle of Trains, players are train operators, building trains with the right mix of freight cars needed to complete delivery contracts before your opponents. Cards are used in multiple ways: they can be built as train cars or buildings supporting your train line, used as currency to pay the cost of building those new train cars and buildings, or used as cargo to load on available train cars. When loading cargo on an opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s train, players receive an immediate benefit or action, but they are also giving their opponent the cargo they just might need to be able to complete a delivery contract and score big! Balancing the need to upgrade your train, take advantage of benefits from loading other players_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; trains, and complete delivery contracts first is the key to being the most successful train operator on the Isle of Trains!</notes>

    <notes>Brand new, in-shrink. Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags. I will work with you to ship the most cost efficient way or however you prefer. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. If the item is a small card game the shipping will be USPS First Class and will be under $5 total with shipping materials. Local pickup with no shipping available if you live in the Seattle area.

I will only sell this game if someone buys another one of my games and then I can ship this along too and you will get a little card game for a little price!  Played once by myself.</notes>
