    <notes>A 100% complete copy of the deluxe game.  It is unpunched and unplayed.  The components are in mint condition.  The box has creasing on the lid and the bottom from having far too many games stacked on top.  It is solid however with no split corners.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to post pictures upon request.
Buyer to pay postage not to exceed the USPS Priority Flat rate of $8.95. Insurance would be an additional $1.65. I am always happy to combine shipping for multiple purchases. International buyers need to contact me for rates. Most of western Europe is around $24.00 USD for 6-10 day service.

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition and has never been played.  The shrinkwrap has been removed but the pieces are unpunched.  There is normal shelfwear on the box.  
I am also including the Tyrant expansion which is unplayed and unpunched (This expansion retailed for $20 on its own).
I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. This game will ship USPS priority mail, flat rate box. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.
Shipping cost is $10.00

All games come a smoke free home, they have been carefully stored and protected.  My late husband was an avid board game and collector.  He took excellent care of his games, most games have never been played, and if they had been played no food or drink was allowed while playing the game.  Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask me any questions.
Thank you!</notes>
