   <description>Escape From Colditz is a 1-vs-many semi-cooperative game where one player is the Security Officer of the German forces, and the others are Escape Officers for various nationalities or prisoners of war (POWs).  Escape Officers try to acquire the equipment they need for a successful escape (rope, wire cutters, etc.), while the Security Officer tries to hinder them by putting them in solitary confinement and consficating their equipment._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Play lasts for a pre-determined length of time or number of rounds.  If an Escape Officer can free a pre-determined number of POWs (usually 2) before then, they win. Otherwise the Security Officer wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game was co-designed by Major PR Reid, a British soldier who was one of the few to actually successfully escape from Colditz during the Second World War._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Parker edition with wooden pawns. Complete with all parts and the interior red cross box in good condition. The board is slightly warped and the box looks like, well, kids played with it and then somebody dumped it in the attic. An edition for the player not the collector.
This is a heavy, large game with shipping to the US likely to double the price.</notes>

    <notes>Escape From Colditz: This edition (first edition, I believe) published by H.P. Gibson. The cardboard box, a long rectangle with art including swastikas, is in pretty rough shape -- all the panel art is basically intact, but almost every corner is torn, some crushed, all taped, and then some torn again. All the components, including the board of 4 interlocking pieces, cards, wooden pawns, dice, and rule book, are in very good condition and appear to be complete. 
Thanks for your order! 
$14.95 shipping in USA.
I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica, MA, USA.
International orders, please ask about shipping costs before ordering.
You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS loses or damages the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
If you can provide your email address, you may pay by credit card via Google Checkout.  Or you may pay by PayPal to karlhanf@comcast.net , or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thanks again!  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll await your payment or questions.

    <notes>Gibson Games 1980s edition, large box with swastika on front (and on cards). Wooden pawns. 
Game is in nice condition and all components are present and accounted for. Includes blurb/letter for a contest which ended in 1986. Box is in good condition with a little corner wear. There are pen marks on the inventory/overview sheets and some cracks on the plastic insert inside. I make these things sound worse than they really are, if you have any more questions feel free to GM me. I can take photographs for any interested parties.</notes>

    <notes>Escape From Colditz - 1973 Parker Brothers version (with swastika and the single fold board) in good used shape. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve inspected it thoroughly and counted all the parts to verify that it is complete with all original pieces.
I searched online and purchased the Appel (map of several different starting positions for the guards) because it was the only piece missing, and I really wanted to be able to describe the game as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;complete_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. All pawns are present and original as well. Cards are complete and even sleeved.
The box itself has expected wear due to its age and has one taped corner. To be honest, the game board does have some spotty discolouration on the backside, but it is not marked or stained on the playing surface at all.
No need to order this game from the UK as it is available right here in North America. No expensive import fees. If you were ever interested in owning this rare game, but didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to pay a fortune for it, this could be for you.</notes>

    <notes>Gibson Games edition (has the German Eagle rather than the Swastika on the box cover). Complete (one of the green pawns is a slightly lighter that the others so may be a replacement) and in good to very good condition.
- Box lid has one split corner (fixed)
- The 4 piece jig board has some slight warping but nothing that would stop the game being played. Putting under weights in the airing cupboard would fix it (we haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t got a propper airing cupboard)
- There is also some slight discolouration/fading on parts of the board. This may clean with the appropriate treatment. See image below.
Overall very good for a game that is 40 years old.
From a smoke and pet free home - will also pack carefully.</notes>

    <notes>This is a copy of Escape from Colditz that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had since I was a kid, looking to get rid of because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m moving.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in good condition, complete (except for the dice which are not original - funny how they always get borrowed then lost), and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s nothing obvious wrong with it except some wear and damage to the box from storage and a couple of slight marks on the playing board.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to avoid the hassle of ebay if I can, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m prepared to take £30 plus postage and costs.
Please note: this edition of the game has swastikas on the box and game board and therefore I cannot ship to any country where this is illegal or may cause offence.</notes>
