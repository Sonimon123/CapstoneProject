   <description>In Factory Funner, players are factory managers who select and install machines in their factory. They try connect all machine input and output pipes to the right reservoirs or to other machines in order to build the most profitable configuration. A new machine brings revenue. Other things you build (reservoirs and connectors (pipelines)) cost 1K money each._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In each game round, players may select one machine (from a number of machines equal to the number of players) simultaneously, which means players try to quickly determine possible connections, then grab the tile they want. But by choosing too quickly, you risk taking a machine that doesn't fit well... When fitting in a machine, a key tactic is to keep the most and best options for connecting future machines!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After eight rounds, the player with the most money wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The second edition of this game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; Factory Funner_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;Bigger _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; features the same gameplay as the original release, but with a deeper box, more connectors, and slightly different colors for better usability, and without the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;jump_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; machine as it had a high luck factor and created rules difficulty during play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Its_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; a Kickstarter version, that Includes some promo tiles. 
Played a few times, but in perfect condition. There is a crack on one side of the lid, but it can be easily glued I think. Pictures here - https://boardgamegeek.com/images/user/104450/hristo-filipov
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a surprisingly heavy game (more then 2 kilos), so the shipping would be expensive. To Europe - 25 euros. Eslewhere, please ask first!</notes>

    <notes>Factory Funner, Cwali First Edition.  This copy is brand new, still in shrink.  There are a few small dings on the box: One of the back corners is slightly smooshed and there is a slight indent with some scuffing and a crease near the bottom of the front lid.  I tried to take pictures of both but they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re tricky to show since they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re fairly minor.  I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worry about either unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re super particular about box condition.  Since the box is in shrink I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t comment on the components, but I assume they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all perfect.
Shipping within the US will be via USPS Medium Flat Rate at an additional $12.50.  Payment will be via Paypal.  Local pickup in Tucson is available.</notes>

    <notes>Selling one copy of the 2016 Factory Funner (Crowd Funner Edition).
The game is no longer in shrinkwrap, but it is unplayed.
All components in the game (tiles and counters, wooden pieces, board, scorepad and rules) are all present.
The game box is in very good shape.  If you look at the box top at an angle, you see some scuff marks that occurred during the original transit.
The game comes from a non-smoking household.
I also have one copy of the Factory Funner Expansion 1 for sale.  It can be added to the sale as an additional item.  Please GeekMail me for specifics.</notes>
