Here they explore a shifting landscape of ancient archetypes, modern terrors, and mismatched elements of the waking world. This is the shared unconsciousness of humanity, the boundless well of hopes and fears that makes us human. The reality they create in this timeless realm reverberates through the minds of dreamers everywhere. Some dream lords seek to protect it, others to dominate it, and others to destroy it._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Dreamblade collectible miniatures game allows you to project your mind into the dreamscape and wage war against an endless sea of rivals.

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m looking to get rid of all my surpluse Dreamblade game materials.  This set would work best for someone looking to expand on a very modest collection (say one starter box).  This lot would not work for someone starting without the board and rules (although I might be able to get a map and rules if someone does want this game material so as to try and get started in the game.
This lot includes close to 200 figures, primarily commons, from the first two sets:
2 unopened Dreamblade base set boosters
1 near complete set of base set commons (N=31)
Another near complete set of base set commons (N=30)
3 complete sets of Baxar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commons, (20 commons make a complete set, so 60 total minis here)
2 partially complete sets of Baxar_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s common (N=16; N=14)
About 6 or so random Baxar commons and 20 random base set commons.
Shipping is $11 to Eastern and Central time zone and $13 to Pacific and Mountain.  Shipping is a bit high as this is a bulky lot (one of the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s downfalls I suspect)</notes>

    <notes>I have a massive collection of these figures I received in a trade. I dont know a whole lot about them as I have not had a chance to sift through them other than to sort by faction.
From the info I received in the trade there is the contents of a booster box of many of the sets. I can provide some pics to provide sense of how many minis are there and what might be included. I can check for specifics but cant get a real detailed list. I would move this as a lot and am open to offers.
This would be quite heavy as well so shipping but again I would work something out that is fair to both of us!
Send me a message if interested!</notes>

    <notes>Good sized collection of Dreamblade figures.  A friend of mine and I went together and bought the remaining stock from a store after the game was discontinued; this is half of that set.  It will serve as a good starting point for new players and may serve well to enhance an existing collection also.
Picture depicts miniatures to be included in this sale.  Also, includes two game-maps, dice and a rulebook.
Domestic shipping is $15 via FedEx Ground.  Please contact me for an international shipping quote.  Thanks for looking and be sure to check out my other games for sale.
NOTE:  I will take reasonable precautions in securely packing these miniatures for shipment, however I will not be responsible for any broken miniatures upon delivery.</notes>

SHIPPING:
   USA: $8.75 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.

    <notes>Brand new figures, still in their little bags.  Just figures, not boxes or rules.  From smoke-free home.  Most of the figures are commons.
$25 for a set of 53 unique figures, or $22 for a set of 51 unique figures, or $19 for 48 unique, or $15 for 39 unique, or $12 for 34 unique (1 of them unbagged), or $9 for 28 unique (1 of them unbagged).
Or $60 for all 253 miniatures!  (6 copies each of 28 characters, 5 copies each of 34-28=6 characters, 4 copies each of 39-34=5 characters, 3 copies each of 48-39=9 characters, 2 copies each of 51-48=3 characters, and 1 copy each of 53-51=2 characters.) 
Shipping $7 regardless of size of lot(s).
SHIPPING:
   USA: $7 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com (credit cards accepted) to karlhanf@comcast.net ; or by Google Checkout if you give me your email; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.  
Thank you!  I await your payment or questions.
