   <description>Rook is a trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers.  The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.))._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card).  Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.  The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits from a standard deck of cards, has often been a card game played by religious groups who object to using a standard deck of cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I actually have two copies.  The one listed herein is the same as that pictured on BGG.  The box has some minor creases in it, but the cards are in excellent condition.  The other deck I have is listed as copyright 1963 and is held in a hard plastic container.  The inner cardboard box is red in color with white and black color.  The cards in this one are also in excellent shape.  If you are interested in that one, the price is the same. If you want the older game, let me know either when you order, or in a separate e-mail.  
Shipping is the shipping cost, plus $2 for anywhere in the continental U.S., and shipping cost plus $4 for elsewhere.  
Also, I have lowered the prices of all my games.  They will be at this price until the end of August.  I look forward to doing business with you!</notes>

    <notes>Rook (1959) from Parker Brothers
Box: Very light shelf-wear on the bottom with a couple of spots where the design is smeared from tape having been removed. The plastic cover is in solid, excellent shape but it is very dirty (not with dirt, but stained from years of exposure). The insert is like new!
Contents: This is a near mint set which looks like it just came out of the shrink-wrap! The rule book is bright white, the yellow Rules for a Club Game booklet is pristine and the cards are amazing! I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this was ever played, and if it was, it was only sparingly and no wear at all has occurred. This is a very collectible copy of a classic game!

But beware the wild Rook; when he lands, everything can change. And it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not necessarily for the better... </notes>

Reserved for MFatman for pickup at Gen Con
Please submit payment via PayPal, Google Wallet or Venmo to gramaw@gmail.com.  Alternatively, you may pay, via one of these methods or COD, directly at the convention.  
Since I am selling so many games I plan to meet as many buyers as possible on Saturday morning at 9AM outside of hall A on level 1 of the convention center, near room 128 (this was the former location of multiple Gen Con Math trade meetups, in case you are familiar.)  You can find a link to a map of the denoted area here:    https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4236187/gramaw
If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>
