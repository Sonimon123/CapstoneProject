   <description>The Agents is a strategic card game that introduces a unique double-edged card mechanism into the undercover world of covert operations, subterfuge, secrecy and sabotage. Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each Agent card features a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;command_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; on one end of the card and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;points_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; on the other end. The direction in which you place the card determines from which asset you benefit. If you choose to perform the command, one of your opponents scores the points; if you keep the points for yourself, an opponent gets to perform the command. With 25 different Agents, each with its own unique ability, Agents can be turned, killed, extracted and swapped _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; making the game ever flexible, variable, unpredictable and a test of forward planning and quick thinking. As you learn about each Agent's special abilities, discover how Agents work together or against each other, and weigh up the advantages of collecting points for yourself versus using the commands to further your goals and sabotage your opponent's strategies, the game becomes increasingly complex, dynamic and challenging._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Missions, played alongside Factions of Agents, provide interesting, strategic conditions which, if fulfilled, score you big points _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but if you race ahead, you'll also become a target for attack. The better you're doing, the more under fire you'll be._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the full kickstarter Agents game. This lot included the base game, rules, all promos, the fancy box, and all of the expansions, including spoofs. The game has been played once using the base set, the rest have only been looked at. See the pictures below. 
The fancy box has a small crease on one end, as you can see in the picture. This happened to most of the fancy boxes as they were not packaged well, but this one survived pretty well given how some were received. 
Email if you have any other questions. </notes>

    <notes>Also includes the Kickstarter LE Expansion Black Ops.
New and unplayed - Note these were shipped by the author/maker without shrink wrap and in an envelope so has some minor wear on the box.
US Shipping is $5-7 depending on your distance from the west coast.
I also have the fancy box version with the game and all 6 expansions, it will be $80 (before shipping which will be more due to the size).

    <notes>1. THE AGENTS card game - decks including Agents, Points, and Missions. Rule book included. Includes all Kickstarter bonuses that will NOT be in the eventual retail release - including the Commanders Promo Pack.
2. Black Ops Expansion - please note that the card sleeve for this expansion was a litte smushed during shipping. Saar has noted in the Kickstarter that he never meant these sleeves to be permanent containers so they were not designed with strength in mind. The cards themselves are untouched and will play perfectly. 
NB - Shipping will be exact cost via your preferred method.
NB2 - I am new to selling on BGG but not to selling online. My eBay account has 3700+ feedback - please feel free to PM for the name and then contact me through it to verify that we are indeed the same. </notes>

    <notes>Near mint condition, only played twice.
Only played twice and the cards are plastic so don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really damage anyway. Has all the Kickstarter stuff.
Includes these expansions...
The Agents: Black Ops
The Agents: Mission: Critical
The Agents: The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Secret_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Agents
The Agents: The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Special_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Agents
The Agents: The Partners
Will be packaged with care due to the original packaging for the expansion cards being less than fantastic.
Shipped via MyHermes (£3)
I will combine shipping for all my other Marketplace items.
If outside the UK, please contact me for postage costs first.

Sweeteners:
Mission Critical
Black Ops
Both of the sweeteners are also unplayed - they come in separate cardboard sleeves which are pretty banged up. This was an unfortunately common occurrence during the shipping process. Creator has stated that he never meant for the cardboard sleeves to be permanent storage. The cards themselves are, of course, perfect.</notes>

Pictures show exactly what you will get, other than the rule book pictured is the wrong one.  The rule book you will get is cut funny so that the last word on the outside edge of the bottom half of each page is cut off.  You can still figure out what they are saying- just a little nuisance.
Full digital Rule book is available at this link: http://thoughtprocess.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rulebook-print-web.pdf
