Both sets are opened but like new. The original set was played once, the expansion opened and the cards were looked at.
Shipping within the US would be $12 via priority mail for both.</notes>

Update: Several geeks asked about shipping cost to US, it is expensive: the cheapest one is roughly 20 GBP and it will take 56+ days with tracking only in UK and a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;signed for_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; service when it reaches the destination.</notes>

    <notes>The only damage is to on corner of the box where the corner has ripped and been repaired with tape. Otherwise all the pieces are there and look in good condition (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve counted all the cards, figures, etc. to double check).
Note: This will cost about £11.50 to send surface mail to the USA, (I know this as I sent one recently !) and around double that airmail.
Thanks.</notes>

    <notes>Base game and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Winter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; expansion - both in the same box, i.e. the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Winter_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; box was binned. Would prefer to sell as a job lot but will consider offers to break them up. 
Quite heavy, so probably UK only.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also selling the Forbidden forest expansion. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s currently in the same box so if you wanted both that would be ideal !
Happy to sell both for £30, 
Forbidden Forest I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll sell seperately at £25 as there is no box.
Postage will be £7 if you buy both or jsut the main game as the box is a heavy one. postage abroad... even more !
...or can collect from Twickenham area.
thanks,
James

    <notes>**** ON HOLD DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE ghettojeppetto ****
Very nice copy of this out of print classic which looks like new and unplayed and is mostly still unpunched (some things fell out of sprues and were bagged). Everything is bagged still incl minis, cards etc though I am unsure if bags are original (hard to tell I am not original owner) so its possible the game was played once and some things rebagged. 
Verified 100% complete and all components are in excellent unplayed condition, the only flaw I noticed was very light mottling on one board due to how things are stored inside the box by design. Also note that four of the 100 blood tokens are proxy replacements (very close to original)
Box is in good shape for its age and very solid with light wear, some mottling and a crease on the back. 
Can send pictures if wanted.
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice. </notes>

    <notes>The game is in absolutely excellent condition. The box shows normal shelfwear on the corners and edges, but it is hardly noticeable. 
Unfortunately, it is only 99.8% complete. There are only 11 of the 12 cardboard pieces which fit together to form columns; there are only 97 out of the 104 Damage tokens (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included a photo). These are *extremely* minor faults which I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t believe affect gameplay. Everything else is present and in beautiful condition.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, very lightly played (if at all), complete, mostly punched. Cards are mint fresh. Most tokens have been punched out but appear never to have been assembled.  52 damage counters remain unpunched. The gameboards are in excellent shape, as are the miniatures and both sets of instructions. Box has been opened carefully and has some, but very little shelf wear.  Very slight dishing/creasing on the box top.  Corners fully intact.
Shipping: I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this will fit flat rate, so if you are far away, fully insured USPS or UPS will be at most $19.  Nearby it will be more like $10. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m at zip code 46516 (Indiana).
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders. Bitcoin works too.</notes>

    <notes>This is a very good example of this long out of print game.
Although not rare, it is very difficult to find a copy in such good condition.
100% complete including all tokens and in a very good condition. The box looks great with virtually no shelf wear. Heroes have been painted to a very good standard, please see link below for pictures. Alternatively the game can be supplied with unpainted Heroes if preferred. All other miniatures are unpainted.
I have owned the game from new and it has been kept carefully as part of my game collection since purchase. Game comes from a smoke and pet free home.
Thanks for your interest!</notes>

    <notes>Language dependence, the game is friendly priced, but beware of the in game Dutch language. Conversion needed to be playable.   
Condition: the components are still in stanches, but the condition is set at very good as the box itself has some damage on two corners. Besides this the game looks new and is unplayed. Ask for photos if wanted. 
Please send a message if you are interested and ask for shipping costs to your location. Payment can be done by bank transfer or Pay pal. If you have any other question, please feel free to ask.</notes>
