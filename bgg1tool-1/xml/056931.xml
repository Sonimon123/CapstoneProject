   <description>The revolt in Rome will not end for a long time to come! Join the action and find out who is the most powerful ruler by skillfully playing your cards. No matter if you strengthen your own position with strong cards like Arena or Ballista or if you augment your victory points with Templarius and Triremis - you will be the winner if you use your characters and buildings with wit and savvy. You may also combine Roma II - Arena with Roma and discover even more options._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Arena is a complete game of its own, but it may very well be combined with the cards from Roma.

Arena is a complete game of its own, but it may very well be combined with the cards from Roma. These are the play options:
- Mix all the cards of both games and play with the combined set.
- Both players take one set of cards. Players will have their own draw and discard piles.
- Both players can use the cards of both games, compiling their own decks of 55 cards each. Again, both players will have their own draw and discard piles.

    <notes>Includes both Roma _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Arena: Roma II.
Both of the games are in like new condition overall. The boxes have very minimal shelf wear on the corners, but the components are punched and in unplayed/like new condition.
If you only want one or the other title, GM me and we can talk.
I can ship them in a single box if you prefer (Both games fit quite well in either the Roma I or Roma II box, take your pick), or I can ship both boxes in a single parcel though it might be a bit more expensive to ship both boxes.
I make sure to ship games so that they arrive at your door in the same condition that they left my house in. The interior of game boxes will be packed to make sure contents do not shift during transit.
I will ship only to residences within the United States. Parcel tracking is mandatory for your and my protection. Insurance is strongly recommended. Buyer pays all shipping costs.
I only charge exact shipping amounts. I generally quote a bit higher on shipping estimates to make sure all costs are covered but any amount that goes over actual shipping costs I will refund. Games are expensive enough as it is without shipping costs biting into them.
GM me with any questions you might have or to request a shipping estimate to your zipcode. </notes>

No matter if you strengthen your own position with strong cards like Arena or Ballista or if you augment your victory points with Templarius and Triremis - you will be the winner if you use your characters and buildings with wits. You may also combine _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Roma II - Arena_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Roma_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and discover even more options. </notes>

Both English rulebooks are signed by Stefan Feld![/b] (to “Gergo”)
The game comes from a private collection (non-smoking and pet-free environment).
It has been opened and played once. All components are in excellent condition. Both games come in the Roma box.
The box lid is still in its original shrink wrap for extra protection. It can be easily removed in case you find it unnecessary. I’m simply very picky about game condition and like to give my games this extra protection :)

Reserved for CarcassonneFreak for pickup at Gen Con
Please submit payment via PayPal, Google Wallet or Venmo to gramaw@gmail.com.  Alternatively, you may pay, via one of these methods or COD, directly at the convention.  
Since I am selling so many games I plan to meet as many buyers as possible on Saturday morning at 9AM outside of hall A on level 1 of the convention center, near room 128 (this was the former location of multiple Gen Con Math trade meetups, in case you are familiar.)  You can find a link to a map of the denoted area here:    https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4236187/gramaw
If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>

    <notes>Never played. Game is essentially in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition but for some reason, the interior card board game divider has some mild _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;tears_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; at the bottom of one side. Otherwise, box is in excellent condition.</notes>
