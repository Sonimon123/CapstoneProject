   <description>Codex: Card-Time Strategy is a customizable, non-collectible card game set in the Fantasy Strike universe that's inspired by real-time strategy video games such as Starcraft and Warcraft 3. Players each control three different heroes and have access to a tech tree that allows them to use different strategies each time they play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's base. To do this, players build up an army of units and heroes. Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Codex is an RTS-themed customizable card game. You build your deck as you play from a pool of cards in your _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;codex_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll grow your economy by hiring workers, and spend the gold on summoning heroes, leveling them up, casting their spells, and building more and more powerful units. 
This Deluxe set is packed with YEARS of gameplay. First, you get all six main factions plus the neutral faction. This includes all the cards from the starter, core, and expansion products. You also get fancy playmats, exclusive map cards that change a rule about the game each playthrough, and snazzy binders for each of the six main factions. A custom-made box is designed to hold all this stuff, even if you sleeve your cards.

    <notes>This listing is for the Codex Deluxe Edition.  It includes every card in the starter set + every card in the core set + multiple expansions, and more. It all comes in a huge box that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s designed to hold everything in style.
The Deluxe Set contains:
2 neutral hero decks from the Starter Set
3 red hero decks from the Core Set
3 green hero decks from the Core Set
3 blue hero decks from the Flagstone Dominion expansion
3 black hero decks from the Blackhand Scourge expansion
3 white hero decks from the Whitestar Order expansion
3 purple hero decks from the Vortoss Conclave expansion
8 starting decks: 2 neutral, 1 red, 1 green, 1 blue, 1 black, 1 white, 1 purple
6 Codex binders, each with graphic design of a different faction
2 huge game boards (24_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x14_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; each, a stretch goal will upgrade them to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;mousepad material_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; playmats)
12 exclusive map cards that change gameplay each game
5 Mercenary token cards to help with playing free-for-all
27 red and green token cards (Squirrel, Pirate, etc.)
19 blue and black token cards
17 white and purple token cards
Dozens of tracking chits for damage, gold, XP, etc
20 mini-cards (one for each spec) + 10 mini-cards for add-ons (enough for 5-player free-for-all)
Rulebook
Sweet box designed to hold it all
That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s over 700 cards!
The Codex Deluxe box *is* designed to fit all the cards, even if you put card sleeves on them. The Codex binders are also designed to hold sleeved cards.
The box is also designed to hold all the tons of stuff you get. The neutral faction + 6 colors of factions will fit inside. Keep in mind that you can build a team out of any 3 heroes, even if they are from different factions. Codex with neutral + 6 colors has 20 total heroes, meaning you can build more than 1000+ possible _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;decks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Furthermore, because each hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s set of cards is a coherent chunk that can stand on its own, all 1000+ of those possible decks should be fun to play and stand at least a reasonable chance of winning.
Map Cards. We found that that _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;casino cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; were one of the best things in Pandante 2nd Edition. They each change the rules of the game in some way, so that each time you play there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s some new twist. In Codex, this takes the form of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;map cards,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which only come in the deluxe version.
Shipping weight is approximately 10 pounds.

The box is also designed to hold all the tons of stuff you get. The neutral faction + 6 colors of factions will fit inside. Keep in mind that you can build a team out of any 3 heroes, even if they are from different factions. Codex with neutral + 6 colors has 20 total heroes, meaning you can build more than 1000+ possible _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;decks._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Furthermore, because each hero_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s set of cards is a coherent chunk that can stand on its own, all 1000+ of those possible decks should be fun to play and stand at least a reasonable chance of winning.

    <notes>Codex Deluxe Edition.
This item is in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition and has not been played.  One card deck has been opened, rest of the cards are still sealed.
This item is large and heavy, so shipping will be expensive.  Local pickup within the Toronto area preferred.

    <notes>This is the 280 $ Reward Tier from the Codex Kickstarter back in early 2016 : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sirlin/codex-2
That means it includes the Full Deluxe box, all stretch goals included and also 800 Sleeves. Some extra sleeves are available.
The insert had to be removed so everything can actually fit properly in the box when the cards are sleeved and inserted in the binders.
I am selling it because of the lack of players willing to play it in my area.
The shipping costs will be calculated based on your location for delivery.
Additional pictures of the box and all the components inside are available if requested.</notes>
