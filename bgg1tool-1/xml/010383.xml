   <description>In Risk Godstorm the players are priests looking to lead their race (Greek, Celtic, Babylonian, Norse, and Egyptian) to dominate the ancient world and the Underworld as well. To do this they will need to marshall their forces, dominate continents, acquire relics of power and call their Gods to earth._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Risk Godstorm uses the basic combat elements of classic Risk but alters many other elements. The game is played on an ancient map of the world that focuses on Europe and Northern Africa. Atlantis is also present and highly desirable however a chaotic event can see the fabled city sink into oblivion, taking all the forces present there with it._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At its core the players are trying to control territories and controlling entire continents earns the players bonus units to deploy and further their cause._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One of the key differences to classic Risk is that the Underworld can be invaded and defeated units can also be sent to the Underworld to fight again, with some proving themselves worthy enough to return to the Earth._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As in the play of Risk 2210 A.D., Risk Godstorm is played over 5 rounds (called Epochs here). At the end of that time frame the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner. Victory Points are earned for the number of territories controlled + region bonuses + control of crypts and altars in the Underworld and for every relic that offers a territory bonus if that territory is controlled._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Also like Risk 2210 A.D., the game begins with a number of territories out of play. Here they are called Plague Lands._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Risk Godstorm also allows players to play Classic Risk using the Risk Godstorm board for an alternate experience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Complete with all components.  Only played once, and the box and everything else is in excellent condition.
Insured shipping to anywhere in the U.S. is $12.00 (sorry for the high amount, but the game weighs nearly five pounds).  I prefer payment by PayPal, but will also accept money orders.  I do NOT accept personal checks.
I have not sold many items on BGG, but my eBay rating is over 130 with 100% positive feedback.</notes>

    <notes>All game components present: All plastic units, boards, cards, tokens, manuals in excellent condition.
The only thing that is not present is the brown, cardboard structure designed to hold the units neatly inside the box when packing away. This component was flimsy and not good quality so I discarded it. Units are instead sealed in zip-lock freezer bags. 
The box is unfortunately slightly bumped in one corner. This is how it arrived when I first bought it (mail-ordered). It has received no damage while in my care.</notes>

    <notes>The game is like new. The box has been opened but all the playing components inside are still sealed in factory bags. 
Shipping is the lesser of the following. USPS Priority Mail calculated based on destination, package dimensions and weight. Use my Zip Code, 95829, and yours. 
Box is 13 x 13 x 5. Weight is 5 lbs 13 oz. If shipping is more than $13.65, I will ship USPS Medium Flat Rate box for that price.</notes>
