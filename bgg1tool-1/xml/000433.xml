   <description>Shark is a stock-trading game slightly reminiscent of Acquire, in that abstract plays on the game board determine the share values of the various companies.  The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player may buy (maximum 5 shares total during the turn) and sell (unlimited) shares both before and after his turn, and during his turn rolls dice to determine which company he can affect and in what region he can place that company's marker.    Placing next to another of that company's markers increases the company's share price, which pays out in two ways: first, for placing the marker, the player gets money equal to the new price, and secondly, all players get paid the amount of the increase, multiplied by the number of shares each of them owns.    This wealth is not without risks, though, as placing  in a way that brings two companies' marker-groups adjacent to each other causes the smaller group to be removed from the board, decreasing that company's share price accordingly -- and all players  must pay the amount of the decrease, again multiplied by the number of shares they hold in that company!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game ends if all of one company's markers have been used, if one company's share price reaches 15, or all of shares in the game are sold; at which time the players cash out their stock and determine who, with the most money, has won._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

 The game came missing 2 pawns of each color, I substituted a different type of pawn to make the count 20 of each color. Just wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be Flying Turtle without some production mess up. 
 All stock here and in excellent condition. Both dice present and in good condition. Game board excellent. Money all there and in good condition.
 Rule book present and in very good condition.
 I added 4 nice wooden pawns for stock counters They are seen in the picture as are the substitute pawns.

Hard to categorize the condition of this game.  
Components are brand new.  Cards, dice, and buildings are all still in shrinkwrap.  
Box is structurally solid.  Light-to moderate whitening on corners.  Main defect is that top cover is slightly scratched/whitened.  I would say graphics on top cover are still 85% good.  If interested, geekmail me and I will provide photos.
Buyer pays actual USPS shipping from zip code 37115.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and I also have printed out the English translated rules. The box shows wear but there are not split corners and the lid is not caved in. The board lays flat and is not warped in any way.
Shipping will be covered by the purchaser and I charged exact price. Once sale is final, I will package the game and determine shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Shark is a stock-trading game slightly reminiscent of Acquire, in that abstract plays on the game board determine the share values of the various companies. The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.
Each player may buy (maximum 5 shares total during the turn) and sell (unlimited) shares both before and after his turn, and during his turn rolls dice to determine which company he can affect and in what region he can place that company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s marker. Placing next to another of that company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s markers increases the company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s share price, which pays out in two ways: first, for placing the marker, the player gets money equal to the new price, and secondly, all players get paid the amount of the increase, multiplied by the number of shares each of them owns. This wealth is not without risks, though, as placing in a way that brings two companies_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; marker-groups adjacent to each other causes the smaller group to be removed from the board, decreasing that company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s share price accordingly -- and all players must pay the amount of the decrease, again multiplied by the number of shares they hold in that company!
The game ends if all of one company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s markers have been used, if one company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s share price reaches 15, or all of shares in the game are sold; at which time the players cash out their stock and determine who, with the most money, has won.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent! Box corners have a little whitening, but no rips or tears. Inventoried the components. Rulebook said to have 20 each of player pieces. There are 18 of each of the 4 colors. Since every color is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;missing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; exactly 2, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more a misprint. Reading through the rules, one of the ways the game ends is by running out of pieces, so everyone is on an even playing field.
Edition is the 1987 Flying Turtle Games one.</notes>

    <notes>My late husband loved to collect his board games.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play them as much as he would of liked, but if they were played, they were handled with kid gloves.  No food or drinking around his games!  
Game has never been played, shrink wrap has been removed off box, however cards inside are still in shrink wrap</notes>
