   <description>Theme:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world.  Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc.  The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command.  Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Goal:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions.  They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other.  Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command.  Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided.  Characters have basic statistics to start.  These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence].  Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two.  Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells.  This all makes the players actually feel different during play.  In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices.  On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.  Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world.  Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space.  Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.  These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics.  Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.  If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so.  The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.  If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice.  If the attacker loses, he loses a life._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world.  There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price.  Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple.  However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman.  The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World.  There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command.  Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life.  It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Revised using:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Talisman: Upgrade Pack_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Talisman_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s 4th editio0n by FFG and *all* expansions released through the end of 2012, as listed below:
Talisman (fourth edition) base set
Talisman (fourth edition): The Blood Moon Expansion 
Talisman (fourth edition): The Dragon Expansion 
Talisman (fourth edition): The Dungeon Expansion 
Talisman (fourth edition): The Frostmarch Expansion 
Talisman (fourth edition): The Highland Expansion 
Talisman (fourth edition): The Reaper Expansion 
Talisman (fourth edition): The Sacred Pool Expansion 
All boxes are included, but the components have been combined (as in, the adventure deck includes the cards for all of the expansions).
Only played twice, and in very good condition.
Shipping (there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a *lot* here): $19 standard (priority mail would be spendy, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have to weigh it and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d depend on where you live)
Orders of multiple games can be combined to have cheaper shipping that if they were separate.

    <notes>RESERVED for Noark20037, winner in the Charity Auction for Global Health.
Black Industries Edition (2007)
The contents have been upgraded with the Talisman Upgrade Pack. If you take my advice, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just have me throw out all the old components. But I still have them, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship you the tacky standups and older cards if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.
Contents: A-
Played a three or four times. I was the first person to use the upgrade pack (all the cards and figures). 
Box: B+
Slightly dished, and some noticeable shelf wear.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling my complete Talisman collection (All English versions) which includes: Talisman Revised 4th Edition with 6 expansions (The Reaper, The Dungeon, The Frostmarch, The Highland, The Sacred Pool and the Dragon) all of them are complete, including boxes and manuals in near mint condition.
 
I have also purchased 400 sleeves adventure cards, as well as big sleeves for the quest and character cards.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including premium marble tokens(jade, ruby and sapphire colors) to replace the ugly plastic cones. 
Nothing is missing from the game, not a single card, dice or manual and I have only played the game with my friends a couple times in the past year, then I had to move to France where I wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t able to find gaming buddies so I decided to sell the game and save some space in my tiny apartment.
 
I can put the items on eBay(got a 100% score with 76 transactions) but I would prefer to sell it directly to someone from these boards.
Let me know if you need more photos or information about it, cheers!</notes>

    <notes>Talisman 4th edition. I would prefer to sell this game with the following expansions:
Blood Moon
Sacred Pool
City
Dungeon
Highland
Dragon
Frostmarch 
Reaper
Every expansion for Talisman released to date! The expansions are all consolidated in the original and Highland boxes. I threw away the small boxes, dragon, dungeon and city boxes to save on storage space.
Total cost of all items in the collection is £75.
Postage is £8 by Royal Mail, less by Collect Plus. International shipping available - contact me for prices.
Geek mail me to combine multiple orders. Discounts are available.
Happy to meet in London to save on shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>ALSO includes full expansion, The Reaper.
Game is in great shape, the only cosmetic issue is a frog has fallen off it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s base, but could easily be glued on.
Other than that, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in great condition.  Would come with original box with The Reaper expansion mixed in.</notes>

    <notes>Game played once.  Everything included and in pristine condition.  Could probably be considered like new.  Also includes the Reaper, Dungeon, and Firelands expansions.  The Reaper was played with once, the other two were mixed in but are unplayed.  I have all the boxes and can separate out all components if needed.  You can also save on shipping if you just want me to ship everything in just the base box.  Just let me know.  Willing to entertain best offers.</notes>

    <notes>BLACK Ind edition. Used, damaged box.
The box has a split seam on one corner. The bottom has a cupping, wavy thing going on. The top is fine, slight wear on the corners. Rules are in a used condition. Half of the standees are still unpunched, cards seem unplayed. One of the black cards has a dent in it, that u may be able to see. They are the evil/good markes, so not a game play issue.

    <notes>This lot includes the following base game and expansions:
Talisman Revised 4th Edition (FFG)
The Dungeon
The Highland
The Dragon
The Reaper
The Frostmarch
The Sacred Pool
The game has only been played a few times and looks as good as new. All boxes (4 big boxes and 3 small boxes) are included and in great shape. All card decks are mixed together in preparation for a game using everything! 
This lot would cost $175 from a OLGS... my price is another 29% off of that, and includes US shipping! (Ignore the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;+ shipping_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; listed in the price... I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know how to tell the Marketplace free shipping.)
International: GM me before purchasing to be sure I can ship to your country and for a shipping quote (that includes a credit equivalent to US shipping).
All of my games are cared for in an OCD fashion in a smoke-free, pet free home!</notes>

Shipping:
I am happy to combine shipping on multiple items.
I can ship from both US and (if you are patient) Canada.
I will find the cheapest shipping method. Within the continental USA, this is typically Fedex. International shipping can be very expensive. 
Insurance and tracking:
I recommend paying for both of these. As a hobbyist and an individual seller, I cannot take responsibility for items that are damaged or lost in transit.</notes>

Original base game insert was thrown out. Original expansion boxes and inserts are still present and are packed in the base set box (see image). This should reduce shipping. All other components from the base game and both expansion are present and in great condition.  All expansion components are sorted and bagged in the appropriate expansion box. The game is in really great condition; I marked as Very Good only because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been played several times and I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t in good faith mark it Like New as such. The only wear and tear should be the barest bit of shelf wear on the main box. The cards were never sleeved.

    <notes>*GERMAN-LANGUAGE* Talisman Revised 4th Edition plus ALL German-language expansions. This includes the following, all in German:
- Talisman 4th Edition Revised (dt. Talisman: Die Magische Suche)
Large-box Expansions:
- Dungeon (Die Katakomben)
- Dragons (Die Drachen)
- Highlands (Das Hochland)
- The City (Die Stadt)
- Woodlands (Das Waldland)
- Cataclysm (Der Kataklysmus)
Small-box Expansions:
- Frostmarch (Die Frostmark)
- The Reaper (Der Schnitter)
- Sacred Pool (Die Heilige Quelle)
- Blood Moon (Der Blutmond)
- Harbinger (Der Vorbote)
- Firelands (Die Feuerlande)
Print-on-demand (POD) Expansions:
- Nether Realm (not shown in the photo because that expansion has no box)
(Note that the Deep Realms expansion was never published in German!)
Again: these are all *GERMAN-LANGUAGE* editions, so please only order them if you have a reasonably good command of the German language!
Notes:
- If you pick up the game yourself (dt. Selbstabholer) i will reduce the cost by 30 Euros.
- Ships from southern Germany. Weight is approx. 13kg, so shipping fees will not necessarily be small.
- All (1400+) cards from the base game and all expansions are sleeved, including the character and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ending_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cards.
- All tokens are unpunched.
- The core box was only used two or three times and the expansions were never used, so all components are like new EXCEPT for a few of the box inlays, which were cut apart to make better-fitting inlays.
- Reason for selling: i have a complete English-language set and never get a chance to use my German one.
- Photo album: https://goo.gl/photos/zp1vavgh9iiyezDMA (most of it shows the English edition, but there are also some photos of the German sets)
- Feel free to contact me (in German or English) with questions.</notes>

    <notes>Talisman bundle (base game is I believe the 2017 version - there is a date of OCT13 on the back; so, not sure, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think it is the 2008 edition)
This bundle Includes the base game as well as the following eleven expansions (many of these are now out of print):  Highland, Dungeon, Reaper, Frostmarch, Sacred Pool, The City, Blood Moon, Harbinger, Firelands, Woodland and Cataclysm.  All of the components are combined into the base game, Dungeon, Cataclysm and Reaper boxes.  Game components are all punched, bagged in unplayed, like new condition from a smoke free home.  This is described as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; only because of the limited boxes.  Base game includes its plastic insert, Cataclysm box has its insert but the other boxes included are without inserts.  Buyer pays pay pal fee and shipping costs (likely FedEx or UPS Ground).</notes>

    <notes>The game has been played a few times but has been collecting dust for longer. The box has a couple marks on it with some warn corners from moves. The pieces are all there and in good condition, but the board has one issue. My friend, bless them, accidentally broke it in two spots. Two of the fold lines were really weak and fell apart. The board is in three pieces, but honestly, it is not that bad because you just push them all together. The board was poorly designed and I bet this happens often. Pics included.  Buyer will pay to ship (~15$).</notes>
