   <description>This chess-like game was inspired by Shogi and themed around an anime style. Players set up the two different starter armies consisting of seven holy warriors, seven power-harvesting pawns and two power-harvesting uber-pawns. Fourteen warriors came with the starters, fifteen from the first expansion, and fifteen from the final expansion. Instead of the initial fourteen warriors, players may chose to draft seven (per side) of these 44 warriors which are summoned onto the board one-at-a-time during play. They can be promoted to more powerful chess/shogi style movement using power crystals. Many of these warriors have special magic powers (e.g., teleportation, resurrection, obliteration) which can be turned on by spending crystals._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One of the most exciting things about this chess/shogi variant is that there are multiple ways to win: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Creating a mating solution that forces surrender - Capturing the Navia (She's like the chess/shogi king)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Getting one's own Navia across and off the other side of the board _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;bull; Economic victory by attaining enough power-crystals for your Navia to blast your opponent off the board._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 5 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>One red and one blue starter set.  The blue set is missing the rule book, but otherwise, both are untouched--the pieces are still held in place by their twist ties.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw in two booster packs.  One is untouched, the other was painted by my son when he was first learning to paint--you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll probably want to strip them or repaint them.  </notes>

    <notes>The box is open but nothing has been unwrapped or played. All figures still sealed in slots with wire/twine or something.
Contains 2 hand-painted Naria mini battle pieces, 14 Maseitai battle figs, 18 Gulled battle pieces (14 black/4 red), 34 Gyullas crystals (still sealed in bag), 1 game board, 16 color attribute cards, 1 rule book.
That is a complete set of everything the demo box comes with.
Box is not good looking, plain white. You can see what type it is in on the game page of BGG. It was meant as a demo so while the game is complete, they had not done any art of the game box yet. Still, the painted figs in this are very nice! They spent some time on those.
I took a few pics of pieces, board, etc. I will send on request.</notes>
