   <description>This game illustrates Herr Rosenberg's talent for unique card games.  The deck is one through nine in six suits, with two of each card (two 1s, two 2s, etc.).  After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value he's collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Valley Games, Inc. (VLY 604)
Finally, the reprint of Schnappchen Jagd is here! Valley Games is excited to have this title now printing.This a very anticipated reprint of the popular German game by Uwe Rosenberg (Agricola, Le Havre, At the Gates of Loyang).
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;One man’s trash is another man’s treasure!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
Even better, everyone loves getting a bargain on this junk. But a true bargain is when you get more than your money’s worth. More often than not, though, items we think will be valuable simply are trash. You must decide which items will keep their value and not become worthless. But remember, the more popular a bargain, the much harder it is to find.
BARGAIN HUNTER is a trick-taking game where TRUMP COLOR (if any) is determined during each TRICK. Players try to collect ITEMS and get the best BARGAIN they can on those ITEMS. All other _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;odds and ends_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; collected in the process are not necessarily BARGAINS as they may simply remain JUNK over the course of the game. All BARGAINS are worth positive points while JUNK is worth negative points. Each ROUND, however, players have the opportunity to turn potential JUNK back into BARGAINS. Whoever collects the most BARGAINS with the least JUNK, wins.</notes>
