Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Angola contains:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    2 decks of cards (110 total)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    32 page full-color rulebook_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    2 player aid cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; by 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; inch map _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    3 countersheets _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    4 six-sided dice_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Developer: Adam Starkweather_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Angola is a multi-player game in which players control the various Soviet- and US-backed factions that vied for control of Angola from 1975 to 1976. Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution.

    <notes>First edition by Ragnar Brothers
Game is in very good condition and has been verified as complete including the original instructions. Counters are uncut! Box has light shelf wear including some dishing to the box top one one corner of the box top has been taped but overall box is fine and serves its purpose
Note: this is the original edition by Ragnar Brothers. Components, especially the counters, are somewhat crude. The counters look like they have simply been printed on color paper and then glued to white cardboard, but these are the original ones</notes>

    <notes>This listing is NOT for the Angola game itself, but for a set of card sleeves for the Operations cards of the various factions, matched to the colour of factions in the MMP 2012 edition of Angola (please see photo).
Brand:  UltraPro (matte finish)
15 Red (MPLA 11), 15 Yellow (FAPLA 11), 15 Green (FNLA 11), 15 Blue (UNITA 12)
No. in brackets is the no. of Operation cards per faction.  This item includes a few extra cards as replacements.

    <notes>ANGOLA: Please note this is the Ragnar Brothers edition, not the MMP reprint. Collector_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy. Entirely uncut/unpunched. Box top lid has a slight mark in the top right corner (Photo: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/3407479/gobbeg) and is slightly warped and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sit flat. All contents in like new condition.  
For sale by old school gamer  selectively reducing his collection. All my games are stored in plastic bins in a climate controlled environment.
SHIPPING: When I ship I package thoroughly as if I were receiving the game myself. Please nominate preferred shipping method. USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail is generally a good way to go. I will combine games to save you shipping if you buy more than one from me. I will add only the actual shipping cost to the cost of the game.
PAYMENT: If paying by personal check, I will wait for the check to clear first before I ship the game.
ABOUT ME: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an old school gentleman seller, not a business. I take very good care of the games in my possession, describe them as they are, and package well when shipping. Please see my feedback on BGG Marketplace.</notes>
