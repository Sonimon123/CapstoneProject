   <description>Key Harvest is the fifth game in the key series of games published by R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;D Games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The object of the game is to score the most points.  Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board.  One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games or QWG Games - Key Harvest (Demetra)
Language: English _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; German
Players: 2 to 4
Age: 10+
Duration: about 90 min
Weight: 1,075 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: The object of the game in Key Harvest is to score the most points by placing tiles on their own country board. One point is scored for each field tile in the player’s largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group. Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board. The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile. Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles. When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action. Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands. There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player. A new game in the Key series, like the excellent Keythedral.

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition and has only been played once.
I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. This game will ship USPS priority mail, flat rate box. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.
Shipping cost is $10.00

The object of the game in Key Harvest is to score the most points. Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board. Each player has the same board, but there is only one of each tile, so there is competition when two players want the same tile. One point is scored for each field tile in the player’s largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 333)
 The object of the game in Key Harvest is to score the most points. Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board. Each player has the same board, but there is only one of each tile, so there is competition when two players want the same tile. One point is scored for each field tile in the player’s largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group. </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO333)
The object of the game in Key Harvest is to score the most points. Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board. Each player has the same board, but there is only one of each tile, so there is competition when two players want the same tile. One point is scored for each field tile in the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group. </notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>Condition: Complete game (no missing pieces). All components in good condition. Rules most likely will have handwritten clarifications on them.
Game price and Shipping cost depends on the 3 regions.
If you are in Canada, game price is in Canadian $ and shipping is 20 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, game price is in US $ and shipping is 30 US$.
If you are in EU, game price is in Euros and shipping is 80 Euros.
Shipping is the same for multiple items.
Payment: PayPal only.
My Paypal username is :
pnomikos@cogeco.ca
If you are in Canada, you pay in CDN$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in the USA, you pay in US$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in EU, you pay in Euros (game price and shipping).
Example:
The price of the game is 10$.
If you are in Canada, your total cost is 10+20=30 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, your total cost is 10+30=40 US$.
If you are in EU, your total cost is 10+80=90 Euros.</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English. RGG.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.

[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English. RGG.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).

[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
