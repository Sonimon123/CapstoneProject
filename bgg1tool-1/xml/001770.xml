   <description>Aliens allows players to recreate three key battle scenarios from the 1986 science fiction/horror film.  The scenarios include _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Reactor Room_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (nine marines vs. the aliens in their lair), _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Operations and Air Ducts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (the surviving marines face an alien assault and pursuit), and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Ripley vs. The Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; (Ripley uses a powerloader in her final battle with the Alien Queen).  Includes a 17_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game map, character cards, and counters, all featuring photos from the movie._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Marines can have very short life spans in this game, especially if they don't work together. Game play is fast and intense - does a good job of creating the sense of urgency felt when watching the movie.Missions can be made more brutal with optional rules - plus some rule variants add to some fun _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;what if_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; scenarios. Add the Aliens Expansion and you can virtually re-write the entire movie script!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I am selling both Alien and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expansion togther. There is some minor shelfware on the box. The contents are in excellent condition.
I am constantly striving to keep my collection to a manageable level (i.e. one that fits on my shelves!) and sadly Aliens is now using space that I need for newer purchases.
I will post in the UK using Special Delivery (to ensure it is covered for loss or damage) at a cost of Â£7.50.
I am also happy to post worldwide. 
Send me a geekmail if you would like any further information, or for non-uk postage prices.

(Postage included).
*** Aliens bundle: base game + expansion ***
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to describe the game as best as I can but feel free to ask for details if you want to. The set is 99% complete and entirely playable with only 3 counters (can be devised easily) and 4 plastic stands missing. 
The included Aliens Expansion is bagged individually, within the main box. 
Box itself has signs of shelf wear and the corners have been taped. Also small area of surface tear on the front cover where a price tag used to be. 
Condition/contents of main set: 
- Map in very good condition, with only a couple of tiny tears on the printed surface near-centre (not on playing area, not going through and not on the seams).
- Rulebook in great condition.
- All 16 character cards.
- 45 counters (missing 3): 18 aliens (instead of the 20/21), 2 facehuggers (instead of 3), 5 fire, 1 alien queen, 1 turn order, 1 door, 17 characters.
- 2D10
- 36 plastic stands (instead of 40 officially I think).
Condition/contents of expansion:
Rulebook, all 16 cards. Map in as new condition.

    <notes>This is a bundle of Aliens the board game (sealed), Aliens Expansion, and Aliens the Adventure Game.  There is some shelf wear on the Aliens Expansion and Adventure Game books.  The set is complete, no issues with the items.  To be clear, all of the products are by Leading Edge.  Buyer to pay for actual shipping.  Shipping to be provided by USPS at $16.75, which includes a delivery tracking number and insurance up to a $50 value.  Additional insurance available to cover the entire cost of the bundle, but need to pay an extra $5.50 to cover the insurance costs on top of the $16.75 shipping.  So the total with additional insurance would be $22.25.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the Aliens board game, the expansion, and 10 boxes of Leading Edge Alien metal miniatures that were made for this game.  I will try to accurately describe the condition of each component.
     I bought this game and expansion in used condition in the 90_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s, and then I bought up all of the miniatures that I could find so that I could make a custom game.  Unfortunately, nobody in my family was interested in playing so everything has just sat around.
     The box is taped on 2 sides and has normal shelf wear for a game of its age.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if the expansion came in a box, but the expansion was at the bottom of the Aliens game box and I wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even aware I had it until I started to inventory the components.
     I had the paper board for the game professionally laminated.  The board for the expansion is folded and looks like it was never used.  Both rulebooks are included, along with a rules summary booklet for the base game and some extra copies of the score sheets.  There are 2 glass markers that were added to the game (I am not sure what they are used for) and there is a 10-sided dice.  The dice is a very nice green and black high quality dice, so I am not sure if it was the original dice that came with the game.
     If you do not use the miniatures, there are 45 black plastic stands and 47 cardboard characters to go in the stands.  They are functional but very worn, which is why I bought the miniatures.  There are 16 cardboard character cards with the character info on them, and 16 cardboard room/sentry/alien square cards that I am not sure what they are used for.  The expansion said there were room cards, but I am not sure if these are it or if they went to the base game (unfortunately, when nobody was interested I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really research the rules or set-up of the game).  There is a cardboard combat table.
     I will describe the miniatures as best I can, but if you have questions please email.  All 10 of the boxes (they are sturdy black plastic cases that snap shut and have 2 layers of foam in each box) are not shrinkwrapped, but they are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition - the Aliens are not assembled and they are unpainted - the marines, Ripley, Newt, etc are unpainted (they are one-piece miniatures).  I have the following miniatures:
- Colonists Last Stand
- Queen_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Lair
- Power Loader
- Alien Warriors Set #1   *I have 3 boxes of these to have many aliens to use for the game*
- Alien Warriors  Set #2
- Colonial Marines   Set #1
- Colonial Marines    Set #2
- another box of Colonial Marines that have extras in it (I think the extras were either bought individually or 2 boxes were put in one)</notes>

    <notes>Leading Edge English edition.  Components are complete and in great shape.  The box has some dishing, typical for this game, since the cardboard isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t very thick.  Just some minor whitening on the corners.  Looks very good overall.
Shipping is to the USA at the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense from 97355.</notes>
