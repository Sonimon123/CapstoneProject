   <description>Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- to roll and move again and also collect points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Edel, Stein _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Reich_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This copy of the game has only been played once, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in great shape after all of these years.
Game contents have been verified.  All components (including extra gems) are in the game box.  Insert is in excellent shape (even if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s useless.)
The front page of the rules have a very slight red smudge on it near the title part of the page (upper left).  Otherwise the rules are just fine.  (I think the rules came that way when I opened the box.)
The game box is in very good condition.  If you look closely, you can see a minor dent here and there from other boxes being on top of this.
Game comes from a non-smoking home.</notes>
