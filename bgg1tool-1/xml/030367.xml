   <description>This game is set in the Perry Rhodan universe, a hugely popular German space-opera book series published since 1961. The term _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;kosmisch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; means _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;cosmic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Hanse_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; refers to the Hanseatic League, a Medieval trade network in Northern Europe. In the american translation of the book series the phrase _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Die Kosmische Hanse_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; was translated as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Cosmic House_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this game the players take on the roles of traders who transport goods between planets. Occasionally one can carry also passengers, which brings additional yields. Players can invest in cargo space, transmitters or faster drives to improve their spaceships._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Heinrich Glumpler, the designer of the game, is a fan of Merchant of Venus, as you can see from this comment._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The artwork is by Swen Papenbrock, one of the illustrators of the Perry Rhodan book series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game is part of the Kosmos two-player series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; Game Summary_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Place the 6 planet cards in a line. The goods cards are double-sided; randomize them, then place several on each planet grouped by type (but no more than 2/type/planet to start). Each has their own deck, shuffled; draw 5 card hand. The cards are mostly tech cards, which can give you ongoing power; or single-use cards (counter opponent's card by playing matching card yourself). Each player begins with one card in play. This card gives each player one container and one replenishment. One player decides whether to go first or choose on which planet both planets will start. The other player gets the other option._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On one's turn a player may do these actions in any order:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Flight_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Two Interventions (play cards that don't have the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;infin; on them)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Take two Planetary Actions (load, unload, or buy an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;infin; card)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When a player unloads, the delivered cards are flipped over; any resulting matches are removed from game -- works as a game timer!

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4062)
As commanders of the Cosmic League, the players use their spaceships to transport goods and passengers between the six planets. For this they receive a certain number of Megagalax (1 Megagalax equals 1,000,000 Galax, the currency unit of the Cosmic League). The players may spend the earned Megagalax to buy technologies to facilitate their tasks. But they must not forget the main objective of the game because the first player who reaches a total of 70 Megagalax will win the game.
A strategic two player game set in one of the most prolific and best selling universes in science fiction. Discover Perry Rhodan and the Cosmic League for yourself!

    <notes>Zman Games - Perry Rhodan: The Cosmic League
Language: English
Players: 2
Age: 10+
Duration: about 30 min
Weight: 0.400 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: This game is set in the Perry Rhodan universe, a hugely popular German space-opera book series published since 1961. The term _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;kosmisch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; means _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;cosmic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; whereby _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Hanse_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; refers to the Hanseatic League, a Medieval trade network in Northern Europe. In the american translation of the book series the term _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Die Kosmische Hanse_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; was translated as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The Cosmic House_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. In this game the players take on the roles of traders who transport goods between planets. Occasionally one can carry also passengers, which brings additional yields. Players can invest in cargo space, transmitters or faster drives to improve their spaceships.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 4062)
As commanders of the Cosmic League, the players use their spaceships to transport goods and passengers between the six planets. For this they receive a certain number of Megagalax (1 Megagalax equals 1,000,000 Galax, the currency unit of the Cosmic League). The players may spend the earned Megagalax to buy technologies to facilitate their tasks. But they must not forget the main objective of the game because the first player who reaches a total of 70 Megagalax will win the game.
A strategic two player game set in one of the most prolific and best selling universes in science fiction. Discover Perry Rhodan and the Cosmic League for yourself!</notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG4062)
As commanders of the Cosmic League, the players use their spaceships to transport goods and passengers between the six planets. For this they receive a certain number of Megagalax (1 Megagalax equals 1,000,000 Galax, the currency unit of the Cosmic League). The players may spend the earned Megagalax to buy technologies to facilitate their tasks. But they must not forget the main objective of the game because the first player who reaches a total of 70 Megagalax will win the game. A strategic two player game set in one of the most prolific and best selling universes in science fiction. Discover Perry Rhodan and the Cosmic League for yourself! </notes>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG4062)
As commanders of the Cosmic League, the players use their spaceships to transport goods and passengers between the six planets. For this they receive a certain number of Megagalax (1 Megagalax equals 1,000,000 Galax, the currency unit of the Cosmic League). The players may spend the earned Megagalax to buy technologies to facilitate their tasks. But they must not forget the main objective of the game because the first player who reaches a total of 70 Megagalax will win the game. A strategic two player game set in one of the most prolific and best selling universes in science fiction. Discover Perry Rhodan and the Cosmic League for yourself! </notes>
