   <description>From the publisher's website:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Allies Pacific is the second stand-alone game expansion to the Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies game system. In this game, three main powers (Britain, Japan, and the US) square off against each other against the backdrop of the Pacific ocean. Japan is trying to grow her empire, either through military might or by holding off the Allies long enough to consolidate her gains._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game adds a few new rules and a few new twists to the established A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;A game system. Naval bases and air bases turn small, meaningless islands into vital strategic holdings. Convoy zones allow a single submarine pack to cripple an economy. The Chinese forces, while limited, are hard to crush. Japan gets her kamikazes, but will it be enough to hold off the vast economic power of the USA?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Avalon Hill (AVH 41388 / WOC 41388000B)
December 7, 1941
Japan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s great fleet is poised to launch the most infamous surprise attack in history. Their target--the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In the weeks to come, more humiliating losses will add to the sting of Allied defeats--Hong Kong, Malaya, the Philippines, Java.
Axis and Allies: Pacific invites you to determine the future of the Pacific! How will the Americans respond to Japan_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s onslaught? Counterattack or careful rebuilding? Will they battle their way across the ocean island by island, or try striking directly at the heart of the Japanese empire? With the rich resources of the East Indies under its control, Japan could become unbeatable. Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t overlook China and Burma; your enemy certainly won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t.
Naval strategy and wise economic moves are both critical in waging this far-flung war across an entire hemisphere. To the familiar elements from Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies, Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies: Pacific adds convoys, island air and naval bases, kamikazes, destroyers, and the Chinese army. You also get almost 350 playing pieces representing the actual tanks, planes, and ships involved, not just generic bombers and aircraft carriers!
The fate of the Pacific is in your hands. Good luck!
Includes 335 historically accurate weapons and game pieces!

    <notes>The plastic figure bags have been opened.  The pieces have been punched from the cardboard.  However, the game has never been played.
All pieces have been accounted for (that took quite a while to do!!) and are in individual bags to prevent from spilling all over the place.  The IPCs are still shrinkwrapped.
The outside game box is in excellent shape.  There are beginning signs of wear and tear on the game box.  (This game has been sitting around for many years now.)  The beginning signs of wear and tear are concentrated around some of the box corners (barely visible).
This game comes from a non-smoking house.
I am also selling A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Europe and A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A D-Day.  Please see my listings for those items.</notes>

    <notes>Avalon Hill - Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific
Language: English
Players: 2 to 3
Age: 12+
Duration: 60 to 120 min
Weight: 1.950 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies Pacific is the second stand-alone game expansion to the Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies game system. In this game, three main powers (Britain, Japan, and the US) square off against each other against the backdrop of the Pacific ocean. Japan is trying to grow her empire, either through military might or by holding off the Allies long enough to consolidate her gains. The game adds a few new rules and a few new twists to the established A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A game system. Naval bases and air bases turn small, meaningless islands into vital strategic holdings. Convoy zones allow a single submarine pack to cripple an economy. The Chinese forces, while limited, are hard to crush. Japan gets her kamikazes, but will it be enough to hold off the vast economic power of the USA?

    <notes>Game is in good condition and looks to have all the parts.  The only items in question are the national control markers for Australia - there are only 2 of them.  Not sure if there should be more and I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t found an inventory that indicates how many of those it should have.

    <notes>This is from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Crate Full of Games Auction_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; specifically for Jhonna Niver (Kytty).
The components are in like-new condition, fully intact, inventoried, and bagged. The box has a fair amount of shelf wear, some of the corners are dinged/slightly torn, but is sound. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this game has ever been played.

    <notes>NOTE: You will need a base edition of Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies (preferably  AH edition for destroyers and artillery) to play this because it does not come with the box, plastic pieces, or dice.  You will receive the game board, rules, and battle mat.  You will need to substitute the Russians from regular A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A to be the US Marines.  I also have A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Europe in the same condition and would not charge additional shipping if both were bought.  See A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Europe for my listing.</notes>

    <notes>Shrink removed and pieces sorted, but other than that I consider it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. It has never been played. There is some insignificant shelf wear on the box only visible through close inspection. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing shipping will be around $15 but it depends on your location and any special handling you desire.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but never played, pristine condition, except some very minor shelf wear on the box corners.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 85oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order, but expect it to be about $15 total). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.

    <notes>Condition - In shrink wrap, box in new condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a very large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
