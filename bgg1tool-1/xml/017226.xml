   <description>Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord. Up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure. One player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon's many traps, puzzles, and monsters._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The heroes' goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario. If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win. The Overlord's objective is simply to use all the means at his or her disposal - from deadly traps and ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes. Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) (2012)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping within Canada is $8 for small board games (munchkin, carcassonne, settlers) $10 for medium games (shadows over camelot, arkham, talisman) and $14 for large games (WoW, Twilight Imperium, Descent)  US Customers add $2. If you place an order without contacting me first, use this as a guideline for what to send for shipping I am very easy to deal with if there is an error with payment we will work something out 
ALL ITEMS LISTED ship within 48 hours with tracking info within Canada and to the United States.

    <notes>Due to hard times, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m forced to sell some treasured games.
This package includes not only the base game, but also Well of Darkness, Altar of Despair and Road to Legend. All games have been played, but are in excellent condition. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this collection for about half retail.
Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask me to break apart this collection. It would be very difficult to determine which units/cards go with which expansion. Sold as a set.
NO SHIPPING. This is a very heavy set of games though, so I think shipping would be out of the question. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m thinking, realistically speaking, this is for pick up only. I live in Port Townsend, Washington state. So if you live in the Puget Sound region or Olympic Peninsula, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your chance to get a whole lotta game for just a little dosh.
Please contact me with any questions you might have.
Thanks for reading.

Shipping is to be paid by buyer and will be either by priority mail with delivery confirmation or, more likely to get a better pricing, by UPS Ground shipment.</notes>

    <notes>Shrinkwrap opened, counters punched and separated into ziplock bags. Beside that, everything is unplayed and in near mint to mint condition. Box may have some very minor wear but it is not noticeable.
In another words, this is like a brand new set, without the shrinkwrap and the need to punching the counters etc. The game looks like it is just out of a shrinkwraped copy...
Buyer pays actual shipping (this is a very big box, I will throw in the packaging), plus a couples of nickles and dimes to cover gas.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - Descent: Journey in the Dark
Language: English
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 13+
Duration: 2 to 4 hour
Weight: 4.020 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord. Up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure. One player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s many traps, puzzles, and monsters. The heroes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario. If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win. The Overlord_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s objective is simply to use all the means at his or her disposal - from deadly traps and ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes. Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins.

    <notes>Game has been opened, pieces punched, insert removed, but the game is unplayed. Game comes from a pet and smoke free home. Exterior box shows extremely minor wear.
Also the game includes the Road TO Legends expansion which is in the Descent Journeys in the dark box, threw away the Road to Legend box. Components for Road to legend are still in shrink wrap. Great game for someone that wants to jump into the system.
Any additional questions please ask. Buyer is responsible for all shipping and paypal costs (3.9%). Thank you and check out my other sales.</notes>

    <notes>English version. Only played a couple times. All parts included. Two of the spiders are broken off their bases but could easily be glued or even replaced by the manufacturer if you ask nicely (they are badly designed and flimsy to begin with). Were it not for these two pieces, I would list this as like new. This game retails new for $89.95. I will ship anywhere but check with me for shipping cost before you buy. Domestic postage (USPS Parcel Post) will run about $14.00.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - Descent: Journey in the Dark
Language: English
Players: 2 to 5
Age: 13+
Duration: 2 to 4 hour
Weight: 4.020 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord. Up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure. One player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s many traps, puzzles, and monsters. The heroes_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario. If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win. The Overlord_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s objective is simply to use all the means at his or her disposal - from deadly traps and ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes. Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins.

Contains all the parts, rules and cards, all of which are in excellent condition (well, rules show a little wear). I bought this game second hand but have counted all the pieces and they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re all there. They look like it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never been played!

    <notes>This is for a lot:
Descent Journeys in the Dark
Road to Legends
Altar of Despair
Well of Darkness.
The base set has been played a few times, the other sets have not been played at all. This set is in fantastic condition. I do not have all of the original boxes but I do have the large base box and at least one of the smaller ones. I will include whichever ones I still have.
This set also comes with a COMPLETE second set of tiles for all of the expansions. So you will get almost 2 FULL SETS OF THE TILES, from every expansion except the sea of blood.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and all the pieces are bagged.  The game has been played a few times, and shows some wear on the corners of the box.  The only other issue with this copy are the rule books, which clearly have been thumbed through quite a few times.  Other than that this game is in fantastic condition.
Buyer pays for shipping, we will discuss how you would like the game sent and you will pay for the cost of shipping.  You can also pick the game up in the Baltimore, Gaithersburg, Germantown or Hagerstown areas.</notes>

    <notes>Original owner, non smoking household.
 
Game is complete except for insert. Cards and bits are sorted and placed in zip lock bags and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included an extra plano style plastic storage container for additionally sorting and storing pieces. All are in excellent conditon.
 
Box has a small/minor (approximatley 1.5 inch long dent / tear on top left side) and some minor corner wear. Aside from that it looks very clean and bright all over. 
The game was played exactly twice and if it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t for the small amount of box damage I would have rated it _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;...but as you will see from my seller ratings, I am fair and honest to do business with.
 
The game is large and heavy and shipping will be a little more than for most games.

    <notes>Barely, if ever, played.  In great condition, although two of the corners of the box have been taped. (They don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear to have been damaged, but I hesitate to remove the tape and thereby damage the corners!) (We were pretty obsessive about keeping our games awesome.)

    <notes>This is for the FIRST version of Descent.
The box is pretty beat up. Three corners of the lid have been split and repaired. The components are in excellent shape and all cards have been sleeved.
This is a big box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve estimated the shipping to be $25.00 for the continental US. If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cheaper then I will reduce the price. Shipping to anywhere else will more. I will ship outside of the US but the full shipping price will be the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s responsibility. Finally, no refunds if shipped outside the US and the package is lost.
Other payment note: I will accept Amazon Payments as a preferred alternative to Paypal. I will give 5% off if you use Amazon Payments.

    <notes>This is *only* for certain left over monster miniatures which will help you if you need to fill out your 2nd edition conversion kit.
See here for details on how they will be useful for you: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/84452/first-edition-leftover-monsters
Bane Spider: 2 master, 4 regular (more than you need)
Beastman: 2 master, 2 regular (exactly what you need)
Blood Ape: 1 master, 2 regular (exactly what you need)
Dark Priest: 1 master, 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Deep Elf: 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Ferrox: 1 regular (25% of what you need)
Hellhound: 1 master, 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Ice Wyrm: 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Kobold: 2 master (you need as many as 15 theoretically)
Lava Beetle: 1 master, 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Manticore: 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Razorwing: 1 master, 1 regular (50% of what you need)
Shade: 1 master (20% of what you need)
Skeleton Archer: 2 master (25% of what you could need at max)
Sorcerer: 1 master (20% of what you could need at max)
Troll: 1 regular (50% of what you need)
You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll notice that if you find one other person like me selling these leftovers, you will be able to fully fill out many of the monsters in the conversion kit for Descent 2nd Edition.  Note that in order to get the right mix of master/non-master you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to repaint some red ones white (or just paint the whole minis anyways).
(Note: I have already sold my extra Golem, 1 Beastman, and 1 Kobold, but this is reflected in the numbers above)</notes>

    <notes>This includes Descent: Journeys in the Dark First Edition as well as the following:
The Well of Darkness
The Altar of Despair
The Road to Legend
The Tomb of Ice
The Sea of Blood
As this game includes hundreds of separate components, it is difficult to succinctly describe its condition. Overall, the game is in good condition with all boxes, minis, cards and other components present.
The condition of the expansions is very good. Most components are in punched-but-unplayed condition. The boxes have moderate shelf wear.
The base game has clearly seen some use. The overlord cards have edge wear, which is pictured. Some of the tiles have wear present where they interlock. The lid for the main game has several split corners.
Shipping of this item will be very expensive, as it is both large and heavy.</notes>

    <notes>Base game of Descent 1 plus the following expansions:
Descent: The Road to Legend
Descent: The Well of Darkness
Descent: The Altar of Despair
Descent: The Tomb of Ice
This is a huge package and I will include the 3 ft tall Stanley rolling tool case which I cart it all around in (probably $50 value).
I will also include the multiple plastic boxes which are currently keeping many of the chits organized (probably $30 value).
Important note, some (10-20) of the miniatures have been painted by a friend of mine. They look pretty decent, not professional grade. A few of them have just been primed.
Condition: Very Good to Good.  Boxes are showing wear, but all actual components are doing well.
I would greatly prefer to deliver this somewhere in Massachusetts for cash.  I will still be paying BGG their fee because I think this is a great site.
If you are not in MA and want it shipped to you, understand that it would be very very expensive by my guess.
If someone is actually interested in purchasing this, I can take some photos to share.</notes>

    <notes>This giant box was well cared for, but still had some corners threatening to split - now repaired with tape on the inside.
Contents are all there, most stored in Plano boxes, baggies, etc...  I think three figures had an issue which I then fixed so that it is not noticeable to a casual observer.
All in all, very good shape for a game with such a pile of plastic in such a huge box...
I am ALSO selling a like-new (cards still in shrink) copy of the Road to Legends expansion.  Buy both and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cut a deal on shipping.
*NOTE: Will ship to other countries, but shipping cost WILL BE GREATER!  (This is a huge game, and it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship worldwide for $20...  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not gonna gouge you on shipping but be aware it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still expensive...)</notes>

    <notes>Box has a very small amount of shelf wear and almost looks new. All the bits are accounted for and in Plano boxes (1 for players, 1 for overlord). I sometimes am called away to work but communication will be often as I update you on the shipping date if I happen to be out of town for a few days.
Played 2 times.
I am open to removing the stuff from the box and packing it all in a priority mail box to decrease shipping cost if you do not need the game box.</notes>

    <notes>First edition from 2005.  All game components (especially the hero and monster figures) are in mint condition.  Tokens are 97% complete, only missing 14 tokens out of 450: one healing potion token (9 of 10), one miscellaneos marker token (skye the falcon - 5 of 6), one glyph token (9 of 10), one conquest token (23 of 24), 4 threat tokens (28 of 32), 2 wound tokens (53 of 55), 4 fatigue tokens (20 of 24).  None of the missing tokens affect gameplay and would not be missed (except the skye the falcon token which can be replaced).  Box has one split corner and several tears which have been repaired.  </notes>

    <notes>This game is in very good shape, and I have carefully counted to make sure everything is still accounted for. (Plus an extra red sorcerer for some reason. Ooo, bonus!) The box has some wear in the corners and the instructions show some use, but they are all still structurally sound. All the playing pieces and figures are in nearly new condition. I have included images to show the box and to show the partially packed pieces, all carefully counted and bagged for quick confirmation after you receive it. It is all carefully boxed with adequate padding and I can typically ship it within 24 hours of payment. I will pass on the actual shipping cost. Rough estimates for shipping are $25 for standard, and $33 for priority mail. (It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s over 9 lbs.) Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks.</notes>

* I ship worldwide, but shipping outside Belgium will be rather expensive as the shipping will be registered and this collection weighs a lot. 
* As I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not a professional seller, please allow a few days to search for packing materials, wrapping the games and shipping.
* Please PM me for questions or single item purchase offers I cannot refuse.

    <notes>Game in excellent condition, only ever played it three times.  But that being said, those three times were epic, awesome, and memorable.  I bought this new back in 2008.
I wish I had more time to play it, but my wife and I recently had a baby and I cannot game for hours on end like I used to be able to.  I will enjoy this game vicariously through the others who carry on the epic tradition.  I hope you enjoy.</notes>

    <notes>Well, I hate to have to get rid of it because its the most fun looking game I have and makes me feel like a kid just looking at the box. But with a couple kids now I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see my wife and friends and I ever having the time to get through it again. Its a long game, very long, but very fun. We only played it three times.
So, everything is here and well cared for. The figures are bagged and all of the chits are organized in a plastic craft container box. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including the craft box and trust me you want it. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re really picky about how your games look, like I am, here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the parts you want to pay attention to. I thought I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d try my hand at painting some of the figures. I got 6 skeletons primed, and 3 of those fully painted and then realized how foolish I was for thinking I wanted to paint. We never played again after that but later I went back and stripped all of the paint off of them and it mostly worked. The 3 that were primed look almost like original with an occasional speck of gray. Not bad. The 3 that were painted came clean as well but anything that was painted brown sort of stained the mini. Its light, but noticeable.
The hero figures were tough for me to determine who was who when we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d set up for play. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a lot of them. So I took a fine tipped sharpie and wrote the names of the heroes on the underside of their bases. Not noticeable in play.
A few of the mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are fragile. One of the spiders was popped off its base when I got it new but it easily reseated. When I got the game out to check it over (been in storage for 6 years) 2 more spiders had popped off. I super-glued them back on and they look like new. So just be aware, it can happen but a little glue does the trick.
Other than that everything is in super shape. Box is still very nice with only a small tear/scratch on one side. I have extensive pics of it all so please shoot me a message so you can take a look at them and decide for yourself. Please message me with any questions you might have and thanks for browsing. Hopefully you can give this amazing box of fun stuff some more play.
And P.S., this is obviously the first edition big box. Its big, its heavy. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure what its going to cost to ship but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be relatively high. If you happen to live in the Charlotte, NC area we can meet up for face to face delivery and save shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Complete 1st edition of Descent JitD. Includes all expansions and Quest Compendium. 
Base game - new, expanded, but never played
Sea of Blood - new, expanded, but never played
Tomb of Ice - new, expanded, played just few times
Road to Legend - new, expanded from foil, but unpeeled tokens, never played
Altar of Despair - new, expanded, played once
Well of Darkness - expanded, missing heroes (figures and cards), all other miniatures and game material in 100% condition
Ques Compendium - Totally new, just readed once
I choose Very Good condition because most of content is absolutely new (just removed from shrink wrap. Only missing six heroes from Well of Darkness expansion (there are still more than 40 in editon so it did not hinder me). Otherwise in 100% condition.
Base game and all expansions are in their own boxes :) Not even one box missing. Miniatures are not painted. I can add few plastic binders.
Postage will be calculated from Czech Republic using Czech post. I can send you photos to email - I will snap it for you if you will want it.
Money to by bank account in advance or cash on delivery. Best woud be personal taking in Czech Rep. - Prague, but I will send it by post as well.

    <notes>Heavy-hearted I am parting from my first edition of Descent  (EN).
This package includes:
- Descent: Journeys in the Dark
- Descent: The Altar of Despair
- Descent: The Road to Legend
- Descent: The Sea of Blood
- Descent: The Tomb of Ice
- Descent: The Well of Darkness
- Sea of Blood card board map
All components are present (I did not cross-check each an every one but I am quite sure) and in very good condition but I used the boxes to sort them (e.g. the miniatures are in one box, cards in another, etc.). You can see this in the pictures.  Well of Darkness box is not included, I threw it away to save space. But all the components and the rulebook are included. The main game box is a bit damaged (two corners are ruptured) but this is the only damage.
Please note that the total weight of everything is more than 10kg. This means shipping costs will be higher. Probably I will split it into two packages to reduce the shipping costs.
Pickup possible in Frankfurt, Germany
Bank Transfer and cash on pickup are also possible as a payment methods.</notes>

This item includes Descent: Journeys in the Dark (base game) along with Well of Darkness, Altar of Despair, Road to Legend, and Tomb of Ice expansions.  Also includes a binder with summary rules print outs for the Road to Legend campaign.  All components are present and accounted for. I separated them, as best I could, into the sets they originally came with based on the somewhat vague components list in the game manuals. All boxes are present, but any inserts that may have once been included have been discarded.</notes>

Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
Note that this title is only available from me as part of a package that also includes the Sea of Blood expansion (listed for sale separately in the BGG Marketplace (see https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1152470).
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Played once and in excellent shape.
Box shows almost no shelfwear.  Hard-find copy that does not have any split corners.  Game components are complete and in excellent shape.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

    <notes>This is 1st edition Descent and Includes Road to Legend AND Well of Darkness expansions.  Neither expansion box are present (Ditched them during a move with limited space).  Damage to the exterior box, and 1-2 minis.  Otherwise perfectly playable and complete (in other words I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t done a complete inventory, so there might be a small piece here or there missing but nothing crucial or anything that would render the game difficult to play). Message me if you have questions or would like a picture.</notes>

Yes, I will do local pickup.  
Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.
