Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom
Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom is a 1-4 player cooperative miniatures board game that includes over 65 highly detailed miniature figures! The game combines the concept of a tactical combat board game with the flexibility of an intricate card game. Acclaimed designers by Adam and Brady Sadler have developed a streamlined system that focuses on modularity and action, with fighters, bosses, rivals, allies, and stages forming a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;sandbox_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for players to mix and match, creating their own epic showdowns.
The game offers both an action packed _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Arcade Mode_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; where players completely customize their own experience with any combination of fighters, bosses, and stages, as well as a narrative campaign _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Story Mode_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; where the fighters_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; victories, defeats, and choices help unravel the lore of the game. In _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Story Mode_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; victory means helpful perks, while defeat inflicts dangerous penalties.
