   <description>In Chrononauts, each player becomes a time traveler, with a unique identity and a secret mission. During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally...the one you must return to in order to win? It's all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This includes the Lost Identities expansion.  Complete, in very nice condition, played about four times but always shuffled by me, and I pile shuffle so there has been no backbending on the cards at all.  Box has minor wear, but otherwise this is about as good as new.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGGM but have lots of ebay feedback (see _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;jon.waddington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;).</notes>

    <notes>Still in its shrink, this is a great game to learn history (even if it is “alternate” history), while having a blast.  I have a copy already, but then won a second copy.  I just don’t need a second one.  I’ll ship anywhere in the continental U.S. for $5, and anywhere in the world for shipping plus $2.
Also, to save shipping, check out my other games (here are some of them): 10 Days in Africa, 10 Days in the USA, Aggravation (Co-5 company), Anachronism (various sets), Apples to Apples Junior 9+, Apples to Apples Junior!, Apples to Apples Expansion Set #1, Barbarian (double game with Survival), Before I Kill You Mr. Bond, Bible Challenge, Bitin’ Off Hedz, Brain Strain, Brawl, Campaign, Caesar and Cleopatra, Caveat Emptor, Cheers, Chrononauts, Circus Maximus (Battleline), Civilization (Avalon Hill), Deadwood, Desert Victory, Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix, Dilbert, Gangsters Gun Molls and G-Men, Gold Digger, Grab!, Hack!

The Card Game of Time Travel
136 full-color playing cards, and a rulebook, in a thick tuck box 
for 1-6 players 
20-45 minutes 
ages 11 and up 
In Chrononauts, each player becomes a time traveler, with a unique identity and a secret mission. During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally... the one you must return to in order to win? It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again. </notes>

The graphics are different and only in black, white, and red instead of full colors.  I only got to play it a couple of times before I bought the retail version, so the cards are still in great condition.  Cards only, no box or rules.</notes>

What would YOU do with a Time Machine? Would you stop the sinking of the Titanic? Prevent the assassination of JFK? Kill Hitler before WWII? These are just a few of the possibilities in Chrononauts, the award-winning card game of time travel. To win, you must change history at key points called Linchpins, so that history transforms into the Alternate Reality your character calls home. You can also win by collecting a specific set of Artifacts, such as a live dinosaur, the Mona Lisa, and an unpublished Shakespearean play. But be careful - if you create too many paradoxes, you could destroy the entire universe! </notes>

    <notes>Looney Labs (LOO 009)
What would YOU do with a Time Machine? Would you stop the sinking of the Titanic? Prevent the assassination of JFK? Kill Hitler before WWII? These are just a few of the possibilities in Chrononauts, the award-winning card game of time travel. To win, you must change history at key points called Linchpins, so that history transforms into the Alternate Reality your character calls home. You can also win by collecting a specific set of Artifacts, such as a live dinosaur, the Mona Lisa, and an unpublished Shakespearean play. But be careful - if you create too many paradoxes, you could destroy the entire universe</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Chrononauts
Description: Chrononauts card game from Looney Labs. Complete and in good shape.
Shipping Weight: 1 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

What would YOU do with a Time Machine? Would you stop the sinking of the Titanic? Prevent the assassination of JFK? Kill Hitler before WWII? These are just a few of the possibilities in Chrononauts, the award-winning card game of time travel. To win, you must change history at key points called Linchpins, so that history transforms into the Alternate Reality your character calls home. You can also win by collecting a specific set of Artifacts, such as a live dinosaur, the Mona Lisa, and an unpublished Shakespearean play. But be careful - if you create too many paradoxes, you could destroy the entire universe! </notes>
