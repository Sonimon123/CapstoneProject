   <description>In Mondo, players compete against each other while also racing against the clock. Each player has a small world board with empty spaces on it, and all players simultaneously pick tiles depicting different animals and environments from the middle of the table and place them on their world board, trying to create complete areas of the same environment. A new tile must be placed next to an already placed tile, but the environmental borders don't have to match. (These errors will earn negative points when the board is scored.)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When the timer runs out, players score bonus points for each animal and each completed environment and score negative points for volcanic tiles, empty fields on the world board and mismatched tiles (for example, a tile with a forest border connecting with a tile with a water border)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Mondo includes three degrees of difficulty, in addition to additional goals and ways to achieve (and lose) bonus points, as well as rules for solo play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7081)
Mondo is a real-time puzzle building game designed by Michael Schacht, and can be played by between 1 and 4 players.  On each turn players use one hand to draw tiles from a central pile and place them, either side up, on their world board. Each tile drawn and played, must
be placed against a tile already in place on the board. Players will be scoring points for creating mistake free landscapes - so a forest will score points only if it is fully enclosed and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include any mistakes. Players also score points for animals present on the board, and for the order in which they opt out of a turn. Players also need to be mindful of the ways in which they can lose points: any landscape tile placed that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t match up with those next to it will score minus 1 point, and the player with the most active volcanoes will also score minus points! After three turns the game is finished and the player with the highest points wins the day.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG7081)
Mondo is a real-time puzzle building game designed by Michael Schacht, and can be played by between 1 and 4 players. On each turn players use one hand to draw tiles from a central pile and place them, either side up, on their world board. Each tile drawn and played, must be placed against a tile already in place on the board. Players will be scoring points for creating mistake free landscapes - so a forest will score points only if it is fully enclosed and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t include any mistakes. Players also score points for animals present on the board, and for the order in which they opt out of a turn. Players also need to be mindful of the ways in which they can lose points: any landscape tile placed that doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t match up with those next to it will score minus 1 point, and the player with the most active volcanoes will also score minus points! After three turns the game is finished and the player with the highest points wins the day. </notes>
