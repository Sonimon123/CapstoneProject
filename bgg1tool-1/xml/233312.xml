   <description>Stuffed Fables is an unusual adventure game in which players take on the roles of brave stuffies seeking to save the child they love from a scheming, evil mastermind. Make daring melee attacks, leap across conveyor belts, or even steer a racing wagon down a peril-filled hill. The game delivers a thrilling narrative driven by player choices. Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking curious discoveries. The chapters of Stuffed Fables explore the many milestones of a child's life, creating a memorable tale ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven't forgotten their childlike sense of wonder._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Stuffed Fables is the first _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;AdventureBook Game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, a new product line from Plaid Hat Games in which all of the action takes place in the unique storybook _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one! Each adventure in the game takes place over several pages of the immersive AdventureBook. The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Stuffed Fables™ An AdventureBook™ Game
Stuffed Fables is an AdventureBook™ Game – an exciting new product line from Plaid Hat Games. In an AdventureBook™ Game all of the action takes place in the unique storybook – a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one!
Sworn to protect the little girl that loves them, a group of stuffed toys has been drawn into the Fall, an otherworldly, fantastic realm ruled by a brooding master of nightmares.
Stuffed Fables is a unique adventure game in which players take on the roles of brave stuffies seeking to save the child they love from a scheming, evil mastermind. Players roll and assign color-coded dice to perform a wide variety of actions, from daring melee attacks, to leaping across conveyor belts, or steering a racing wagon down a peril-filled hill.
Stuffed Fables delivers an exciting narrative adventure driven by player choices. Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking unique discoveries as they interact with the story. Stuffed Fables is ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven’t forgotten their childlike sense of wonder.
Each adventure in Stuffed Fables takes place over several pages of the immersive Storybook. The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.
On her turn, a player draws 5 dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!
White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations.
Players can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.

    <notes>Description: Stuffed Fables (English) in excellent shape.
Shipping Weight:  7 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Bought new and played part of Story 1 with my daughter but she wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a fan so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just been on the shelf since. Basically brand new and in a pet and smoke free home. 
Box will fit snuggly into a medium flat rate box ($13.65) but there won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be room for additional padding. 
A large flat rate box ($18.90) will allow for wrapping in bubble wrap. Buyer chooses which option they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like.
Will ship within 24 hours of purchase.</notes>

    <notes>I would say Like New, because I received it as such with a small 1 inch part on the seam of the dice bag at the top where it has come unsewn, but I do not want to mislead. It still functions 100 percent. The game was played twice by respectful children and stored in a smoke free, pet free home. Everything is included as well as some extra plastic bags to organize things. All pieces are present and in prestine condition.</notes>
