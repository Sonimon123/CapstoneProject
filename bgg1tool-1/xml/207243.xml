   <description>This world used to be a garden full of life; from the flying Vadora to the deep-dwelling Dwarves _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but that was before Vesh came. The world has been lost and only one city remains; the oldest city in the world _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and the last refuge for all of us. Now... we fight back._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The City of Kings is a cooperative tactical roleplaying board game for 1 - 4 players in which your character is tasked with exploring the hazardous world, trading for vital resources, and battling your enemies whilst uncovering a story of a world imperiled._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You start by choosing one of seven stories or twelve scenarios, then select your hero, with each of the six heroes featuring twelve unique skills and nine customizable stats that allow you to specialize in attacking, healing, tanking, worker management, or whatever you desire. Aside from your hero, you need to manage your workers, who must gather resources in order to trade for new items and build structures to gain powerful bonuses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You explore across the Ageless Realms by turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders and creatures as you continue to power up whilst preparing to enter Azure Rise._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At its heart, The City of Kings is a complex puzzle featuring endless strategic battles. Each creature is generated from a pool of spells, characteristics and stats offering over 10,000,000 unique battle situations. There are no dice, damage is persistent, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s up to you to customize your characters and work together to come up with a strategy to defeat whoever stands in your way._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>DELUXE EDITION. Like new. Played a few solo games. Punched and sorted so you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have to! That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll save you over an hour in this case. :)
Shipping will be via USPS, the cost of which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to determine once I know the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ZIP code. For reference, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a 13 lb. box shipping from 99353. It won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be cheap, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll charge you the exact amount that I pay. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll also be including $200 insurance as part of the shipping cost, which is usually a few bucks.</notes>

    <notes>Adventurer version NOT the Deluxe version. I played it once and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not my thing.
This box was missing the scavenge dice. These replacements are on the way and will be forwarded on to you without additional shipping charges. I was able to play the game perfectly well using a normal 6 sided die. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw some in for you if you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have any.

Shipping and Paypal fees not included in the price. Due to the size/weight of the game probably sending outside UK might be quite expensive.</notes>

New,Opened, unplayed.
Started punching with intent to learn the rules, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have time for another game of this size so selling it for now.
I have done a quick components check, nothing appears to be missing. Majority of the game is still unpunched.
Pictures on request.
Payment by Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Family and Friends_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s choice of courier, please contact me. UK only. Game is very heavy, but it should be less than £10 for next day.</notes>

Description: This world used to be a garden full of life; from the flying Vadora to the deep-dwelling Dwarves – but that was before Vesh came. The world has been lost and only one city remains; the oldest city in the world – and the last refuge for all of us. Now... we fight back.
The City of Kings is a cooperative tactical roleplaying board game for 1 - 4 players in which your character is tasked with exploring the hazardous world, trading for vital resources, and battling your enemies whilst uncovering a story of a world imperiled.
You start by choosing one of seven stories or twelve scenarios, then select your hero, with each of the six heroes featuring twelve unique skills and nine customizable stats that allow you to specialize in attacking, healing, tanking, worker management, or whatever you desire. Aside from your hero, you need to manage your workers, who must gather resources in order to trade for new items and build structures to gain powerful bonuses.
You explore across the Ageless Realms by turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders and creatures as you continue to power up whilst preparing to enter Azure Rise.
At its heart, The City of Kings is a complex puzzle featuring endless strategic battles. Each creature is generated from a pool of spells, characteristics and stats offering over 10,000,000 unique battle situations. There are no dice, damage is persistent, it’s up to you to customize your characters and work together to come up with a strategy to defeat whoever stands in your way.</notes>

    <notes>This is the first Kickstarter Deluxe edition. The box has some minor wear and one of the Monster Clan markers has a nick in it from punching out, purely cosmetic and does not cover or block any information. This is a heavy box, so expect shipping to be a little higher than normal.</notes>
