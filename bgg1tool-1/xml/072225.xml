   <description>In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG8007)
In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation. If the pollution isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;t stopped, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s game over for all of us! In the game CO?, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy - and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others. In CO?, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs. Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ve built, UN Goals you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ve completed, Company Goals you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ve met, and Expertise you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ve gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s reputation - and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course. This is the highly-anticipated game from Vital Lacerda, designer of last year_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;s hit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Vinhos_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. A great medium-heavy Eurogame with a very topical theme for the 21st century! A game for up to five players... and can be played solo as well! </notes>

Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation. If the pollution isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stopped, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game over for all of us! In the game CO2, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy - and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others. In CO?, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs. Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve built, UN Goals you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve completed, Company Goals you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve met, and Expertise you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reputation - and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course. This is the highly-anticipated game from Vital Lacerda, designer of last year_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Vinhos_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.

    <notes>Stronghold Games (SG8007)
 In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation. If the pollution isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t stopped, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s game over for all of us! In the game CO2, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy - and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others. In CO?, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs. Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve built, UN Goals you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve completed, Company Goals you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve met, and Expertise you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reputation - and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course. This is the highly-anticipated game from Vital Lacerda, designer of last year_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Vinhos_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. A great medium-heavy Eurogame with a very topical theme for the 21st century! A game for up to five players... and can be played solo as well!

    <notes>This is for the FIRST edition. For those that can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wait or don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want to pay the price of the second edition. 
1.  Shipping is from 23113 (Midlothian, VA) and paid by the purchaser. 
2.  Please geekmail me for shipping quote. I am willing to ship through any major carrier (USPS, FedEx, or UPS). Most people prefer USPS as their shipping costs are much more competitive. That being said, please keep in mind the constrained box sizes of priority/regional-boxes  (It may not be possible to package the game super well, which could lead to some box damage in transport). 
3.  Please allow a few days for the games to be shipped. 
4. In general, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m careful about the condition of my games but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts. Furthermore, most played games were sleeved during play... but any sleeves will be remove before shipping. If you have any questions about the condition/edition/etc of a game, please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
5. I reserve the right to cancel purchased based on user’s feedback.</notes>
