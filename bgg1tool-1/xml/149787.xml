   <description>Perdition's Mouth: Abyssal Rift is intended to be a new kind of dungeon crawl, one that embraces the European school of game design with clever and elegant mechanisms and emphasizes strategy while minimizing luck. Cooperation, planning, and the enemy response deck eliminate the need for chucking dice, creating a tense combat environment with meaningful decisions! The rondels provide another tactical layer, including the enemy's devious and challenging AI._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rules allow you to learn to play in 15 minutes, with a typical game round lasting less than ten minutes, even with up to six players, but deep, strategic cooperation will be required for your band of heroes to make it through to the Abyssal Rift and maybe even come out alive._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Perdition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s Mouth is designed to be played as a story-supported campaign over several gaming sessions. In the campaign, you have to fight through at least six increasingly challenging scenarios and the level of success during each adventure has a direct effect on the rest of the story. Can you survive the labyrinth of the insectoid god?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>***NOTE: THIS IS A PRE-ORDER*** Game is expected to arrive from the publisher in Q4, 2016.
This is for the Kickstarter Edition of the game, with all stretch goals included.
The Kickstarter Exclusive Edition is the deluxe version of Perdition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Mouth, available only during the Kickstarter. It will include everything from the Retail Edition, PLUS:
2 standalone scenarios
2 victim miniatures
“Witch’s Grotto” add-on: A timed-exclusive mini-expansion about rescuing (or killing) a witch and claiming a powerful artifact, both of which can be used during the main campaign.
The Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Grotto expansion features:
An extra Hero: Aisha, the Uncanny Shapeshifter, including cards, a miniature, etc.
A new type of enemy: Tharnix, which boosts nearby insectoids
A short standalone campaign of 5 scenarios, one of them designed by Isaac Childres (from Gloomhaven)
1 double-sided extra map board
4 treasure cards, designed by well known game gurus Peter Adkison (Gen Con), Scott Johnson (VtES) and Tristan Hall
(Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game), and illustrated by Matthias Catrein (Dominion).
A wound card also designed by Tristan Hall
Shipping to be determined when the game arrives from the publisher, but expect this game to be on the heavier side - perhaps 8+ pounds (3.6+ kg).
NOTE: I have many add-ons available separately.  Please contact me directly for prices.</notes>

2 standalone scenarios
2 victim miniatures
“Witch’s Grotto” add-on: A timed-exclusive mini-expansion about rescuing (or killing) a witch and claiming a powerful artifact, both of which can be used during the main campaign.
The Witch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Grotto expansion features:
An extra Hero: Aisha, the Uncanny Shapeshifter, including cards, a miniature, etc.
A new type of enemy: Tharnix, which boosts nearby insectoids
A short standalone campaign of 5 scenarios, one of them designed by Isaac Childres (from Gloomhaven)
1 double-sided extra map board
4 treasure cards, designed by well known game gurus Peter Adkison (Gen Con), Scott Johnson (VtES) and Tristan Hall
(Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game), and illustrated by Matthias Catrein (Dominion).
A wound card also designed by Tristan Hall
Shipping to be determined when the game arrives from the publisher, but expect this game to be on the heavier side - perhaps 8+ pounds (3.6+ kg).
NOTE: I have many add-ons available separately.  Please contact me directly for prices.</notes>

One figure was snapped at the ankles upon arrival.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve repaired it and it looks like new.
Otherwise, played a few times in a smoke-free environment.  Components are like-new.  Excellent game!  It fills a niche similar to Gloomhaven (Euro-like dungeon crawler), but with a somewhat more intricate/thinky system, though without the evolving background (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s more like a branching campaign).  There is a ton of gameplay here and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s good solo.</notes>

The shrink on the box has been removed and the Victim in a Cage mini has been assembled, but the game contents are otherwise untouched/unpunched/wrapped. One corner of the box top has mild crushing.

Because of the weight, I will only be able to ship this within the UK...And also because of the weight (7Kg when parcelled up), shipping is £9 fully insured...

    <notes>For user Dennis Sison only!
Retail kickstarter version. In other words its retail with some minor extra stuff added like an extra character. 
There were production issues (I talked to the designer about this) so it may say or look like its a full on kickstarter edition but it isnt despite having the incomplete components for it (ex. it says it has the expansion but it is a misprint)
One flimsy mini has a broken cage because, well, it was flimsy in the first place. It was already that when I opened it.
