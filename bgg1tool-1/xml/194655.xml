    <notes>Santorini is a highly accessible pure strategy game that is simple enough for an elementary school classroom. But with enough gameplay depth and content for even hardcore gamers to explore, Santorini is truly a game for everyone. The rules are deceptively simple.
This is the Kickstarter Edition of Santorini ( Normal Cover ) with all Stretch Goals ( incl.  Golden Fleece Expansion and Soft Cover Story Booklet! ) 
Still in Shrink Wrap !
(Note: In case there is any confusion, this is NOT the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Zeus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Edition, which sold for approximately $250.) 
The game  should arrive in January in Europe. Your game is going to be send out as soon as it arrives at my home.
*** Status update on shipping: Just phoned the EU fullfillment Partner of Roxley: Happyshops - and they told me they still haven´t received all the games at their hub - so i still can give no exact shipping date ***

    <notes>Santorini is a highly accessible pure strategy game that is simple enough for an elementary school classroom. But with enough gameplay depth and content for even hardcore gamers to explore, Santorini is truly a game for everyone. The rules are deceptively simple.
This is the Kickstarter Edition of Santorini ( Normal Cover ) with all Stretch Goals ( incl.  Golden Fleece Expansion and Soft Cover Story Booklet! ) 
Still in Shrink Wrap ! Can ship immediatly ...
(Note: In case there is any confusion, this is NOT the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Zeus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Edition, which sold for approximately $250.)

International Customers, Please ask for our precise shipping costs.
We ship only fully insured. Ordering only a small pocket game or anything very low priced may come out to be very uneconomical. So the minimum order value has to be ~ 50,- EUR! Then the not so low international shipping cost makes sense ;-}
Methods of payment:
-You can always pick the game up at our storage location :-)
-We accept all credit cards !
-You can use PayPal. (That should be the first choice for non-EU customers)
Fuer unsere deutschsprachigen Kunden:
Sie koennen uns fuer alle Fragen gerne telefonisch kontaktieren:
Tel.: 0201-786877
Die Versandkosten innerhalb Deutschlands betragen 6,- EUR (inkl. 19% Mwst.).
Alle Preise enthalten die gesetzliche Mehrwertsteuer in Hoehe von 19%.
Bezahlmoeglichkeiten fuer Kunden innerhalb Deutschlands:
- Alle Kreditkarten willkommen !
- Paypal
- Vorkasse
- Rechnung (Nicht fuer Erstbesteller, wir behalten uns vor die Zahlungsmoeglichkeit per Rechnung von Fall zu Fall neu zu bewerten !)
Alternativ ist natuerlich auch eine Abholung mit Bar-, EC-, oder Kreditkartenzahlung in unserem Lager moeglich. (Im Geschaeft wird neben Brettspielen auch eine ueppige Auswahl an Rollenspielen angeboten.)
Beachten Sie bitte auch unsere Aktionen und weiter Angebote auf: www. fanen.com
