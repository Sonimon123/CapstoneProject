   <description>In Dungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeonlord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the publisher's webpage:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Have you ever ventured with party of heroes to conquer dungeons, gain pride, experiences and of course rich treasure? And has it ever occurred to you how hard it actually is to build and manage such underground complex filled with corridors and creatures? No? Well now you can try. Put yourself in role of the master of underground, summon your servants, dig complex of tunnels and rooms, set traps, hire creatures and try to stop filthy heroes from conquering and plundering your precious creation. We can guarantee you will look on dark corners, lairs and their inhabitant from completely different perspective!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker.  Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc.  Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g. mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are 4 turns to place actions for each game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;year_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and two game years in a whole game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn is identified as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;season_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;.

Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves.  Each hero has their own power for which the player needs to prepare for._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Finally, at the end of each year, the heroes will travel down into the dungeon to fight._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7044)
Have you ever ventured with party of heroes to conquer dungeons, gain pride, experiences and of course rich treasure? And have it ever occurred to you how hard it actually is to build and manage such underground complex filled with corridors and creatures? No? Well now you can try. Put yourself in role of the master of underground, summon your servants, dig complex of tunnels and rooms, set traps, hire creatures and try to stop filthy heroes from conquering and plundering your precious creation. We can guarantee you will look on dark corners, lairs and their inhabitant from completely different perspective!
Dungeon Lords is 90 minute long game for 2 to 4 players. It’s a rather complex game enjoyable mostly for experienced gamers.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7044)
They meet in a tavern. They quaff a few ales. Before the night is over, the strong warrior, the wily wizard, the committed priest and the sneaky thief form an inseparable party of adventurers, ready to rid the world of evil. And wouldn’t you know it? There just happens to be some evil within easy walking distance. A dark lord has filled a nearby hill with tunnels, traps, treasure, and trolls. And so the next morning (or the next afternoon if too many ales were quaffed) the heroes set out to fight for Right, conquer the dungeon, and punish the wicked lord (by taking all his treasure, of course). It’s a classic scenario, and any veteran dungeon crawler will tell you that’s the way things ought to be.
But what about that dark lord? Does anyone ever think about his feelings? Those adventurers, who have never done an honest day’s work in their lives, can not begin to imagine how much effort goes into building a respectable dungeon. They have no idea how hard it is to tunnel through granite, how expensive good traps are these days, how difficult it is to find qualified imps, or how
much food it takes to feed a troll. And the bureaucracy! Dungeons must meet rigid safety specifi cations, gold mining is subject to strict regulations, and taxes are due whenever the Ministry of Dungeons feels like it. And as soon as the dungeon is built, some band of do-gooders comes along and hacks everything up. Life is not easy for a dungeon lord.

    <notes>Z-Man Games (ZMG 7044)
They meet in a tavern. They quaff a few ales. Before the night is over, the strong warrior, the wily wizard, the committed priest and the sneaky thief form an inseparable party of adventurers, ready to rid the world of evil. And wouldn’t you know it? There just happens to be some evil within easy walking distance. A dark lord has filled a nearby hill with tunnels, traps, treasure, and trolls. And so the next morning (or the next afternoon if too many ales were quaffed) the heroes set out to fight for Right, conquer the dungeon, and punish the wicked lord (by taking all his treasure, of course). It’s a classic scenario, and any veteran dungeon crawler will tell you that’s the way things ought to be.
But what about that dark lord? Does anyone ever think about his feelings? Those adventurers, who have never done an honest day’s work in their lives, can not begin to imagine how much effort goes into building a respectable dungeon. They have no idea how hard it is to tunnel through granite, how expensive good traps are these days, how difficult it is to find qualified imps, or how much food it takes to feed a troll. And the bureaucracy! Dungeons must meet rigid safety specifi cations, gold mining is subject to strict regulations, and taxes are due whenever the Ministry of Dungeons feels like it. And as soon as the dungeon is built, some band of do-gooders comes along and hacks everything up. Life is not easy for a dungeon lord.</notes>

Standard Information listed on all my For Sale Games:
------------------------------------------------------
1) Shipping cost is the highest cost of all games purchased + the add on cost of each other game. Promo cards or anything else that fits in a bubble mailer will have a base cost of $5 and and an add on cost of $1, a small game has a base cost of $8 and an add on cost of $2, a medium game has a base cost of $14 and an add on cost of $3 and a large game has a base cost of $20 and add on cost of $4. Anything outside that range will be listed specifically. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re providing a business address to ship to, take a $1 off the shipping. 
2) Purchase a $100 or more worth of games and get 5% off your total order.
3) Purchase $200 or more and get 5% off and free shipping.
4) If you see any games on my for trade list that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t up for sale, feel free to ask me to add to the market.
5) Most conditions are listed as very good, all those items listed as such range from very good to like new. 
6) Amazon and game store gift cards are usually accepted but please check with me first if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an option you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pursue.
7) I try to list editions but if an edition isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t listed and it matters to you, please ask! If an item is bought and another edition was expected but you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask, then I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to refund but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t cover either shipping charge.</notes>

    <notes>This was received in trade, and I was unhappy with the condition it was in (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s NOT in bad shape, but it has obviously been played -- it was misrepresented to me in the trade). 
This is why the price is inexpensive compared to other listings. With that said, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s NOT really that bad... but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not up to my standards or to the standards of many with whom I trade here on BGG.</notes>

    <notes>Received as like-new in a math trade, solo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d it once, but never got it to the table again :(.  Components in perfect shape, bagged, and essentially no box wear either.
Buyer to pay exact shipping costs +$0.50 for materials, even internationally.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>This offer includes the base game, the Festival Season expansion, and the following stretch goals from the Happy Anniversary kickstarter (note that the game itself is the original 2009 edition): wooden adventurer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s marker, 2 sided cardboard scoring sheet, wooden courage tokens for the bard and larger food tokens, glass cubes, bonus trap, event, and spell cards, troll tokens, additional progress board with festival season on one side and all variants on the other, bonus pet cards, hand drawn comic book (short, just a few pages), minions bearing gifts rulebook, dungeon set-up mini expansion, gold coins, and food stickers.  All of this is currently housed in the base game original box, but I still do have the festival season box if desired.  The base game box does have some shelf wear and the rulebooks have obviously been read and referenced multiple times.  One festival season dungeon board extension is slightly frayed (but still in tact and useable).  All other contents are in excellent condition and the game has been confirmed complete.  Free shipping when you buy any three games from me.</notes>

    <notes>This item includes the Base Game, Festival Season and the Happy Anniversary Upgrades from the Kickstarter campaign for the complete Dungeon Lords Experience - all contained in the Dungeon Lords base game box.
This item includes the expansion pack shown here (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/162529/dungeon-...), 30 metal coins, food stickers, dungeon setup cards, rulebook for the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Dungeon Setup_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Minions Bearing Gifts_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mini-expansions) and all unlocked stretch goals marked with a smile. See Kickstarter Page for all the details (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/532062403/dungeon-lords...). Geekmail with any questions about included components.
The box cover has a good bit of edge/shelf wear but is structurally sound.
The core game rulebook has some wear and wrinkles, but is intact and perfectly usable.
The game components are in great shape. All cards were sleeved during use - they have been removed for the purpose of selling.
The Minion meeples have homemade stickers affixed to them, but I have also included the official Minion stickers as well if you want to change them.
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t miss out on this great deal! B-)</notes>

    <notes>My collection is taking up too much room in my tiny Boston apartment, unfortunately. Selling games that don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see much play.
All pieces present, played twice.  Box insert is in rough shape, box corners have a little wear, almost no wear to actual components.
Buyer pays shipping from Boston, MA (or pickup can be arranged).</notes>

    <notes>This item is posted as a part of the WargameHQ Shelf Clearing Auction.
The item listed is only for purchase by:
lucegoose100
The price has been set at the winning bid, or Buy It Now, price posted to the auction item comment page.
If you won multiple items, please be sure to add them all to your cart at once and then check out so I can include them in your shipping estimate.
As a reminder:
I will only ship to the addresses within the United States.
I only accept PayPal and payment details will be sent alongside your final invoice.
Your item(s) will ship on the Saturday FOLLOWING verified payment. 
I will provide tracking information for your item and insurance sufficient to cover the final price of the auction on shipped items.
Please inspect your items within the first 5 business days of receipt, beyond that I cannot assist with disputes. I also make no guarantees implied or otherwise as to the condition of games if the carrier has been rough with shipping. I pack games in peanuts and try to ensure both the games and their contents are secured inside the boxes to minimize issues.
If you fail to pay for your item within 5 business days, I will cancel the sale and list the item on eBay and you can re-bid on it there at that time.
If you have any special requests, please Geekmail me so we can discuss prior to payment finalization.
Thank you for your purchase and I hope you enjoy your new game(s)!</notes>
