   <description>Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;connection-type_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Connection type_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Price includes shipping!
Incredibly well-preserved original bookshelf game (copyright 1962) that includes Double TwixT rules for 4 players. Only v. minor evidence of any wear: 
Small amt of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;sticky_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; left from original pricetag. Some tape present and some carefully removed along edges where tape was used to keep contents from falling out. 
Spine that will face out from your bookshelf shelf looks new.
The rules sleeve, pieces, and board are in mint condition. I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t counted pieces, but it looks like all or nearly all must be here. There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s even like-new booklet of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fun _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Games_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from 3M enclosed, circa _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;62 of course.
Will send or upload image(s) if requested by serious buyer.</notes>

    <notes>Twixt, 1962, vintage 3M Bookshelf game for two players, rules for 4 in teams.
Contents are clean _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; undamaged.50 each of red _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; black barriers, 49 red pegs, 51 black pegs.  No listing of what the contents should be, however I believe this game to be complete as we received it.  We only played it a few times.  The box is clean with no splits, but as you can see in the picture, the top edge is badly gouged. The box spine shows only some shelf wear for a game of this age.

    <notes>       Twixt - The Strategy Game of Barriers
Twixt is an 2 person (or two teams of 2 players) abstract strategy game which is played on board with a 24×24 grid of holes, with the four corners missing.   The object of the game is to build an uninterrupted _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bridge_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; from one end of the board to the other. The players do this by alternately placing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pegs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on the board, which can be placed in a way that they can connect with up to 8 other pegs. If a player has placed a peg in such a position that it can be connected to another peg, they can place a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;link_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; connecting the pegs. The restriction is that links cannot cross each other, so a player can place pegs and links in such a manner that they block their opponents links. The first player to created an uninterrupted path from one side of the board to the other is the winner.  One tricky aspect to placing pegs and links is that the links will not connect if the pegs are placed in line with each other.   
While the game is simple in concept and the basic play is easily learned, it offers a plethora of situations that require skill as opposed to luck and therefore remains challenging for a long time to come. The whole outcome of the game can turn on a single move, and so requires thinking several turns ahead in order to succeed. If you narrow your focus too much you will almost certainly find yourself outflanked by your opponent. Originally an old pen and paper game, this board game version of Twixt adds a visually interesting 3D aspect.   
This game is in excellent, like new condition- it does not look like it was ever played.  The lighter areas at the top of the pictures is just light bouncing off of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;leather look_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  box-there is no damage to either the box or pieces.  This is one of the 3-M Bookshelf Series (published between 1962 to 1974) and which, when placed on a shelf, resembles leather bound books-they really are kind of neat looking and offer an interesting and attractive storage solution.  Please Email me with any questions. .

Box: Light to moderate shelf-wear with a few dings, wrinkles and paper tears. Overall the box is in very good condition!
Contents: Complete and in like new condition! The plastic container has been removed (it was way too small to hold all the pieces) and the pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags - you will be very pleased with how the game is packaged!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

Box has moderate shelf wear, expected for a game of this age.
Components are complete and in excellent condition.  Plastic boards are clean, with 4 board clips.  At least 50 of both color pegs and links.</notes>

Bought used. The game page on BGG says there should be about 50 each of the 4 different pieces, and there are between 49 and 51 of each. Noticeable age on the box, but overall in good condition. 3M English black bookcase edition (1962) - I think.
