   <description>The components of Bazaar include a whole bunch of little chips, in five colors. At the start of the game, two equation cards are randomly chosen. Each equation card has five equations on it, for a total of ten equations that will be in effect for the duration of the game. The equations state equivalences between certain combinations of colors, for example:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Red = Green Green_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Green Yellow = Blue Blue Red_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Four target cards are turned up, each with some combination of five chips represented on the target card (so a typical target card might be Green Green Blue Blue Blue)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;On your turn, you roll a colored die to randomly pick a colored chip for yourself, or you can make one exchange of your colored chips based on the equations. The goal is to end up with the right combination of chips to get one of the target cards. You want to do this quickly _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and even more importantly, with as few chips left over as possible after you've purchased the target card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; because this is how you score points._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>BAZAAR 1987 Discovery Toys.  I assume complete with instruction sheet, 10 barter cards, 45 merchandise cards, 4 star cards, 100 jewels (20 ea. clear, blue, red, yellow, green), 1 special wood die, 1 scoresheet pad.  The bag of jewels is still in its unopened plastic bag and the cards are still cellophane sealed.  All components are Brand New condition.  Box has wear including creases and marks, but has kept the contents in perfect shape.  Shipping weight is 3 pounds.</notes>

    <notes>Discovery Toys edition. Cards still in their shrinkwrap, (although the shrink is torn off at one end). Box shows a small patch of tape/price tag tear on one side panel, and the same corner is starting to have the cover paper come off. Very minor in my opinion. This is the version with the glass beads.
Pictures available upon request.</notes>

    <notes>Discovery Games (non-special) edition.  Game is complete, with little sign of shelfwear to the components or the box, but a previous owner had taped the box shut.  Someone else cut the tape to open the box, but the tape remains, and I have not tried to remove it.

    <notes>100% Complete. This is the Discovery Toys Special Edition of a family favorite. The merchandise and barter cards and the gems are all like new but the box has some shelf wear. I store my games in a pet-free and smoke-free environment and I package my games for shipment with the utmost care. I ship quickly, within 24 hours of receiving payment. Shipping weight is 4 pounds.

    <notes>Bazaar Special Edition (1994) from Discovery Toys
Box: Light shelf-wear and a few minor dings, dents and wrinkles. One corner of the top is split and there is some small, neat writing on the front (only covers an area about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;). Overall the box is in excellent condition!
Contents: Complete and in new condition! The pieces and cards are sealed in their original packaging!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International bidders are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling a Discovery Toys _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Special Edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; copy of Bazaar. It has been played a few times, but everything inside the box is in near mint condition. The outside of the box shows minor wear with the worst feature being a permanent marker mark on the front (I think everyone knows what that is from!) that is faded by me attempting to remove it using a dry erase marker. Anyway, we have enjoyed the plays we have had of Bazaar, but need to slim the collection down a bit.
Comes from a smoke free/pet free environment.
It looks just a bit less worn than this picture: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/54309 but gives you an idea of what my copy looks like.
Shipping to anywhere in the U.S. is $14. The glass stones make this one a little heavy!
Thanks for looking!

    <notes>Some glass beads are missing, but these are very easily replaced to someone who knows his or her way around a craft store (not me).
I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Bazaar Special Edition (1994) by Discovery Toys
Box:  Moderate shelfwear with several significant dings, dents, and creases.  In particular, the box bottom has two areas where the paper has been peeled or worn off:  one area is about 1 x 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and the other is about 1/2 x 1 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Box top also has one split corner.  Overall the box is in good condition.
Components:  Complete and in good condition!  All of the barter cards (the big square cards) have minor creases along the edges, but this will not affect gameplay at all.  Two of the merchandise cards have minor creases, but these are difficult to see on the back and therefore should not affect gameplay.  The pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.  
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

There is obvious wear and light dirt on box.  There is a ~1 cm^2 tear in the paper to the upper right of the box top.  Cards, boards, and rulebook are in very good condition.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

Everything else is in great shape.  This is the Discovery Kids printing of the game.  There are no split corners and all pieces seem to be here. The bag the jewels are in may have been replaced as it seems to be a normal ziploc bag. All the cards are in great shape.  There is an unobtrusive price sticker on the front of the box near the bottom right corner.</notes>

Box: Moderate shelfwear with multiple significant dings, dents, and wrinkles. Box top also has two split corners.  Overall the box is in fair condition.
Components: Four Paulaner tokens are replacements (color copy on cardstock) and one Becks token is creased, but this will not affect game play in the least.  Remaining components are complete and in excellent condition!  Pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.

    <notes>Gryphon Games (GRY 101308N)
Through skillful trading and re-trading, each player attempts to gain the right combination of colored stones from the Bank to purchase the wares displayed in the Bazaar. Values of the various wares are determined by the number of stones the purchaser holds following his transaction. Trading is governed by the current rates posted at the Exchange. When all the wares from two of the stalls have been sold, the Bazaar is closed, the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins!</notes>

    <notes>Discovery Toys (non-special edition). Still in original shrink.  The only negative (and why I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t list it as New) is that there is a slight, very shallow cut along the bottom of the box.  The shrink also split along this cut.</notes>

The box has some wear, small torn swatches, and stains on the inside, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s intact. The components are in very good condition.</notes>

    <notes>Discovery Toys Special Edition.  The box shows lots of wear.  Some of the corners of the box are split but it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect the structural integrity of the box.  The game has been played quite a few times so the cards show some light wear.  Some of the jewels are missing: 3 white, 1 blue and 2 green (there are supposed to be 20 gems of each color).  These type of jewels are sold in many game stores so I believe they could be easily replaced.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling what appears to be an unplayed copy of Bazaar Special Edition by Discovery Toys.  All of the glass beads and die are accounted for and are perfect with the cards and boards in unplayed condition.  The box has one clean torn corner and a bit of wear on the edges, but for the age of the game and the condition of the game inside this is in excellent condition overall.
The game being sold is this one:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/910261/bazaar
Comes from a smoke/pet free environment.
Shipping:  $10

    <notes>BierBorse edition. This 1979 German edition of Sid Sackson_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Bazaar is themed around beer. The tokens are plastic but look like beer bottlecaps, and the cards in the game look like beer coasters and have about that thickness. I acquired the game used and it has normal shelfwear for its age. Printout of English rules included.
A couple pictures of my version are at
http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1793822/jamest
http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1793821/jamest
Minimum bid: $50
Does not fit in a flat-rate box, but I priced the cost of using Standard Post on USPS.com (2 lbs, 10z, box 19.5 x 14.5 x 3.5), and it ranged from ~$7 to a little under $13 for the zips I checked.  </notes>

    <notes>1987 Discovery Games edition.  All 100 glass beads are accounted for.  Rest of game is in excellent condition.  The only _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;flaw_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is that it was sealed with some sort of paper tape then left in a shed in the Arizona summer heat so the tape crumbled when touched; but there are some yellowish glue stains on the all white box bottom.  I just thought that you should know everything about the game.</notes>

    <notes>Version - Gryphon Games
Condition - Played twice, in excellent condition with minor box wear.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
