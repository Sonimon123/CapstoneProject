   <description>Over a thousand years ago, Valandor, the greatest known hero fell in battle, fighting to protect the lives of those around him. From shore to shore, all owe thanks to his wondrous legacy. Now, sacred sites across the land have been defiled and plundered by the disgraced wizard Mortibris, who along with his vile undead minions will stop at nothing to obtain the secrets of Valandor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s power. Only the bravest heroes dare oppose him. Thrown together from the far corners of the realm, they step boldly into the depths, ready to face whatever foul evil awaits them_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hero, your quest begins here!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Embark on a fantasy adventure for up to five players with Dungeon Saga: Dwarf King's Quest. With highly detailed game-pieces and learn-as-you-play rules, this set contains everything you need to transform your tabletop into a deep and immersive world of heroes and monsters. Play a single game in just 30 minutes, or combine the carefully composed adventures for countless hours of classic quest gameplay. When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, which part will you play in the epic Dungeon Saga?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;nbsp;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-Epic, story-driven campaign_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-Classic quest atmosphere_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-Easy rules you can learn as you play_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-Characters that develop as the adventure unfolds_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-Beautifully illustrated 3D dungeons with doors, barrels, bookcases and more!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-26 detailed and fully assembled miniatures in coloured plastic_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;-Evocative _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;lsquo;ancient tome_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; packaging in a protective sleeve_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One player takes the part of the evil dungeon overlord with the forces of evil at his command, and the others divide the mighty heroes between them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;nbsp;Each hero has strengths and weaknesses and teamwork is the key: The mighty barbarian can slaughter many foes at a time, yet he is lightly armoured and vulnerable to strong enemies. The Dwarf, on the other hand, is steadier as his thick armour can resist most attacks. The Elf is not as skilled a fighter as either of these, instead preferring to stay at a distance where her finely-honed archery skills can best be used. Finally, there is the wizard -the others may laugh at his lack of fighting skill, yet it is often his magic that carries the day. If the others can keep him alive, that is._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This core set will be supported with a raft of expansion products as time goes on, adding new challenges and game modes to your Dungeon Saga.

The Warlord of Galahir

See Kickstarter Update #69 -  href=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/dungeon-saga-the-dwarf-kings-quest/posts/1185891_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rel=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nofollow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/dungeon-saga..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;/a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;
The base Dungeon Master pledge includes too much to list everything here, but the following KS Exclusives are included:

Keldan - resin mini

I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know what the final shipping weight of this lot will be, but I estimate it will be at least 10 pounds - and likely more.  I take great care with the items I ship, but because of the size and value of this listing, I am requiring the buyer to pay for insurance during shipping.  Please consider this when deciding whether to buy this lot.
Please contact me if you have any questions.  I want the buyer to know exactly what is included in case anything is unclear, and be 100% comfortable with purchasing this lot.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a Kickstarter edition of Dungeon Saga. Core gameplay is good but I purchased it for the solo rules which I found lacking compared to other games I already owned. The game and expansions have been opened and played a few times. Tiles are punched and everything has been sorted and bagged. In order to fit everything in the boxes, I have mixed card decks and tiles together. Anyone looking to keep everything separate when storing will have some sorting to do. But, everything is accounted for and all bent miniatures have been straightened.
This lot includes:
Dungeon Saga: Dwarf King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Quest
Warlord of Galahir expansion
Infernal Crypts expansion
Tyrant of Halpi expansion
Hardcover Adventurers Companion (book has page reference typos and is being reprinted by Mantic) and card decks
Black Fortress tiles and furniture set
Kickstarter exclusive heroes and dungeon journal
If interested I will include epic versions of 8 of the dungeon saga heroes (wizard, barbarian, ranger, dwarf, paladin, cleric, thief and salamander). Be warned, they are resin miniatures and I have assembled them already. They are very fragile and at risk of breaking when shipped. I will send them them if buyer is interested, but wanted to provide fair warning and have not included them in my overall valuation of the lot.
Buyer will pay actual shipping costs. Expect a heavy package (approx. 15 lbs.).</notes>

    <notes>And another KS, I have acquired but not played. Maybe the game will find a new owner here.
This is the KS version = Dungeon Master level - 1 copy of the game and a ton of stretch goals are included, too. See jpg. As with my other sale here (Mercs Recon), there really are a lot of additional miniatures.
Cards still in shrink wrap. 
Please note: some digital rewards are still in the making. Of course, I will pass on all related emails / files as soon as they become available!
If you would like to see any additional pictures, just send me a geekmail and I will happily provide them.
And if you have any questions, please ask!
Please note: Shipping ONLY to EU and with tracking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; insurance!
Shipping costs:
to Germany - 6 Euro - includes tracking and insurance
to EU - 16 Euro - includes tracking and insurance - unfortunately, the two games + stretch goals add up to a bit more than 5 kilogramms :-(
Payment method A (preferred): via transfer to my EU bank account via IBAN/BIC in advance
Payment method B: via PayPal. Please note that if you choose this option, I will split the PayPal fee. In this case, 3,2 Euro/2 -_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; 1,6 Euro.
So the total price will be 141,6 Euro + shipping.</notes>

This is the Dungeon Saga: Dungeon Master pledge with all the extras that come with it AND all the add-on GAMEPLAY expansions.  (None of the add-on resins)
Dungeon Saga Base
All Dungeon Saga DM extras listed in the Kickstarter
*The following expansions were ordered as add-ons from the Kickstarter and do not come with retail packaging*
Warlord expansion
Infernal expansion
Tyrant expansion
Black Fortress expansion
Hard Back version of the Adventurers Companion (Origional with printing errors.  I went through and handwrote in the missing page numbers.)
14 Mantic Points you can mail in to get the exclusive Necromancer Figure
*Note: one of the monster figures is missing a base and one of the extra trolls is missing an arm.  I call him _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Stubby._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  (Delivered that way, unfortunately).  On the plus side, there are so many extra monsters you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d never need to use Stubby or No Base anyway.
All this sells for over $350 at discout retailer, Miniature Market.  Just saying :)</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Dungeon Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge from the kickstarter, including the base game plus all stretch goals. It also includes the following expansions:
* Corrected printing of the Adventurers Companion (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/195004/dungeon-saga-adventurers-companion)
* Infernal Crypts (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/197263/dungeon-saga-infernal-crypts)
* Warlord of Galahir (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/204989/dungeon-saga-warlord-galahir)
* Tyrant of Helpi (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/206046/dungeon-saga-tyrant-halpi)
* Return of Valandor (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/205984/dungeon-saga-return-valandor)
* Black Fortress dungeon tiles and furniture pack
The base game has been punched and is complete but the rest are still packaged as they came (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve checked that I have the right number of packs of miniatures and cards, but not opened them). It includes a second book box to store the expansions.  The miniatures appear to be fine, but will require some hot water treatment.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to arrange a local pick up in Canberra, or please contact me for a postage quote. Payment by direct deposit preferred.</notes>

KS-Version; plus:
- Warlord of Galahir
- Infernal Crypts
- Tyrant of Halpi
- Black Fortress
- Dungeon Traps
- Acrylic Counter Upgrade
Note: The pictures over at the KS page are NOT what Mantic decided to finally produce / deliver nor are all of the promised goals produced. I will send everything electronically to you given you provide a valid e-mail-address or Dropbox - account IF IT EVER BECOMES AVAILABLE !!!!! (Adventures, Scenarios aso). If not that be so and is not my responsibility.
The game is unplayed but inspected and punched. The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Companion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is as delivered, no replacements were made. As far as I could see (there are various lists (sadly not always agreeing with one-another) about what should have been in the box, the one from Mantic I base my inspection on is sadly very _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;short_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) the game is complete, all minis are be there. One resin (?) mini (a stretch goal) has no base (no replacement was made) but this should be easy to fix in using bases from Tabletop gaming.
IMPORTANT: This package is huge and will be sold in the original KS-Pack. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to cover the minis better than I received them. Nevertheless some minis are bend and have to be fixed (hot water - see BGG for tips on how to do it). So shipping is expensive: Expect between 17 to 22 € in the main-EU, extra for the outskirts or islands; oversea (US, Asia etc.) will be at least 4 times that. Shipping will be checked at the local postal-office when sale is confirmed and you only pay what I have to pay for shipping.
Shipping only with DHL (German Post), insured up to 500 €. If the package gets lost I will refund you as soon as I get the money from DHL except shipping costs (they are not refunding these, dunno why).
One obvious note: Please make sure you give me the correct shipping address (yes, it seems to happen that people don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know where they live) - packages returned to me will have extra fees and will be send again ONLY if you pay these fees AND the additional shipping costs. 
Payment: bank-transfer (Europe only)
or PayPal (+ 3 % fees in addition / 5 % + (depending on country) for oversea / non-EU)
By buying you agree that you have read all of the points made above and accepted the terms of this sale.</notes>
