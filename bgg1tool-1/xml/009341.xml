   <description>_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Gold, Gold, Gold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; A Ton of Gold_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; this was the Seattle headline heard round the world announcing the discovery of great stores of gold in the Klondike. This was the beginning of an exodus of would-be prospectors dreaming of a better life; a chance to escape the toil caused by the financial recessions and bank failures of the 1890s. Gold Rush Hysteria was pulsing through the veins of the country and tens of thousands were willing to risk it all for the chance to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;have it all_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Lost Valley is a game about the Klondike stampede that rushed North. It's about the grueling journey: traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads, through severe weather, and ever-dwindling resources._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During the course of the game, players must explore the ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As you set out from the outfitters with everything you own strapped to your back, you must balance carefully the resources that you need. Of course you will need tools, dynamite and timber to extract mountain gold, but you'll need to make sure you have room for food, rifles and fishing poles to help you survive in the wilderness._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Grab your horse, your pack, and your whiskey because _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;The Gold Fever is Raging_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in the Yukon. Hordes will go, many will turn back or die, but some will achieve their wildest dreams._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Reimplemented by:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Lost Valley (second edition)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Multiple copies available.
$40 + $11 shipping.
Or a sealed but slightly damaged box for $34 + $11 shipping.  (One bottom corner is pushed in 0.5 centimeters, enough to cause a 1-centimeter crack in the printed paper on the cardboard.) 
I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
Optional insurance $1.35.

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>Unplayed, complete and in perfect shape. An FAQ and several player aides printed out on card stock are included in the box. Smoke free household.
Combined shipping available on multiple purchases so check out my other items for sale.
I ship via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation were possible. The other option I use for larger games is FedEx. I only charge you what it costs me to ship the game and I will try to ship without flat rate shipping where weight and distance would result in a lower price. For international shipping there may be some restrictions on where I will ship to. Please contact me before purchasing if you are an international buyer. </notes>

Unplayed but punched.  [Correction: it has now been played once.]
The tokens, board pieces, player pawns, and insert are all in excellent condition.  The rulebook and player aids are in very good condition (clean, but with enough subtle bending that you can tell they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been read).  The box top has an outward bow.  The box bottom has light wear near the corners.
The shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. Lost Valley does fit in a flat rate box, so that should be at most $10.50 in you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the US. I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>Nearly new condition. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve also printed out in full colour, and laminated, extra (4x) English versions of the character boards and prices sheets (the ones in the Files section of the listing on BGG) as you only get one set of English ones in the original. Comes with all the original parts and boards. Shipping will be as cheap as I can find for your location - for UK this will only be about £3.</notes>
