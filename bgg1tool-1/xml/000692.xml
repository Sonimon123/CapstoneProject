    <notes>This is the basic set of WK, including 4 maps and the Orc and Elf armies. It has been played once. All stickers are stuck on the blocks. The manual is a black _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; white photocopy (it came from Columbia like this!), but Iâ€™ll also include a full-color printout (3-hole punched) of the PDF manual available on Columbiaâ€™s website. Additionally, Iâ€™m including printouts of all the scenarios available from Columbiaâ€™s site, as well as some from a WK fan site from the internet. This game is in prime condition and ready to play right out of the box (you wonâ€™t have to spend an hour putting the stickers on â€“ Iâ€™ve done it for you!). $40 includes shipping to the continental US; contact me and we can discuss shipping costs to other locations.</notes>

    <notes>This is for a complete set of Wizard Kings.  This includes all seven army races (Elfs, Orcs, Undead, Barbarians, Amazons, Dwarfs and Warthogs), and all 12 maps.  Bought new this would cost approximately $125.00.
For free I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including both Chaos armies (Chaos and Were-beasts). I am not charging for these because I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve modified them so that any army can recruit any chaos unit, rather than having to assign the chaos units to specific armies.
All the stickers have been applied and all the contents are in excellent condition.  The cover for the main box has some minor taped damage.
I will charge exact shipping via USPS priority plus insurance and delivery confirmation unless requested otherwise.
Feel free to ask me any questions.</notes>

    <notes>I am selling EVERYTHING from 1st edition Wizard Kings:
1. Wizard Kings base game (Elves, Orc armies, maps 1-4,rules)
2. All the extra maps (for a grand total of 12 with the base maps)
3. ALL army expansions: Dwarves, Ferkin, Amazon, Barbarian, Undead, Chaos, Werebeasts (the base game already includes Orcs, and Elves).  
4. Laminated player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s guide:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/13934
5. Laminated player aid cards (spell cards)
This is my set with all the units lined up inside.
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/81195 (dice shown are not included)
The game, units, and maps are all in EXCELLENT condition.  In the past ~3yrs or so that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve owned the game, it has barely been played.  The outside cover sleeve has minimal wear.  Rules included are version 1.6 (you can get the latest online).  
Shipping:  USPS Priority Mail $9.50
Feel free to ask me any questions.  Thanks for looking!

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never played a game on this and I bought it new, so it is in like new condition,  except the original manual is missing (a printed out one is included). Stickers have been carefully applied to the blocks for everything, except for the non-race specific items in the expansion pack, so you can still decided how those should go on.

- All 1st edition expansion maps: 1-4 with base game, 5-8 and 9-12 as expansion packs, 13-16 with 2nd ed.
- 4 12mm dice in each army color [close as I could get: orange is a little dark, ferkins get ivory because brown dice are impossible to come by]; Chessex, if I recall
- Comb-bound printout of scenario booklet from Columbia [one of the older editions of it], as well as 1.5 edition rules [in 1st ed. box] and 2.0 edition [in 2nd ed. box]
All very lightly played [except unplayed 2nd ed. base]. All cases and boxes included. Printed out custom-made terrain guides [2.0 rules for confusing stacking / side limits]. 
Get this, try out the old version as it was meant to be, try out the new version before buying into the booster packs, try out a bunch of scenarios to find one you like.
$195 + I cover first $5 shipping [your part is likely to be ~$10]

    <notes>Notes: This game is complete. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got all 4 maps, the Elves and Orcs armies (28 blocks each for a total of 56 armies), 5 dice (4 blue and 1 white), rules, and an extra copied set of the rules. Not sure how many dice are supposed to come with this, the white die might be a replacement. 
The box, blocks and rulebook show light-moderate wear. The corner of one of the pages of the rulebook has a 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tear, but has been taped. Good player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, or for someone who wants another couple of armies. 
$12.50 for USPS priority. If you send your zip, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll check on what parcel post shipping will be.

    <notes>RESERVED FOR motorona74. ALL OTHER PURCHASES WILL BE REJECTED.
This is my Wizard Kings first edition Wizard Kings. It is fully expanded with all 9 armies (two in the base game plus all seven expansion sets) and all twelve maps (four in the base game plus all eight expansion maps numbered 5 to 12).
The game also contains laminated player aids, two additional sets of rules, a scenarios book, seven spare blocks plus laminated copies of the chaos and werebeast units (the original stickers are unused) to enable a more flexible approach to mercenary army creation.
The slip case box shows a little shelf wear commensurate with a game of this age.
With the high numbers of blocks included this game is heavy, so expect UK courier services to cost 7 GBP including signed for and insurance.
I also have two sets of Victory blocks, red and blue standard sets. Remind me and I will include these free. I am pretty sure that you will be able to concoct some reasonable scenarios using the WK maps. Rules available on the Columbia Games site.</notes>

Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a large to very large size game (lot includes several expansion pack cases).
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
