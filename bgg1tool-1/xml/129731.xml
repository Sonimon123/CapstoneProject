    <notes>This was the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;striker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; level of the game from the kickstarter at : http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/dreadball-the-futuristic-sports-game
The box was opened but the game was never played at all.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve received all the add-ons that came to this level but I did not purchase any of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;extras_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  You can see that I paid $150 for it on the kickstarter and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ever play it, so I would like to sell it for $100.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include the PDF_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s of the season 2 and season 3 books that came with it.</notes>

Blaine, Season 4 (DBX) MVP
This copy has been played a couple of times upon release but after the initial burst of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;new game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; excitement I found I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the time or energy to make weekly League events or tournaments.  Many of the miniatures remain un-handled still in their sealed bags. 
Please ask me any questions if you need to know any specific details, but I will try and add photos here in time.

    <notes>2012 Mantic Games. The game has been opened but unplayed.  The box bottom suffered moderate to heavy creasing, but everything inside the box is unopened and like new.
This lot will include five additional teams (four in good condition, one incomplete).</notes>

    <notes>THIS LISTING IS RESERVED FOR RidiQles.  DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS THAT IS YOUR USERNAME.
Not the game itself, but the following miniatures for the game:
Female Corporation
7 Figures: 1 Guard, 2 Jacks, 3 Strikers, 1 Prone
-----One Striker is broken at the ankle, but appears repairable with a dab of glue.
Z_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;zor
8 Figures: 2 Guards, 2 Jacks, 3 Strikers, 1 Prone
Asterians
2 Figures: 1 Striker, 1 Guard
Teratons
2 Figures: 1 Guard, 1 Jack
Nameless
4 Figures: 3 Strikers, 1 Sticky Guard
-----One Striker is metal.
-----Both plastic Strikers have a broken tail.
(I re-glued one plastic Striker_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tail and it shouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t show at all after painting. I have the broken tail for the second, but it may require a small amount of green stuff modeling putty to repair.)
All of these are unplayed/unassembled. Clear plastic bases are included for all but the prone figures.
Shipping is $5 to Southern California.</notes>

    <notes>I still have my kickstarter version of dreadball. It has never been used and all the miniatures are unopened in their original packaging. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not looking to turn a profit, just hoping to make someone happy with the purchase (pledge was Striker for a total backed of 215).
Includes the base game and all the stretch goals. As it is quite a lot of material to sort through (with no knowledge of what is what) and a long time ago i am not 100% clear on the extras added, but looking at the page and a quick glance it would seem to be:
2 extra teams
cheerleaders
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to make pictures, throw me a pm if interested.</notes>
