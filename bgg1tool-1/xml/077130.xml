    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG CI01)
Designed by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people’s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.
In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!</notes>

The box has one minor dent, it has no effect on components.  
Components-wise: everything is in like new shape.  Most of the cards have not even been touched by human hands!

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG CI01)
Designed by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people’s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.
In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!</notes>

    <notes>Comments 
I said _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, which it is, having been played twice. But somebody walked off with the rule book. However, this should not trouble you. I had a full colour copy made on thick art paper. The result is better than the original.
It is an excellent game but since our group travels one hour each way to get to my place it lasts just too long to finish a game. So I might as well sell it.
For postage purposes the game packed in a protective outer carton will weigh just under 2 kilos (£4.41 by current UK parcel post)
Sorry - no offers

    <notes>Item Name: Civilization The Board Game
Description: Civilization The Board Game from Fantasy Flight used/complete.
Shipping Weight: 6 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Shrink wrap undone but never even read the rules.  Perfect condition.  I have too many other Civ games so I will let this one go to free up shelf space. 
Shipping will be based on actual shipping cost, I would guess around $12.  Check my other sales to find other items to potentially ship together and save.

    <notes>Complete and in great condition.
Price is low because buyer pays for shipping, and shipping has become more expensive lately. 
Please feel free to combine purchases from me to reduce the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;per pound_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; shipping cost. I am trying to significantly reduce my game collection and am willing to sell almost all my games on my list, even those that I have not gotten around to listing for sale yet.
Thank you</notes>

    <notes>Description:
Designed by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people’s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.
In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!
Game Components:
1 Rulebook
1 Market Board
4 Reference Sheets
6 Civilization Sheets
20 Map Tiles
33 Plastic Figures
Nearly 300 Cards
55 Combat Cards
Hundreds of Markers and Tokens
6 Trade Dials
6 Economy Dials

Also in this box is the Fame and Fortune expansion. This has also never been touched and contents are in excellent condition.

    <notes>Includes both expansions (Fame and Fortune _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Wisdom and Warfare). This game has never been played. I have always wanted to sit down and dig into this game but my gaming group just never got around to it. I would rather let it go to someone who will enjoy it than just let it sit on my game shelf. All pieces are stored neatly and sorted out. Comes with the original box and the Wisdom and Warfare box. (I managed to fit all pieces into these two nicely) I take pride in caring for my game collection and this item is in mint condition.</notes>

[b]Shipping will be $19[/b]
[b]**This listing includes both the Fame _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Fortune and Wisdom _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Warfare Expansions**[/b]
All components are spread out among the base game box and the 1st expansion box.
The box top has some slight shelf/edge/corner wear and some scratches on one side.  The box bottom is mostly in great shape except a part of one edge has torn a bit.  The tear does not go the whole way thru - you can only see the damage on the outside - so it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t seem to be structural.
All components are in excellent shape and some cards are sleeved (geekmail me for details).  There is one plastic card box that holds a good chunk of the cards.
There are plastic compartment boxes holding all of the tokens.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure there are a couple of culture tokens missing (they are tiny!), but nothing is missing that that would affect game play (there are more than enough).
Any replacement cards included in the expansions have replaced their base game versions - the originals are unavailable, however, I do have the original combat cards; let me know if you want them included.
As usual, FFG inserts are completely useless and I have long since thrown them away.
If you have any questions about the exact contents, please feel free to geekmail me.
Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t miss out on a great deal!  B-)</notes>

Everything is in great condition, but I believe a couple of the faction cards are slightly bent (not creased( to fit everything in the box.

Shipping will be more expensive to the rest of Europe, as it will weigh over 2kg, c. £16 or so, but if this does not put you off geekmail me your specific destination and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll confirm an exact price for you.</notes>

    <notes>English first edition, 2010.
Game is playable, however, many of the cards and the Civilization sheets are warped due to poor storage. The box is tired and has a torn corner. Most parts are slightly worn. The following pieces are missing:
1 coin (negligible effect on gameplay)
2 Army flags broken but blue-tacked back together
Wound tokens missing - will need to be replaced by either some red tokens or markers
Otherwise everything is present. The rulebook states that there are 20 market resources, however, this was a typo and a quick check of google confirms there are only 16 market resources included.
Bargain at £10! Happy to ship anywhere but you will have to pay postage.</notes>

    <notes>Played about five times. Minor scuffs to the edges of the box from transport otherwise in good condition. I have painstakingly verified all components are in the box, the internals of which are only organised using the bags that came with the box (so it can be mildly chaotic upon opening).

Components very good, boxes with little shelf wear. Two boxes were on one side a little bit lighter (from the sunlight), but undamaged! From a smoke free home
From the expansions there came some new versions of some base cards which replace the older once. These redundand cards are not available anymore. Of course you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need them to play the game!

    <notes>English edition from Fantasy Flight Games.
Condition: very good, game has been played about 5 times.
The box insert has been removed, and there are 2 culture tokens less than stated in the rulebook (88 instead of 90). I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never seen a game where you run out of those tokens, so they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t essential.
Payment via IBAN bank transfer (preferred) or Paypal.
Shipping costs
Note: the box is close to 2 kg, so with packaging it may go over 2 kg. This means that shipment with PostNL to Europe and worldwide will be more expensive.
Netherlands: € 6,50 via PostNL to your home address or € 4,50 via DPD to a pickup point.
Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, France, Austria, United Kingdom: € 13 via PostNL to your home address; or € 9,50 via DPD to a pickup point.
Italy, Spain, Sweden: € 13 via PostNL.
Rest of Europe: € 18,50 via PostNL.
Rest of the world: €24,30 via PostNL.</notes>
