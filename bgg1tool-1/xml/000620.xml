   <description>This game was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming.  The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A complete game of WE THE PEOPLE includes:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;50 Round Playing Pieces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;14 Rectangular Playing Pieces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;66 Hexagonal Playing Pieces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;2 Square Playing Pieces_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 8 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; x 11_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Player Reference Card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One Rules Booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One Historical Commentary Booklet_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;96 Strategy Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;64 Battle Cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;13 Plastic General Stands_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;One 6-sided Die_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This item is new and except for the fact that it has been removed from the shrinkwrap.  The game is complete.  The card decks are both still in shrinkwrap, the counters are unpunched and the stands have not been seperated.  
There is no wear on the box except for some very minor rubbing on the bottom corners where there is some white showing.  There is some minor light creasing on the bottom right corner.
I take Paypal, personal check, Money Order or Cashiers Check.  Personal checks must clear before the item is shipped.
Buyer to pay actual shipping costs + delivery confirmation.  I will ship internationally, and will combine shipping for multiple items.

    <notes>Game is 100% complete and unplayed.  Well over half of the pieces are still unpunched in the counter sheet.  The rest of the contents are in very good condition, the rules having been read once or twice.  The box has moderate wear.  One corner of the lid has been split but well mended with an invisible glue.  There are some xerox copies from the General magazine concerning We The People.  I would be happy to post pictures upon request.
This game is in a large box.  I will provide exact shipping costs once I know the buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s zip code.  International buyers will need to contact me for rates.</notes>

    <notes>Played and 100% complete copy. The contents are in excellent condition. The box has slight wear along the edges of the lid but is rock solid with no split corners.
Buyer to pay actual postage for USPS Priority Mail.  Unfortunately the game is too large for the Flat Rate boxes.  I will be happy to quote shipping based on your location prior to you placing an order.   Optional insurance would be an additional $1.65. International buyers need to contact me for rates and are required to pay using Paypal. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m always more than willing to combine shipping for multiple orders. I ship using boxes and appropriate packing material.

Will ship after paid in full, checks and MOs accepted, but need to be cleared. PayPal fees resulting from paying with a Debit/Credit Card will be passed to the buyer.
Shipping and handling is covered by buyer, and should be around $12 - $15.
I will send the buyer quotes for different options, and you can pick your preferred shipping option (from USPS). Insurance is $1.35 and optional, but recommended as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not responsible for mailing issues once the game is mailed.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 68oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

The only condition issue is general shelfwear and a small-ish ding in the top edge of the box lid.
You will not get hosed on shipping! I use Priority _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Regional Rate_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; boxes and Parcel Post to save $$$. Big packages can work out to $2-3 per game!
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I take USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept standard Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments under the following terms: Your grand total will include a number sufficient to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after paying Paypal their fees, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the full purchase price, INCLUDING the shipping.
I also am happy to take ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price plus exact postage. Sending a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment means you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be trusting your seller (i.e. me), which is no different than the way every mail order transaction EVER worked prior to 1998 or so.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, click the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tab, and then make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees [and you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see why sellers hate paypal fees so darn much].)</notes>

    <notes>Complete game with Avalon Hill expansion cards. The game has been played and enjoyed many times, but has plenty of life left in it for those who prefer this old gem to its GMT offspring.I have not played this game since Washington_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s War came out.  Box shows some wear and the state-line demarcations have been highlighted with a black marker for clarity. This is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy and will make a great augment if you already own the game and want to combine parts, etc. The expansion cards are great and add flavor to this seminal design by Mark Herman.  I ship same or next day--priority mail USA  $15.00 </notes>

    <notes>The game is UNpunched and was never played.  However, the box was under a couch and was damaged when a spring broke.  The box cover was damaged significantly when this happened.  The board also has a  2 to 3 inch scrape in it.  A green and orange marker and should make the board look decent.  I also underlined some terms on the player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s aid boxes.
The rules have been heavily highlighted and underlined.  They are messy and you would definitely need to obtain a new set of rules online.  However, the Historical Commentary book is unmarked.  All components are present. (please see photos).
BONUS:  The game also includes a a copy of Volume 29, #2 of the General magazine, which has articles on this and other games.  That issue is unmarked.
Please E-mail me if you have any questions about the game.
The game will be shipped within 1 to 2 business days after receiving payment via PayPal, Money Order or Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Check. Thank you for reviewing my listing.
I will ship the game by using a USPS Priority Mail large flat rate game box at a cost of $18.75.</notes>
