   <description>From the Publisher:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hive is a highly addictive strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface. Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Hive FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>3rd Edition with bakelite pieces. Game is complete and like-new but there is no box. The tiles just come in the included (nice) zippered bag, which also has the rules. Except for the missing box, everything could be off-the-shelf.
Shipping weight is 1lb 10oz. Shipping will be via Priority Mail from ZIP 95014, so figure about $7.50 to the Midwest, less if you are closer.</notes>

    <notes>Hive (3rd edition) with the bakelite pieces. Played once or twice then packed away. Excellent condition. The free carry case was never touched. There is a hair line crack in the white plastic packaging that holds the bakelite pieces but that was there when I bought it. You can see it slightly in the photo next to the bottom left grasshopper. Excellent condition none the less. I would be very happy buying this, as it is in exactly the same condition I bought it in brand new.</notes>

    <notes>Tangent Games (TCI 001)
Hive is a highly addictive strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface. Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving.
With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The player to totally surround his opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s queen wins the game.

Contents: These are the original wooden pieces with the silver and blue decals. A fair number of the decals have some lines where they were not placed on properly. This doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect the game in any way and all the pieces are totally distinquishable. Other than the decal issues, the pieces are in like new condition (the game came this way) and the rule books (one in English and one in German) are in mint condition!
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 2 Lbs. International bidders are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>Smart Zone Games (TCI 001)
THE NATURE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S CHESS 
Keeping one eye on the Hive and the other on your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reserves, the tension builds as one wrong move will see your Queen Bee quickly engulfed. Choose the best tactics to place the right piece wisely and be the first to block the Queen Bee in the Hive.
Each tile has a unique way of moving (like in chess) and resembles the movement of the insect depicted on the tile.  For instance, the grasshopper is the only tile which can jump.
Hive is a fun game to play because of its simple rules, yet challenging for its depth.  Hive enhances each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s skills of strategic planning, tactical thinking and spatial vision.  To win, you must play both the offense (surround your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bee) and the defense (to protect your queen bee).
 
A nice decorative storage bag makes it easy to carry, store and play anywhere. </notes>

    <notes>Very nice shape, except that the box insert is cracked and messed up. Has no effect on anything, as you keep the pieces in a bag, and the external box is great. Should be a 2 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.

I prefer payment via Amazon.com TextPayMe... this is very easy to do and free for both parties. I accept other forms of payment as well, just prefer ones without fees! Shipping is $10 via USPS, though differences over $2 will be refunded.

    <notes>Original edition with wooden pieces.  Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>Smart Zone Games (TCI001)
THE NATURE_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S CHESS: Keeping one eye on the Hive and the other on your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s reserves, the tension builds as one wrong move will see your Queen Bee quickly engulfed. Choose the best tactics to place the right piece wisely and be the first to block the Queen Bee in the Hive. Each tile has a unique way of moving (like in chess) and resembles the movement of the insect depicted on the tile. For instance, the grasshopper is the only tile which can jump. Hive is a fun game to play because of its simple rules, yet challenging for its depth. Hive enhances each player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s skills of strategic planning, tactical thinking and spatial vision. To win, you must play both the offense (surround your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bee) and the defense (to protect your queen bee). A nice decorative storage bag makes it easy to carry, store and play anywhere.</notes>

    <notes>Bundle including the following:
Hive Base Game
2 copies of Hive: The Mosquito Expansion
2 copies of Hive: The Pillbug Expansion
2 copies of Hive: The Ladybug Expansion
Pocket Edition tiles from the Expansions are NOT included. Expansion clamshells not included. Only one copy of each Expansion Rulebook is included.
Box has minor shelf wear. Rules, tiles, pouch, and insert are in excellent, near new condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a medium size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) or long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>

    <notes>NOTE: this is an early wooden edition, not the later bakerlite editions.
Bought new, played never, put away.  In excellent condition, never opened (it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sold in shrink wrap). English rules.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games.
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. Europe - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
USA / CAN - Royal Mail up to 2kg - various services and prices, ask for info. Over 2kg, ship by Parcelforce. 
Other locations will research when I get an order. I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.
On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. 
If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know me from a hole in the ground. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.</notes>
