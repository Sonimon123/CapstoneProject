   <description>This solitaire game of the Battle of Britain is card-driven with card decks covering Events, Attacking Forces and suspected targets. Game mechanisms deal with Radar warning(and lack of), weather and observer corps. The cardstock map covers southern England with graphics for airfields, industrial sites and ports._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the back of the box:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You control British, Commonwealth, Polish and Czech Air Force Squadrons, positioning the day's patrols where you believe the Nazis will strike. Day after bloody day, the RAF must rise to battle the modern fighters of Luftflotte 2 and 3 while Nazi bombers pound England into ruin - and submission. You must intercept German bombers, sacrificing dwindling men and equipment to halt the German war machine._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game system controls the Luftwaffe, directing a coherent bombing campaign against targets vital to British survival. A unique card system hides the strengths, compositions, and targets of the German strikes until after you've decided where your squadrons will patrol, and which raids you'll intercept. You make the decisions that could save democracy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;RAF offer three scenarios.

The box has some marker pen writing on the cover (just a few numbers written at the bottom) and some wear and tear but is OK for storage purposes.</notes>

    <notes>Okay, I will be honest with you, I think $39 is too much for you to pay for this game.  However, with one just selling for $80, another for $72, and Troll _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Toad asking $116, I figure I’ll offer this one for your consideration.
As you can probably tell from the picture, this is the West End Games version of RAF.
This game is in great shape and its raves from fellow geeks is well deserved.  It was sold to me as “complete” but alas, the seller lied.  Imagine that!  However,  I will not do the same to you.  I inventoried everything and one German Me109 fighter plane is missing (II/JG 2 a 1o0 3 plane).  This is not a big deal as it is easy to use a substitute counter.  I’ve included two blank 5/8” counters for this purpose.  I always planned to print out a replacement for this plane using the counter images here on the geek but have not gotten around to it.
The picture is of the actual game for sale.  Write with any questions.
I only ask for actual postage, estimated at $6 for priority mail in the US.  Better yet, stop by and pick it up!

    <notes>Game is complete.  I have downloaded and made new counters for the game; the old counters are present also and in good condition.  There is an additional set of cards for the game.  The box has some wear, the components have very little wear and the map has some wear including a few very small ink spots.  I can ship with either USPS for U.S. buyers or via the German postal system for European buyers.</notes>

    <notes>RAF. 1986 - J. Butterfield. 
Thought I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have time to invest in the game but since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not looking likely, I might as well pass it on (incidentally, selling it for the exact same price I paid for it - quite cheap if you ask me!)
Like new, opened but unplayed copy. 
Cards and counters unpunched. Tray, map, etc. untouched. 
Counter sheets are slightly warped. 
Box in very good condition. 
Postage to UK: £5.6 max (Royal Mail, more likely going to be £2.6 if I can keep parcel under 1kg; game is 580g)
Postage to Europe: £9
Postage elsewhere: £13-16 depending on destination

My late husband was an avid board game collector/player.  He collected almost 1600 games, not all have been played.   If they were played, no food or drinks were allowed by the games during play.   He took excellent care of all his games.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>This game was never played and the counters are unpunched.  However, a few of the counters have fallen out of their frame.  The game cards are still in shrink wrap.  The rules, however, have been highlighted and underlined.  They are kind of messy in some areas.  You may want to see if you can obtain a copy of the rules on Boardgamegeek or on another game site.  All components are present.
Please e-mail me if you have any questions.
Thank you for reviewing my listing.  I usually like to ship games by using a USPS medium flat rate box at a cost of $13.45</notes>

    <notes>This solitaire game of the Battle of Britain is card-driven with card decks covering Events, Attacking Forces and suspected targets. Game mechanisms deal with Radar warning(and lack of), weather and observer corps. The cardstock map covers southern England with graphics for airfields, industrial sites and ports.
From the back of the box:
You control British, Commonwealth, Polish and Czech Air Force Squadrons, positioning the day_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s patrols where you believe the Nazis will strike. Day after bloody day, the RAF must rise to battle the modern fighters of Luftflotte 2 and 3 while Nazi bombers pound England into ruin - and submission. You must intercept German bombers, sacrificing dwindling men and equipment to halt the German war machine.
The game system controls the Luftwaffe, directing a coherent bombing campaign against targets vital to British survival. A unique card system hides the strengths, compositions, and targets of the German strikes until after you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve decided where your squadrons will patrol, and which raids you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll intercept. You make the decisions that could save democracy.
RAF offer three scenarios. The Hardest Days, The Thin Blue Line, and The Battle of Britain cover the entire struggle from beginning to end. The game is playable in as few as 3 hours or as many as 10.
RAF includes:
    One full-color 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 34_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; map of southern England
    160 full-color counters
    143 target, event, and force cards (the rule book contains a misprint)
    16-page rules book
    One six-sided die
    Counter tray with lock-on lid
Game scale is Gruppen and Squadrons with one-day turns.
For one player.
Three to ten hours to play.
Ages 12 and up.
Postage £3.00 2nd class UK
