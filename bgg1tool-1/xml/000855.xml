   <description>Java is a fascinating island with great potential for development _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; especially the undeveloped area of central Java with its fertile soil and rich natural resources. These riches are much desired by the rulers of the regions that surround central Java. Each player, as one of the Javanese rulers, tries to develop the region for themselves. Each wants to bring their culture and control to these undeveloped areas. The players irrigate the land and cultivate new rice fields; they build villages and palaces, and create cities from the villages._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player desires to be the dominant force in the development of this new area. Players earn fame points for building and enlarging palaces, for creating irrigation systems, and for arranging palace festivals. The player with the most fame points after the final scoring wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Java is the second game of the Mask Trilogy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Only played twice. No markings on tiles or cards, and no wear shown on either. I rounded off the original sharp corners of the cards very nicely with one of those corner rounders you can get from scrapbook stores. This is the Rio Grande English edition. If you have Tikal to trade, I would consider it a done deal. :)</notes>

    <notes>English edition from Rio Grande.  New and still sealed.  There is a small rip to the shrink at one of the corner.
Java is an oversize box and does not fit into the standard Priority Mail box provided by USPS.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect shipping to be more than $10 if your zip code starts with a 6 or less.  However, west coast will most likely cost more since I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be able to use the Flat Rate shipping option.</notes>

Hello, these are the game(s) you won in my recent auction.  Please respond with the mailing address you want this shipped to (or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be picking it up from me) so I know how much to charge you for shipping.
If you have a strong shipping preference please let me know else I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just go with whatever is cheapest.
If you plan on picking them up from me in Dallas or San Antonio please let me know, if you haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t already.
Thanks for your bids and hope this finds you well.
Allen

As the game weighs over 2kg, it is difficult (expensive!) to ship internationally.  Probably not too bad to Europe, but for the USA, probably need to consider a big (6-8kg) order.  Happy to discuss.</notes>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 5 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete copy of the Ravensburger version of Java.  It is the German language version, but there is no text at all on the pieces.  Only the rulebook is in German, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a printout of the rules in English.
All the pieces are punched and bagged.  All the parts (cardboard fields and palaces, player aids, wooden pieces, cards, rulebook, and board) are in excellent condition.  The top of the box has a ~2 inch light crease on one side, probably from the game I had stacked on top of it. The bottom of the box shows very slight wear in the corners.
Shipping for this game will be based on your location.  As a rough guide, shipping within the US will likely be at most $13 (for parcel post) or $19 (for priority mail). Note that I do reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount. (I charge an estimate of the actual shipping cost.)</notes>

    <notes>Great condition, German Ravensburger edition.  Has only been played once, maybe twice.  All components look new, box has slight shelf wear.  I guarantee all components are present, and back that up with pieces from my personal copy of the game.  I generally ship USPS Priority Mail, and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this will fit into a flat rate box.  If it does, shipping will be $10.70.  Ships from 96789.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande version. Complete and in great shape. Only played once. Smoke free household.
Combined shipping available on multiple purchases so check out my other items for sale.
I ship via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation were possible. I only charge you what it costs me to ship the game and I will try to ship without flat rate shipping where weight and distance would result in a lower price. For international shipping there may be some restrictions on where I will ship to. Please contact me before purchasing. </notes>

    <notes>This is an unplayed copy of Java. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been punched, and the box has some shelf wear (whitened corners). The insert has a small crack in the plastic. The game has been packed well for shipping (pieces won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be all willy-nilly when it arrives). 
I will ship via USPS after payment is received (and shipping costs determined) unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like it shipped some other way. I will combine shipping with multiple items and charge only the actual shipping cost. From US zip code: 97520.

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white).
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you.
USPS money order is a good second choice. Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If you (the receiver) elects to not pay extra for insurance (totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.</notes>

    <notes>Played once, minor shelf wear.  Insert has been removed because it did not do well when storing game on its side.  Instead I use a Plano case (see picture) which you can buy for an extra $4.
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the storage container included and add the additional price. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for 90oz to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>The game has been played a couple of times and is complete and in tip-top condition. Does show its age somewhat, with a little shelf wear here and there. Contents are pristine however.
Comes with German rules and a print-out of the English version. (No language dependent components other than the rules themselves)
Postage in the UK is £6, please ask for a quote on other locations (box is very large so it will likely be rather costly).</notes>

    <notes>I bought this game in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.  We played it once.  We enjoyed it, but since we liked Tikal and Mexica better, this game just doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get played.  The cards are crisp and look like new.  The box is sturdy and in very good shape.  It has some white at the corners, and there is a 1/2 inch white mark (box paint got scuffed off) on one edge of the box.</notes>
