   <description>In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever - subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building while also selling his services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.</notes>

You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever - subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building while also selling his services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.</notes>

When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.</notes>

    <notes>Bezier Games (BEZCAST)
In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever - subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building while also selling his services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent condition. All items inventoried. All cards were sleeved before the first play _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; are in perfect condition (sleeves will not be included in the sale). Box and tiles are also in excellent condition. Bezier doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use inserts but I will secure items inside the box to prevent jostling or damage during transit.
CONUS shipping only. Buyer to pay for USPS shipping from 95062, which averages $20 for a box that will fit (large flat rate is a little too small).</notes>

    <notes>Bézier Games (BEZCAST)
In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever - subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building while also selling his services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.</notes>

    <notes>Players are architects laying out their designs for the King. They score points for the ways their selected rooms, corridors and spaces connect (or not). A clever sort-of-auction mechanism decides who gets what pieces.
The price shown is for UK/EU purchasers (and includes VAT). For purchasers outside the EU, the price is £26.67 (net of UK tax - note that the purchaser is responsible for paying any duty or tax due on import to their country).
I charge shipping at cost, as follows.
  UK addresses: myHermes (2-3 days, tracked) £4.30
  Other EU countries: Air mail (1 week or so) £13.14
  Europe outside the EU: Air mail (1 week or so) £10.95
  Australasia: Air mail (about 1 week, no tracking) £17.70
  USA, Canada and elsewhere: Air mail (about 1 week, no tracking) £16.35</notes>

    <notes>Bézier Games (BEZCAST)
In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever - subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s building while also selling his services to other players. In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards. After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.</notes>

    <notes>This game is complete and all components are in very good condition. I acquired this in a trade and a previous owner blued in a some custom foam inserts to organize the various sizes of room tiles. The big triangular auction board has two corners showing wear from bouncing around in the box, but nothing that detracts from game play. The game box is in great shape.</notes>

    <notes>Opened but un-played. Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags. I will work with you to ship the most cost efficient way or however you prefer. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. If the item is a small card game the shipping will be USPS First Class and will be around $5 total with shipping materials. Local pickup with no shipping available if you live in the Seattle area.</notes>

    <notes>German edition from Bézier Games. Language independent apart from the rules - there are room names on the tiles, but they have no function in gameplay. A printed copy of the English rules is included.
Condition is very good, the game has only been played once or twice.
Note: there is a misprint in the German rules for the number of bonus cards - it says there should be 28, where there are actually 27. The correct number is in the English rules and on Boardgamegeek.
Payment via IBAN bank transfer (preferred) or Paypal.

    <notes>Used but Unique and very rare board game “Zamki szalonego króla Ludwika” (“Castles of mad king Ludwig”)
Polish version with wonderful and unique ilustrations made by Agnieszka Dąbrowiecka (check out attached photos).
The game which you can find on photos is a real product which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling. If you want more pictures, please do not hesitate to send me a priv message.
It is a complete game - it contains all components and Polish instruction. It also contains all fixed/correct tiles.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m adding also 1 additional tile from exclusive Polish castles tiles - from kickstarter (on the second picture - it is the last tile on the left _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Podziemne stajnie_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).
