   <description>Container is a game about big ships and big production.  Each player will play both as a producer and shipper of goods.  Players will decide which products they want to produce, and which of the OTHER players' goods they want to ship out to a remote island.  During these phases, players will be able to set the prices for their goods and try to maximize their cash!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once the goods have reached the island, players will play the part of the purchaser for their tiny island. Players bid for the goods arriving each day by ship, and the highest bidder collects these goods for conversion into points at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sounds simple?  It is! But the real challenge is turning your home production into goods for your island.  Your government is willing to subsidize your purchases, but just how much money do you want to give to your competitors for that lovely crate of goods your island desperately needs?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Valley Games (VLY 201)
The team of Franz-Benno Delonge and Thomas Ewert invite you to play Container!
Container is a game about big ships and big production. Each player will play both the producer and shipper of goods. Players will decide which products they want to produce, and which of the OTHER players’ goods they want to ship out to a remote island. During these phases, players will be able to set the prices for their goods and try to maximize their cash!
Once the goods have reached the island, players will play the part of the purchaser for their tiny island. Players bid for the goods arriving each day by ship, and the highest bidder collects these goods for conversion into points at the end of the game.
Sounds simple? It is! But the real challenge is turning heavy industry production into goods for your island. Your government is willing to subsidize your purchases, but just how much money do you want to give to your competitors for that lovely crate of goods your island desperately needs?
Complete artwork by Mike Doyle. Container takes approximately 90 minutes to play, and is for 3-5 players.

    <notes>This game is in very good condition.  I played it once.  The game was a bit heavy for my family.  All pieces are present and I have the special plastic containers that shipped with this game when folks placed pre-orders.  The ships, which were cast in a plaster like material, are in good shape.  They have one or two little chips (they shipped from Valley Games this way).  Any other questions about the condition of it, lemme know.</notes>

Never played, pristine condition!  Hand-built tuck boxes included.  Optional plano container can be included for $5 extra (see photo).  May not include the original box insert.
When ordering, please be sure to let me know if you want the Plano box included and add the additional cost to the total.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask for the container I will move the components into baggies before shipping.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail.  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal.  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Great game but only could get my group to play a few times.
It has resin ships and wood blocks for the containers of goods.
Everything is in Like New condition. Played at most five times with my gaming group.  One of my gaming group didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get the game so would try to hoard his _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;containers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rather than trade them....
Think a box corner is ripped but it is in great shape beyond that. 
Shipping will be $12 via Priority Mail USPS.
International shipping ask for quote.</notes>

    <notes>Bought at Essen 2007 and never played this copy - no shrink wrap (can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember if it came with this or not)but the cards are still in shrink etc. Very slight warping on the player boards which I would expect will settle if placed under some books for a day or so.
I will be in the USA late February so can post from there to minimize shipping costs if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s helpful.</notes>

    <notes>Description: Container in mint/sealed condition (I also have Container: The Second Shipment available and will discount $10 if ordering both).
Shipping Weight:  4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

Will Ship Worldwide with shipping costs payed by the buyer. 
Shipping from Europe so buyers from outside of the EU should know there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a high possibility of Custom Taxes.
I have many games in the Marketplace so check them out to see if you have interest in more than one, you can probably make some savings on shipping.
Shipping Costs to European Countries should be:
_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;= 2000 grams
Correio Não Prioritário (Avião) Internacional = 11.75€
Correio Azul Internacional Exprèss = 15,5€
2001 grams to 3000 grams = 29.10€
3001 grams to 4000 grams = 30.25€
4001 grams to 5001 grams = 33€
5001 grams to 6000 grams = 36.90€
6001 grams to 7000 grams = 38€
7001 grams to 8000 grams = 40.50€
8001 grams to 9000 grams = 43€
9001 grams to 10000 grams = 45.5€
There can be bigger weight categories if needed

    <notes>A copy of container. The game is complete - see below notes.
The game is in acceptable condition, almost good, but bgg are very precise in terms of what these descriptions mean so the game is sold as being acceptable. I have attached pictures for every point mentioned. 
The rules have been read, and are in good condition.
The boards all have signs of use - for example the undersurfaces of them are marked from rubbing against the insert in the box. The player mat don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sit quite flush with table surface - this wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t bother me, but I list it for completion - see picture. This could probably be fixed.
One board has rubbing at one point, the affected area is about 1cm long - see picture.
The cards are in good condition, with some signs of use.
The boats, which are weirdly (though it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also cool) made of ceramic, have rubbed each other in the box and have marked each other (see pictures) with a few small chips around the edges - see pictures. 
The box is worn, but will hold up, the undersurface of the lid is marked by the player mats rubbing against it. 
The wooden components are complete in number, though there is one fewer tan machine component and one additional orange, so the total number is correct - see pic. Though this wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect game play and the colours are quite close anyway.
Overall this is a used copy container, with signs of wear, but still totally playable. I have done my best here to describe the condition of the game. If any other info is needed do ask. I am amenable to trades and offers on this and all the games that I have listed on here. I only ship within the U.K generally, but if you price further a field for me, I would consider it. I do discounted postage for multiple purchases. Shipping is royal mail signed for.</notes>

    <notes>It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing the official rules, which were printed in black and white in english and french. The colors of the box have faded a bit. There is a slight curve of the back of the box and some shelf wear. It is signed by one of the authors.
The sides of the cards are not as white as they originally were, as the game has been played.
Otherwise, the content is in excellent condition. All ships intact.

    <notes>Item for user charlievmorgan only, to be purchased bundled with expansion (listed separately).  Full condition as follows:
In shrink, but box bottom is bowed in concavely. I wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t describe it as dishing, which would be the result of having improperly stored on it on top of another box. Rather, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a pretty uniform curve from edge to edge such that there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a gap between the shrink and the box at all places on the bottom except the edges themselves, which I can only think of as a production error.</notes>

    <notes>Container (2007 - Valley Games)
Box is structurally sound, but has some wear/whiting along edges and dishing on the box bottom.  Game is nearly complete, only missing two of the money cards.  The brown machines and containers have been written on with a marker to distinguish them.  All cards are sleeved and components bagged.
Buyer pays for shipping. I will ship this internationally, but it will be expensive.

    <notes>Box is in great shape with very minor whitening on a few corners.  Components are complete and in excellent condition, with the exception of one ship which was expertly glued after breaking.  You can only see a small crack underneath it upon inspection and it is completely smooth.  You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d never really notice it unless you looked for it.
I will ship this for $10.00 in the continental US.

    <notes>It includes the expansion Second Shipment (but not the box of the expansion).
Condition: Complete game (no missing pieces). All components in good condition. Rules most likely will have handwritten clarifications on them.
Game price and Shipping cost depends on the 3 regions.
If you are in Canada, game price is in Canadian $ and shipping is 20 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, game price is in US $ and shipping is 30 US$.
If you are in EU, game price is in Euros and shipping is 80 Euros.
Shipping is the same for multiple items.
Payment: PayPal only.
My Paypal username is :
pnomikos@cogeco.ca
If you are in Canada, you pay in CDN$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in the USA, you pay in US$ (game price and shipping).
If you are in EU, you pay in Euros (game price and shipping).
Example:
The price of the game is 10$.
If you are in Canada, your total cost is 10+20=30 CDN$.
If you are in the USA, your total cost is 10+30=40 US$.
If you are in EU, your total cost is 10+80=90 Euros.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;fair / acceptable_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.
All cards have been sleeved.
All brown pieces were painted to look more like brown, rather than the original dark-tan. (See attached pictures for actual color)
The game is considered to be in acceptable condition because of the following:
1. Box has plenty of shelf wear. (Dents and dings)
2. Box has a stain on the front cover. (Near the clouds / sky)
2. Slight staining / darkening of the cards_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; edges -- Occurred prior to sleeving them.

All components are in great shape, but the box has shelf wear.
Also, the orange containers all have a black sharpie dot on all sides. This was to distinguish them from another container of similar color to help a color-blind friend play the game. I recommend you keep the dots even for non-color-blind players, but it is easily solved with orange paint.</notes>
