The usual administrivia: I‚Äôll ship anywhere you‚Äôre willing to pay the freight to, in or out of the U.S. If shipped outside the U.S., I will not declare the purchase as a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;gift_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. I prefer money orders or checks, but can also handle PayPal (PayPal is better for international deals from my experience). From a smoke-free house. 
Shoot me a message if you have any questions.

    <notes>Sorry to say, with my current group, this game will never hit the table.
I checked it out, love the components and maps, but with no chance of playing, its should go to someone who might actually get a play or two out of it.
The game was being prepped for play, and while the counters are unpunched, in prep for play they have been clear coat for addional protection. 
The box also has a small bow in the bottom from sitting on the shelf. It sat flat so I am not sure how the bow happened. 
Smoke free environment.
Feel free to geekmail me with any questions.

Brand new.  Unpunched and unplayed.  Only broke the shrinkwrap when I received it to make sure everything was present and in perfect condition.
Beautiful looking game, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m never going to play it and I couldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t justify holding onto it when so many people are trying to find a copy.
Please contact me with any questions or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like pictures.  I realize that I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sold on BGG before, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been trading here and selling on ebay and rec.games.board for many years.

    <notes>This is the ziplock copy, it do not comes with a box, but beside that, everything is in new mint, unplayed, unpunched condition.
Buyer pays actual shipping plus a few dimes and nickles to cover gas and time, I usually round the amount up to the nearest dollar for that.
Since this does it comes with a box, it will be easier to ship and the cost will be lower, but still it is a big and heavy game. 
I can give accurate quotes to foreign buyers if interested.</notes>

The game is un-played, but I did read the manual pretty thoroughly (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s got some light wear) and, as mentioned, the counters have been punched.  Otherwise the components are in perfect condition.

    <notes>The counters have been punched but not clipped.
All components in very good condition indeed. The counters show no signs of handling/wear. The mapsheets are excellent, as are the player-aid cards.
The Exclusive rules and Game rules booklets are in very good shape, though they have been neatly annotated (a very small amount) in places and there is a very small tear at the top of the spine on the Exclusive Rules/Scenario booklet. The Historical booklet is in great shape with no annotations.
I have personally matched every counter against a unpunched set of countersheets and they are all there.
Please contact me for shipping costs, especially if you live outside the UK.
I pack very safely/securely.

Some of the markers were punched, lightly clipped and sorted in plastic ziplog bags (see photos). The rest of the counter sheets are intact.
Buyer covers shipping costs. Paypal allowed but Bank transfer prefered. The game is not huge nor weights a ton, but it has some dimensions, so if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get back to you with the shipping details. European buyers in countries covered by Mondial Relay service are welcome. Other European interested parties will have to pay more for the game being shipped to them via the Postal Service.
El juego est√° intacto, exceptuando algunos marcadores, repartidos en bolsitas de pl√°stico. Obviamente nunca lleg√≥ a jugarse.
El pago ser√≠a por transferencia o ingreso bancario. No hay problema en pagar por Paypal, siempre y cuando el comprador aporte 7‚Ç¨ para cubrir una parte de la comisi√≥n que impone este servicio.
El env√≠o se realizar√≠a por Correos. Los precios van cambiando y en caso de inter√©s s√≥lo tienes que preguntar antes de efectuar la compra. Puesto que el comprador asume los gastos, estoy abierto a cualquier otro tipo de env√≠o (mensajer√≠a, etc.) El servicio que proporciona Kiala (kiala.es) es otra opci√≥n m√°s econ√≥mica y c√≥moda que depender√° del comprador y que recomiendo debido a su tarifa plana de 5‚Ç¨ hasta 8 kg.</notes>

    <notes>My copy of The Devil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Cauldron is in mint shape. The counters are unpunched, and the maps haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even been unfolded.
Shipping to Canada will be $18, and to the US $28.
If you buy this in combination with either Where Eagles Dare or The Greatest Day, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine the shipping.</notes>

Unpunched and unplayed.  A little bit of wear to corners of the box but otherwise as-new.

Payment can be made by PayPal or by Amazon eGift card.  If you want to pay by PayPal and prefer to get a formal PayPal invoice before paying let me know and I will send you one.
I will happily combine shipping on multiple items.</notes>

    <notes>Note that this is a combined The Devil_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Cauldron AND Where Eagles May Dare set.  TDC is punched and clipped and stored in counter trays.    WED is unpunched.  Both are complete.  I am only selling them together as a set.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll never play these and someone who enjoys the scale of these games can really enjoy them.
Please note that these are heavy games, so it will be expensive to ship to places in the US.  If you live in Ottawa or Montreal, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure we can work out a no-ship solution.
If you would like to see more photos to see the games in more detail, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d be happy to do so, please just contact me.</notes>

    <notes>Punched, nicely clipped. Parts in very good shape. All present and accounted for except the counters, which I believe to be complete, but I ain_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t counting. The box is sound but showing its age. Priced accordingly. 
You pay actual USPS priority mail shipping, but brace yourself because this is big and heavy. I checked shipping to California and it is $35. The closer you live to New York, the cheaper it gets.</notes>
