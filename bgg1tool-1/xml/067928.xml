Puzzle Strike is a complete game in a box that has the fun of a customizable card game without the marketing scheme of selling you parts of the game in random packs. You build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each game. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you're on the edge of losing, you're also able to do even more combos than usual._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Shuffling cards takes too long and is boring, so in Puzzle Strike you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle!

    <notes>Only played a few times.  Please be aware this is a first run printing and the quality on some of the chips leaves something to be desired.  This is definitely a problem with a minority of the chips, but there are some with issues with blurry text and smudges.  </notes>

Puzzle Strike is a game for 2, 3, or 4 players with a lot of back-and-forth craziness and wild combos. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s played with chips instead of cards because they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re easier to shuffle. Choose from 10 Fantasy Strike characters (all included), each with three ability chips. Games should take 20 or 30 minutes once you have the hang of it, and even your non-gamer friends will probably enjoy it.</notes>

    <notes>Presented for sale here is a pristine copy of Puzzle Strike 2nd Edition by Sirlin Games. As described on the box, Puzzle Strike is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;a card game played with chips instead of cards that simulates a puzzle game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; However you describe it, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a blast to play and it holds up well to repeated variation of the bank of puzzle chips and the selected character chips.
Like most of my games, my copy is just barely opened. I slit the cellophane—which is still covering the box lid—and punched out the chips from their sprues, but, as you can see in the photos, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including the sprues in their original cellophane, should you wish to slot the chips back in. I did play with my copy of the game a few times, during which the box never traveled more than ten feet from the storage cabinet to the gaming table. Otherwise, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been in storage, out of sunlight, with no exposure to smoke.
This is one of my favorite games, but it turned out that my main gaming partner had bought a copy too right after I bought this one, and we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been playing with his copy rather than mine. Since my copy is still in such good condition, I figured it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s wiser to sell it and make room for a different game.
All the chips are present in the tray, with the puzzle chips sorted alphabetically. Also present are the original chip sprues, the four bags, the rule book, and a second color copy of the rule book I printed myself. The only difference between this copy and an unwrapped copy you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d buy from a store is that the chips are already punched and sorted here, and hence ready for immediate play.
I expect shipping will cost around $11.00 for USPS Priority Mail service.
A few additional high-resolution photos are available here:

Puzzle Strike: Bag of Chips is all that and a bag of chips! Puzzle Strike is a card game played with cardboard chips instead of cards that simulates a puzzle video game called puzzle fighter that, in-turn, simulates the fighting game street fighter that is emulated in puzzle fighter. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t understand any of that, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ok! Puzzle Strike is a complete game in a box that has the fun of a customizable card game without the marketing scheme of selling you parts of the game in random packs. You build your deck -as- you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each game. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game. A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re on the edge of losing, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re also able to do even more combos than usual. Shuffling cards takes too long and is boring, so in Puzzle Strike you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle! Plus, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pretty ballin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; to play a game with chips. Play it on your yacht, impress potential mates, etc. Though the game is fun even if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re terrible at it, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s also balanced for high level play by veteran asymmetric game balancer David Sirlin (Street Fighter HD Remix, Puzzle Fighter HD Remix, Kongai, Yomi, and Flash Duel.) </notes>
