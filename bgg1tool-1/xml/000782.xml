   <description>A race meeting consisting of 6 races, each with 6 horses of varying power and characteristics.  Board shows an oval track of six lanes, straightforward in straights but graduated on the curves.  Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Originally released as part of the 3M Sports Games line._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Amazing condition (possibly unplayed?). Complete with all pieces. Some shelf wear, no major box damage. Avalon Hill/Sports Illustrated version. 1977
Detailed description:  Side of box has a small piece of tape that is barely coming off and has slightly lifted the backing.  Rule book has a marking on the first page at the bottom (looks like a piece of tape had been applied and then removed).  Other than that, this thing looks great.  When I opened the board it looked like it had never been opened.

    <notes>1977 Avalon Hill Bookcase version.  The box shows wear (especially on the corners) although only one corner is torn.  It appears that all the pieces are here (6 horses, 6 “Official Programs” and rules.  There are two dice, though one appears to be non-original.  The prior owner also made up some farm ID cards by copying the pack of the rules, and also created what appears to be an odds board.  For all that work, the game could not have been played much, as nearly all of the betting sheets are present.  In addition, the board appears to be in very good condition and I found no marks on it. I will charge $10 for shipping to the continental U.S., and shipping plus $2 elsewhere.

    <notes>Avalon hill edition.
Box shows some wear. Otherwise very good condition. Guess the game was played just once or twice (if at all).
Shipping at actual cost dependent on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) board game (surface) costs 13.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Box has some wear on corners, but still in very good shape. The problem is that 4 of the 6 horses are missing. In every other way, this game is complete, and all the components are stellar. Since the horses are simply flat, cheap-looking silhouette type pawns, they can easily be replaced by six different colored pawns from some other game. If you have replacement pawns of some type, buying my copy is a no-brainer for the shape it is in.</notes>

    <notes>*****ALL GAMES  NOW INCLUDE FREE SHIPPING****
This game is part of the series of sports game released by the 3M company during the 1960_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and early 70_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  The series includes Football, Baseball, Hockey, Golf, Auto Racing, Horse Racing and Yacht Racing.  To my knowledge they did not produce a Basketball game.  The 3M catalog was later bought out by Avalon Hill.   These games all have the same basic format - a slender box containing the game components with a wrap-around vinyl playing board.  All of the games feature high quality game parts.
The game parts are in NEAR MINT condition.  The game includes a complete sets of parts.  The horses are free of breaks and other than a bit of wrinkling to a few of the play money bills everything looks brand new.  Overall I would grade the game parts 9 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).  
The game box is in EXCELLENT-NEAR MINT condition.  No splits and no writing or stains.  I would grade it 8-9 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).  The wrap-around vinyl playing board is in EXCELLENT condition.  The snap is still intact.  Just a bit of scuffing to the plastic covering.  I would grade it 8 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).  </notes>

3M
WIN PLACE AND SHOW 
HORSE RACING GAME
This game is part of the series of sports game released by the 3M company during the 1960_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s and early 70_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  The series includes Football, Baseball, Hockey, Golf, Auto Racing, Horse Racing and Yacht Racing.  I have heard that they also produced a Basketball game but I have never come across one.  
These games all have the same basic format - a slender box containing the game components with a wrap-around vinyl playing board.  All of the games in this series feature high quality game parts.   The 3M catalog was later bought out by Avalon Hill who continued to produce most of the games in the standard AH bookshelf format until their demise in the mid 1990_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  
WIN, PLACE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;  SHOW series was 1st released by 3M in their standard vinyl covered long box format back in the 60_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s.  Avalon Hill reissued it a few times over the years.  It remained pretty much unchanged.  It is a very well thought out simulation of horse racing.  There were a number of companies that put out horse racing games that focused on betting.  This game has a betting aspect to it but you also spend your money as an owner trying to build up a great stock of horses.  This makes the game a lot more challenging than your typical horse racing game. 
The game parts are in NEAR MINT condition.  The game has been verified to be 100% complete with all the parts that were originally included in this edition of the game accounted for.  Overall I would grade the game parts 9 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).
The game box is in EXCELLENT-NEAR MINT condition.  Minimal shelf wear.  The snap on the wrap-around track is bent but intact and functional.   I would grade it a 8-9 on a 10 scale (see condition guide below).
CONDITION GUIDE: 
MINT (10):  I will only give this grade to brand new, unused items. NEAR MINT (9):  Shows virtually no use.  Seldom if ever played.   Perhaps some very light handling creases to the instructions or other minor flaws with the game parts.  Boxes will have only the slightest hint of shelf wear.   EXCELLENT (7-8): The game has seen some use but it was obviously well taken care of.  Game parts might have some light handling creases or other signs of careful use.  Board might have just a hint of rubbing or dented corners.  Boxes will have light rubbing to the artwork or perhaps some minor dishing.   VERY GOOD (5-6):  The game was not especially well cared for but it still has faired pretty well.  Game parts will show obvious use but nothing will be torn, badly stained or have any serious damage.  Box may have some rubbing, light staining, dishing, 1 or 2 neatly split corners, minor writing and/or a few pieces of tape.  No major structural damage and artwork will still be generally attractive.  GOOD (3-4): Obviously no care was taken with the game but it is still playable as is.  Game parts show considerable use but the game is complete with all parts in usable condition.  Box may have staining, writing, split corners, dishing and/or other structural damage but it will be intact and still usable.   POOR (1-2):  Only suitable to fill a space in your collection.  Game will be missing parts (these will be noted).  Box will have serious damage and may be missing aprons or badly torn.</notes>

    <notes>This is a very fun game , one that the whole family will enjoy. My family sure did. . There is  strategy involved when buying horses and again when placing your bets. You don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even have to bet on your own horse! The next step is the race- you maneuver your horse on the track; speeding ahead, trying to win the race (or maybe not-did you bet on him?)  This game is in excellent condition, considering it is 50 years old! The board is nice and big, so loots of people can play.</notes>

    <notes>This is a great horse racing game: fun and fast moving, easy enough for the whole family, yet full of challenge and just enough chance that no one gets too far ahead. Pick a horse, get ready, line up and they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re off! Did you bet on your horse, or did you bet on someone elses_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;? No one knows until the first horse crosses the finish line. This game is in great shape considering its nearly 50 years old!</notes>
