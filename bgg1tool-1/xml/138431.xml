   <description>Galaxy Defenders is a sci-fi cooperative, tactical battle game in which 1-5 players fight together against an oncoming alien menace. Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There is no _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Alien player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;recalibrates_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;alien signals_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Played once; excellent condition.  Contains the base game, plus many add-ons and KS promos (listing follows).  I am only asking for what I put into backing it.  Contains:
Galaxy Defenders Base Game
Rookie Agent Bundle
Elite Alien Army Expansion
Deck of Alien Cards (additional)
Set of 10 custom dice (additional)
Danger Cards
The Hunt (cards and figures) X3
Green Xeno Beast
Blue Xeno Beast
Red Xenobot Swarm
The War
Agent Chromium (alternate)
Total value, separately, is $251.  I am only asking $175.  The game is a bit heavy and large, but I will find the cheapest option available that is acceptable to you, if you wish.  If you want a quote for overseas shipping, please send $5 first.  Sorry to do that, but too many people are asking for overseas quotes and then not getting the games that it isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t worth my while without it.
From a smoke free home, well cared for.  Great game, but skirmish minis just isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t my style.  :)</notes>

    <notes>Did you miss the first Galaxy Defenders Kickstarter? Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t wait until the current campaign fulfills in Feb 2015 to get in on the action? You want a great price? You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in the right place.
This lot is for my original Galaxy Defenders pledge with all the promos and lots of add-ons. Everything is in hand and NIB! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll even ship it to you in the box they used to ship it all to me. And even better, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll sell it to you at the exact same price I bought it for--no Kickstarter scalping here! My goal is to recover my expense, not profit from you. (In fact, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;divestment_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; for me as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll have to cover the BGG and PayPal fees. Understandibly, the buyer will have to pay for shipping.)
Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s everything I have:
Galaxy Defenders Elite Agent pledge (inc. promos)
The Hive (3 red Xeno-Hunters and 3 red Xeno-Morphs)
Agent G-Droid
Agent Chromium (alternate)
Alien Huge Xeno-Morph Swarm (3 blue and 3 green Xeno-Morphs)
G-Dice set
Galaxy Ball card set
I elected to order these options because _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;The Hive_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Xeno-Morph Swarm_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; allow the playing of a downloadable campaign (and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m pretty sure they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t available after the campaign.)</notes>

    <notes>New in Shrink. 
I will also throw in the player boards for some of the original kickstarter stretch goals including agents P and S, agent Silver, Agent Iron, and the alternate agent chromium. This adds a ton of replay value as each agent plays differently. there are no miniatures for these cards included, but you can easily proxy with other miniatures such as heroclix or reaper.</notes>

    <notes>20170729: RESERVED for user 89P13.
Includes: EXTRA DICE PACK (unopened) and the ELITE ALIEN ARMY expansion.
- Completely sleeved in Ultra-Pros: except during unboxing, the cards have never been touched by human hands.
- Relatively few plays (6-8 sessions), so minimal wear on the boards and tokens. The map boards were (believe it or not), more often than not, kept under a transparent tablecloth during play.
- Box/book are in excellent condition - no notable wear on either.
- Pics or it didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t happen:
https://goo.gl/photos/1qaYNezrJJgrth1p7
- Reason for selling: far too fiddly and brain-burny for my tastes.
- Feel free to contact with questions or photo requests regarding specific components.</notes>

    <notes>Contains base game, both big box expansions (Operation Strikeback _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Extinction Protocol), the KS Top Secret Box and lots of KS extras... and more. 
I played the base game 3x, both expansions are unplayed. I just opened the boxes, punched out the markers and sleeved the cards. ALL cards are sleeved in FFG high quality sleeves and then stored in Ultra Pro deckboxes. Markers are in Plano boxes. Base set heroes and both sentry guns are painted semiprofessional (primer, coloring, wash and clearcoat) and look really good. I can send photos via mail if you like. Pack also contains all of the Earth Pledge extras from the second Kickstarter like two additional heroes, skills, devices, a master enemy, markers, etc. You can look up the details here: http://www.galaxy-defenders.com/kickstarter/GD_REWARD_SUMMARY.jpg I also started handicrafting the digitally released extra heroes from the first KS and finished the G-Droid. 3 others are half done (front and back side printed, front glued to cardboard and sealed with self-adhesive foil), everything to finish those 3 comes with this pack (including self-adhesive foil!). All other heroes and EVERYTHING digitally available (manuals, Android GD Tracker app APK, Mission Designer for Windows, FAQ/Errata, player aids, additional official missions, trap marker, etc.) I burned on a CD which also comes with this pack. I also got two exclusive cards as a bonus because two of the minis of another ARES KS were damaged, those cards are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Agent N_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Agent S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as enemies. Those are also in this pack. And I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll throw in a black cloth bag for drawing random markers.
This is a GIGANTIC pack, with 4 boxes (each as big as the base game box), so I will ONLY SHIP TO GERMANY! Pickup near Ingolstadt (Bavaria) can be arranged.  Shipping will be another 7,- €. 
Payment options: PayPal (F_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;F), Cash at pickup or bank transfer.
Feel free to ask any and all questions. I can take pictures of all the components and send them to you.</notes>

Galaxy Defenders (2014) with the Kickstarter _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Moon Level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pledge for Operation Strikeback and Extinction Protocol with the Classified Box of Kickstarter Exclusives. Also includes multiple sets of the custom action dice used in the game.
All of the campaigns were played through and as such the boxes have a little edge wear from transport. There is no writing in the campaign books and no damage to any of the miniatures, cards or tiles.
The pictures show the boxes with tiles and miniatures. A lot of the yellow (NPC/ally) miniatures came as Kickstarter exclusives but are not pictured with the Classified Box as they were used during the game and stored in the Operation Strikeback box.
There is a picture of the interior of the Galaxy Defenders 2014 box. This is indicative of the interior of all the boxes. The tokens are all bagged and everything else is stored in appropriate compartments. The only thing not stored in the game boxes is the clear plastic compartment box of game tokens. There is only room for it in the Classified Box and it is a little bit of a tight fit. I store it externally out of personal preference.
Here is a link to the detailed description of the contents under _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Moon Level_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;    https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1402889231/galaxy-defenders-the-earth-strikes-back-boardgame

    <notes>Kickstarter edition, from the first Kickstarter.  Includes all stretch goals and Alien Elite Army, as well as several optional buys (including extra Elite Predator and Alien figures, additional dice, etc) 
Does not include the optional Ball expansion. 
Box is beginning to separate at the bottom, which is extremely common from this set.  This can be repaired/stopped by taping it on the inside, which has not been done.  Includes several plano boxes to store minis and tokens, all cards sleeved in FFG sleeves, included.  
I also have a Kickstarter complete version of the Galaxy Defenders Expansions.  If both items are purchased together I will discount the total $25.  It will have to be shipped in separate boxes, however.   
Buyer to pay actual shipping in the US, to include insurance for final amount. Will not ship internationally based on weight. 
Local pickup in Lexington available, or Louisville/Cincy if patient 
Please GM me with any questions. 
All sales will go through BGG marketplace. Payment via paypal only</notes>

    <notes>Hallo Zusammen, 
löse ein Teil meiner Sammlung auf, die nicht auf den Tisch gekommen sind, oder nur ein mal versucht wurden und von meiner Spielgruppe nicht aufgenommen wurden. Sind meistens neu nur geöffnet oder einmal gespielt. Nichtraucher Haushalt und die Spiele wurden in einem Regal gehalten ohne Sonneneinstrahlung. Bin Sammler, darum immer mit Vorsicht behandelt. Schaut euch meine anderen Angebote an!
Versicherter Versand 6€, ab 100€ gebe ich gerne ein Rabatt, Verhandlungsbereit!
Nur Überweisung, Danke!
Zum Spiel: Hab mich mega drauf gefreut, in der Gruppe aufgebaut und nach 3 Zügen wieder abgebrochen, da die Gruppe nicht mehr wollte, Schade! Neuwertiger Zustand, keine Kratzer und Dellen.</notes>

    <notes>Retail version.  Tokens punched but game has never played.  All tokens sorted and separated into baggies or containers.  Map tiles are in excellent condition with no visible wear on sides or edges.  My games are very well taken care of and many have never been played.  Ships via UPS ground which estimates between approximately $10 and $20 depending on where you are in the continental U.S.  GeekMail for a quote if necessary.</notes>

    <notes>Big lot of Galaxy Defenders. Opened, punched, played, excellent condition. A few of the base game heroes and monsters are fully painted, and a few more heroes are primed (maybe 10-12 minis total). Includes:
Galaxy Defenders base game
Operation Strikeback expansion
Extinction Protocol expansion
5th Column expansion
Everything is integrated into the 2 large expansion boxes. I can include the base game box as well, but it will raise the shipping price.</notes>
