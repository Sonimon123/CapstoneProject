   <description>An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.  It could even play recognizable pieces of music at significant points during the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

You know the game.
classic 80_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s rare MB game - Dark Tower
send your noble around the kingdom to collect the 3 keys; enabling you to enter the Dark Tower for the final confrontation.
Game in very good condition. One piece missing - one of the player pawns, altho i beleive these are relatively easy to locate. Weve just been using a pawn from another game as it in no way alters the gameplay.
Board in good condition, as are all of the other playing pieces.
Included are the plastic, card peg holders, which not all versions seem to have.
The box has seen better days but is still in useable condition, just taped up where needed.
Ivev marked this as Very Good even tho one piece is missing because aside from that it is in very good condition.
Manual and rules are of course included.
Any questions, please mail me</notes>

    <notes>Tower works great and was recently overhauled by a friend of mine whose business is in electronics. Box is a little torn and the game is missing a couple minor pieces, but nothing that prevents the playing or enjoyment of the game. Rules are in good shape. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d love to keep this game, but, like others I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to sell today, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d love to get an Ipad more... Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete except that one 1 Pegasus token is missing.  I tested the tower on May 26, 2011 and it was properly working.  The box has pretty crisp coloring with some edgewear and one corner of the box top is split.  Box bottom is fine.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen a couple pretty beat up boxes for this game over the years and this one is in pretty good shape (the Dark Tower game box is problematic as the tower does not fit in the box so that you can actually close the box properly).
Shipping will be $15 to Eastern and Central US and $19 to Mountain and Pacific (the high cost is due to the size of the box and the need to pack the tower separately as well).  Other locations please inquire.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete and all components are in good condition. The Tower works and the extra light bulb is still in plastic. The box is intact, but the insert is a little beat up; not surprising for a 34 year-old game.
Please make any requests for additional information about the item prior to purchasing.
