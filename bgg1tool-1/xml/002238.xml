    <notes>Condition of Panzerblitz:
--Overall condition: Very good
--Complete
--Counters: Punched. No wear
--Rulebook, Scenarios: Very good condition, but fading (age?)
--Maps: Very good condition
--Box: Shelfwear, but intact corners
--Summary: I punched it, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think I ever played it, and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been in storage ever since.
The price is somewhat flexible, so feel free to make me an offer.
Shipping to the USA will be $10. Shipping for multiple items will be combined. Please contact me for worldwide shipping cost. I have little feedback here, but please see my ebay feedback for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;weadockfamily_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; if you are concerned.</notes>

Rules: rules of play pamphlet good condition, campaign analysis 24 pages good condition
Charts: 1 quick reference combat/terrain chart good condition, 6 scenario cards each with 2 scenarios 1-12, examples of play card all in good condition
Dice: 1D6
Counters: 352 punched and checked counters bagged all in good condition.  There are two counters missing one german wreck and one panzer IV (there are another 13 and 11 respectively of in the counter mix), so this would have minimal impact on the game.  I have however made up replacements for both counters that are full colour copies mounted on the same weight card.
Weight: 1000g 
Also included a huge number of general articles on the game and a copy (scan) of the panzerblitz players guide.</notes>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage: £5.50
European Postage: £9.00
Rest of World Postage: £17.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible. Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually. This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS:
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment.

PAYMENT METHODS:
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months! There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).

This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.

The counters are unpunched except for two fortifications, which are unfortunately missing. The game is otherwise complete except for one board clip. The counters, scenario cards (all still attached except for one), and boards are in excellent condition. The rules and designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s notes/campaign analysis show signs of handling.

    <notes>Game is in Acceptable shape.
  
Missing two counters: 
1-JgdPz VI (of 1)
1-PzKpfw (of 13)
Everything else is there and in good shape. 
Rulebook has a number of underlined sentences and is a bit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;bent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; (no creasing and essentially lays flat.  It is perfectly readable.  All other supplies are good including the  mapboard, which are excellent.
Box bottom has one split corner, top has no split corners but two tears of the paper on the bottom and top edges.  Overall box is a bit sun faded and has shelf-wear, but no caving or creasing.
This game is nearly perfectly playable except for the two missing counters, though I think proxies could easily be used. 
If this was a slipcase version there is no longer a slipcase.
I am always open to trade or negotiate.</notes>

    <notes>Extra Counters _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Scenarios for Avalon Hill’s Panzerblitz
Available is a new complete set of Avalon Hill Panzerblitz variant counters. These include the article, counters and scenarios in the General Vol. 28 #3; the article, counters and scenarios for Panzerblitz 1941, the article and scenarios for “The Forgotten Year” (1942) and Situations 14-25. 
These are new style counters, printed on cardboard, laminated with a protective plastic covering and hand cut. These are original-look counters. The graphics have been improved and enlarged so they are bold and crisp.
The scenarios are printed on beige cardstock and look almost identical to the originals.
Shipping will be $6.00 to Canada or $8.00 to the United States, by standard air mail letter. Expedited (4-day service,) tracked and insured is about $22.00 to the U.S., less to Canada. I will attempt to combine shipping on multiple orders whenever possible.

Take advantage of my shelf-space woes! When you buy more than one game, pay full price for your highest priced item, but get 20% off of each additional item.
US buyers - please note: shipping to the US is very expensive. To ship a Days of Wonder shaped box runs approximately $25, if not more. </notes>

    <notes>Bought used and never played. 
3 Maps, 2 booklets, and (unseparated) scenario cards all very good shape - clean, unmarked, and apparently rarely used.
Counters are punched, but so obsessively bagged by formation and type that I cannot imagine any are missing.
Box has corners ripped, and box scuffed up. Funtional, but not nice.
BONUS: This copy also includes components from the subsequent Arab-Isaraeli Wars - Rulebook, chart folio, and 4 maps. No counters, charts, or box though.
Happy to answer further enquiries, and will combine shipping on multiple items.</notes>
