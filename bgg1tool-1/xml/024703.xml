   <description>Heroscape Marvel: The Conflict Begins features plastic figures of Marvel Universe heroes and villains - each with a card to control movement and combat strength.  Marvel HeroScape is part of the HeroScape series of games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players can build many different battlefields by attaching and stacking terrain tiles of different sizes. The battlefield/scenario section includes 8 scenarios and 2 terrain layouts. Games can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version. In the basic version, designed for younger players, characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each unit has a movement rating in hexes. Combat is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card. Extra hits count as wounds (figures may have more than one wound)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The master game uses a system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;pre-fab_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; army to the battle in order to save time._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Weight: 1.120 kg
New -- mint condition -- unopened -- still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Marvel Heroscape features plastic figures of Marvel Universe heroes and villains - each with a card to control movement and combat strength. Marvel HeroScape is part of the HeroScape series of games. Players can build many different battlefields by attaching and stacking terrain tiles of different sizes. The battlefield/scenario section includes 8 scenarios and 2 terrain layouts. Games can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns. The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version. In the basic version, designed for younger players, characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions. Each unit has a movement rating in hexes. Combat is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s card. Extra hits count as wounds (figures may have more than one wound). The master game uses a system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s possible to bring a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;pre-fab_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; army to the battle in order to save time.

If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.

Standard Information listed on all my For Sale Games:
------------------------------------------------------
1) Shipping cost is the highest cost of all games purchased + the add on cost of each other game. Promo cards or anything else that fits in a bubble mailer will have a base cost of $5 and and an add on cost of $1, a small game has a base cost of $8 and an add on cost of $2, a medium game has a base cost of $14 and an add on cost of $3 and a large game has a base cost of $20 and add on cost of $4. Anything outside that range will be listed specifically. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re providing a business address to ship to, take a $1 off the shipping. 
2) Purchase a $100 or more worth of games and get 5% off your total order.
3) Purchase $200 or more and get 5% off and free shipping.
4) If you see any games on my for trade list that aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t up for sale, feel free to ask me to add to the market.
5) Most conditions are listed as very good, all those items listed as such range from very good to like new. 
6) Amazon and game store gift cards are usually accepted but please check with me first if that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an option you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to pursue.
7) I try to list editions but if an edition isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t listed and it matters to you, please ask! If an item is bought and another edition was expected but you didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask, then I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to refund but I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t cover either shipping charge.</notes>

    <notes>The box is pretty scuffed up, but the game components and rules are all in good condition.
Additionally, includes (12) custom heroes from X-Men/Marvel/DC: Superman, Batman, Robin, Flash, Thor, Green Lantern, Catwoman, Prof. X, Magneto, Storm, Wolverine, Rogue. The hero cards are color printed and hand cut from cardstock. The designs are from heroscapers.com (the C3G I believe) and are supposedly play-tested and balanced (whatever that means with superheroes). The custom hero minis are a mix of heroclix and whatever else that was inexpensive at the time but looked good.
Buyer pays actual shipping from 30269 or $20, whichever is less.</notes>
