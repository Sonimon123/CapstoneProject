   <description>The clever little game Code 777 combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; which should help the others' determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Code 777 was explicitly inspired by What's That on My Head?, and Alex Randolph credited Robert Abbott with co-designing this game based on that inspiration._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2010, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, adding both a fifth player to the game and symbols to make it colorblind-friendly. In 2015, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 30th Anniversary Limited Edition, which is the final edition from Stronghold Games._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>this is the Jumbo edition of CODE 777. Multilanguage, rules and question cards are available in english, german, french, dutch.... Box is in OK shape, one side has been partially torn and now has some tape on it, otherwise no problem with the box. Barely noticeable, as the content is in VERY GOOD shape. Barely used as the notepad still has almost all its sheets of paper to write down your hints. One rack (to hold the tiles) was missing and I replaced it with another one of similar shape a carpenter espeially made for me. As this game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t very heavy, it can ship for less than $10 regular airmail anywhere in the world. Very hard to find game</notes>

    <notes>great opportunity to buy this jewel, in EXCELLENT condition, inside is as good as new, with the notepad barely used. Box has real minor wears due to normal storage condition. Very hard to find, especially in such a good condition. This is the international multilanguage edition, with all you ned to play in french german or english (and more languages)... rules, cards etc. No translation required! Since the game isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;#039;t very heavy, I can ship it regular airmail for just $10, anywhere in the world.</notes>

    <notes>Guess the game deserves a better rating than acceptable, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want anybody to be disappointed especially with a quite expensive game.
Just a little bit of shelfwear on the box, but no actual damage (no split corners etc.). Box looks a bit _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;dirty_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; inside. Rules are photocopies. One card has a little scratch on the back as if it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t punched correctly.
Otherwise everything there and nice condition. Looking at the sheets the game hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played much.
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.30€ worldwide and 8.20€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.</notes>

    <notes>... this is the original multi-language edition by Jumbo from 1985 and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in TOP condition (personally I would rate it as like new!)
Rules and game material are in: english, french, german, dutch, dansk and swedish.
As said before, the game is in perfect shape, complete (of course!) with only very very very minimal signs of wear (on the box only)! The notepads / block of note sheets is nearly full - so I really doubt that this game has been played more than once!
Shipping worlwide at cost!

    <notes>The box has very minimal shelfwear. The components are all in great shape. Age is the only thing going against this game physically. It is a great deduction game.
Buyer to pay actual USPS Priority shipping. Personal checks must clear prior to shipping.
Thanks!</notes>

Shipping costs shown are for an individual game. I will combine shipping as best I can. Large packages (5kg, say 6 games) are very cost-effective to ship internationally via DHL. Ask if you want a detailed price.

    <notes>This is the Chieftain edition, called Code 7. It is essentially identical to the Jumbo edition - the racks are different, but everything else is the same. The rules and cards are in English and French.
The game is complete and in very good condition overall. The tiles do show very slight wear, but are not distinguishable from the back except for one which has an extremely small ink mark. This will not be a problem for many people, and if it is you can simply draw the tiles from a bag (having an opponent place them). The box has a little wear.</notes>

The classic code-cracking game is back in a 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition!
Crack your code first! You can see your opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; codes but not your own. Using questions and logic, try to deduce which three numbers are hidden in front of you. Once you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re reasonably sure, then you can take a guess. But if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles...
This 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of Code 777 has been expanded to allow for up to 5 players (from the previous 4 player editions). All of the components have been upgraded to the highest-quality levels. And our Code 777 is also the first edition to be colorblind friendly! Stronghold Games is proud to bring this great deduction game back into print by popular demand after being unavailable for over 10 years worldwide.</notes>
