   <description>Middle-Earth Quest takes place approximately ten years after Bilbo Baggins leaves the Shire, and several years before Frodo leaves Bag End on his journey leading to the destruction of the One Ring. Thus, Middle Earth Quest will take place in a time of growing darkness.  Players will take control of characters such as a Gondorian Captain, a Rider from the Westfold, or numerous other character types. Not only will characters be able to experience new adventure in Middle Earth, but we will carefully seek to tie in the experience with the massive amounts of lore and story that takes place around the edges of the central THE LORD OF THE RINGS storyline._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Middle-Earth Quest is a game of adventure and conflict set in the time leading up to the creation of the Fellowship. One player will adopt the mantle of Sauron and do his best to spread his evil influence across the lands. Up to three players become heroes and will do their best to foil Sauron's foul plots, and rally the peoples of Middle-earth to their side._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG LTR11)
It is a time of growing darkness and despair. Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord of Mordor, has returned to his ancient fastness of Barad-dûr. From there, his evil and corruption has spread across the lands once more. Alas, in the West, there is little strength left. The Elves have all but abandoned Middle-earth, and the blood of Númenór has run thin; that which remains now dwells in Minas Tirith, or with the lonely rangers that haunt the ruins and wild country of Arnor.
Yet, there is still hope. Gandalf the Grey has learned that the One Ring, the master-ring which Sauron desires and fears above all, is with the hobbit Frodo in the Shire. And there are heroes! Heroes to aid Gandalf in his hunt for the creature Gollum, and in his quest for the lost knowledge of Isildur’s Bane. Heroes, whose strong arms guard the Shire from the enemy. Heroes, who venture into the forests of Ithilien, or even into the Land of Shadow itself, there to disrupt the schemes of Sauron, wherever they may be found.
Middle-earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo’s birthday party and the Ring’s departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel The Lord of the Rings.
One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf’s plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge.
Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as a hero and stand against the Dark Lord?
The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands!
Middle-earth Quest contains:
•1 Rulebook
•1 Large Game Board (in two parts) 28.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 41_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; when put together
•5 Plastic Hero Figures
•5 Plastic Minion Figures
•Over 225 tokens
•More than 470 cards
•5 Hero Sheets and 8 Plastic Stands

Duration: 3 to 4 hour

Theme: Middle-earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo’s birthday party and the Ring’s departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel The Lord of the Rings. One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf’s plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge. Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as a hero and stand against the Dark Lord? The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands!

I prefer paypal payments but I also accept money orders. I will ship once I receive payment. This game will ship either UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion. Although I pack my games well, I cannot be responsible for any damage caused during shipping. Insurance is available to buyers at cost.

Will send with two sets of minis: I originally got a batch of the bad brittle ones which have been inexpertly painted and, in some cases, repaired by me (see my personal gallery), but have since also acquired a replacement set.  Please note that even in the replacement _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;non brittle_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; set, Gothmog_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s axe head has snapped off!  Otherwise the replacements are okay.
As an extra incentive, I will pay parcel postage to a UK address so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s £45 inclusive of delivery.
Will only ship to the UK.</notes>

    <notes>Played through twice, gently, by adults.  Everything is present and in great shape, except that one of the minis is broken into about four pieces (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the one of a warrior on a horse).  It is possibly fixable by someone who knows about minis, but alas I do not.  
This is a big game!  Shipping is $14.

    <notes>This is one of the early print versions that has the miniatures made out of a brittle plastic which resulted in some defects in a couple of minis. Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t effect game play and FFG would probably replace them if I felt like pestering them. Everything is neatly bagged,organized and accounted for. Fun game, just no one to play it with.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink.
I use priority mail regional rate and USPS Parcel Select to keep shipping costs as low as possible. This is heavy, though, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not gonna be SUPER cheap if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re West Coast livin_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
*MUST READ* PAYMENT INFO:
I accept USPS Money Orders or well-concealed cash.
I accept Paypal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Goods Purchase_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; payments, but your grand total will suffice to make me _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;whole_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; after Paypal takes their fees out, which are $0.30 + 2.9% of the transferred amount. So around $2 extra here, depending on shipping.
I also accept ZERO-FEE _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; PAYPAL payments that use a bank account or your existing Paypal balance as the payment source (NOT a credit card, unless you pick the option to pay the fees yourselves) for the exact sale price plus exact postage.
To make a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Personal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Paypal payment, you: Log in to your Paypal account, click _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Send Money_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, then choose the option of send money to friends and family, NOT to purchase goods. Make sure your source of funds is either your bank account or your paypal account balance. (If you use a credit card, you must select the option to pay the fees.)</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFGLTR11)
It is a time of growing darkness and despair. Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord of Mordor, has returned to his ancient fastness of Barad-dûr. From there, his evil and corruption has spread across the lands once more. Alas, in the West, there is little strength left. The Elves have all but abandoned Middle-earth, and the blood of Númenór has run thin; that which remains now dwells in Minas Tirith, or with the lonely rangers that haunt the ruins and wild country of Arnor. Yet, there is still hope. Gandalf the Grey has learned that the One Ring, the master-ring which Sauron desires and fears above all, is with the hobbit Frodo in the Shire. And there are heroes! Heroes to aid Gandalf in his hunt for the creature Gollum, and in his quest for the lost knowledge of Isildur_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Bane. Heroes, whose strong arms guard the Shire from the enemy. Heroes, who venture into the forests of Ithilien, or even into the Land of Shadow itself, there to disrupt the schemes of Sauron, wherever they may be found. Middle-earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s birthday party and the Ring_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R. Tolkien_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s novel The Lord of the Rings. One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge. Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as a hero and stand against the Dark Lord? The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands! </notes>

    <notes>Description: 
It is a time of growing darkness and despair. Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord of Mordor, has returned to his ancient fastness of Barad-dûr. From there, his evil and corruption has spread across the lands once more. Alas, in the West, there is little strength left. The Elves have all but abandoned Middle-earth, and the blood of Númenór has run thin; that which remains now dwells in Minas Tirith, or with the lonely rangers that haunt the ruins and wild country of Arnor.
 
Yet, there is still hope. Gandalf the Grey has learned that the One Ring, the master–ring which Sauron desires and fears above all, is with the hobbit Frodo in the Shire. And there are heroes! Heroes to aid Gandalf in his hunt for the creature Gollum, and in his quest for the lost knowledge of Isildur’s Bane. Heroes, whose strong arms guard the Shire from the enemy. Heroes, who venture into the forests of Ithilien, or even into the Land of Shadow itself, there to disrupt the schemes of Sauron, wherever they may be found.
Middle-earth Quest is set in the seventeen-year period between Bilbo’s birthday party and the Ring’s departure from the Shire, as described in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel The Lord of the Rings.
One player takes the role of Sauron, who is attempting to dominate Middle-earth with his nefarious plots and evil minions. Up to three other players take the roles of heroes who must hold the darkness at bay until Gandalf’s plans have matured. To do so, the heroes must embark on dangerous quests and consult with the famous characters of Middle-earth to gain favor and knowledge.
Will you play as Sauron and claim Middle-earth as your own? Or will you play as a hero and stand against the Dark Lord?
The fate of Middle-earth rests in your hands!

    <notes>Punched, and walked through once. Components are in great condition, box has a little wear from moving. No manual, took it out to read and can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find it. I can possibly print one, but Fantasy Flight has archived PDFs of all manuals on their website if you would prefer to save some trees.
Shipping is from Burbank (91504) or can arrange for local pickup if you live around Los Angeles. As an estimate, shipping from Burbank to New York City was just over $16 (big, heavy box). No packaging/handling fees. Will combine with my other game sales for better deal on shipping.
Feel free to send any questions. Cheers!</notes>

    <notes>Thank you for checking out my listing. 
Game is Unpunched/unplayed. It is listed as like new because of this. However, the game box has some noticeable (pretty minor) damage incurred during a move.  One corner got dinged and was split. The split corner can be repaired using the online tutorial on how to repair game box corners but I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t taken the time to do it. 
Outside of that minor blemish, even the box looks pretty immaculate and as stated above, all game parts are still in as amazing of shape as they were when the shrinkwrap was removed!
***I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve seen this game sell for some crazy prices recently now that it is out-of-print. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to price this so that someone who wants to actually play the game will be able to afford it instead of having to pay _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;collector prices_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for something that will get worn out with plays.   If you are someone who intends to play this, I believe you will be extremely happy with the condition of this copy!***

Game is opened but has never been played.  Cards are still brand new in shrink wrap while components are inventoried, sorted into baggies and in like NEW condition.
Box has the normal minor shelf wear for its age but is still in great shape and completely structurally sound.

    <notes>I purchased this game to give to a good friend of mine as a gift only to find out that he just recently acquired a copy. Now it is time to try and recoup most of my expense in acquiring it by putting it up for sale here!
Game is in like NEW condition and never played! Shrink wrap removed only to inventory the components and sort them appropriately. 
The box is really in EXCELLENT overall shape with only some minor shelf wear and is very much structurally sound.

    <notes>ONLY REASON IT_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;S VERY GOOD AND NOT LIKE NEW: I found a new copy and it was in great condition except that one corner had a clean break going down half way.  The box is still solid and is easily fixable.
Tried to play once and found it physically too large for our play space, and the rules dense enough that I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see myself taking the time to learn and then teach it sadly.</notes>

    <notes>Minor cosmetic damage to the box only. This has never been played. The tokens were punched and bagged but the cards are still in their original shrink. The game boards have their original bag and the game as a whole has its original insert. See the pictures below. Shipping is $15.00.</notes>

    <notes>Excellent shape - I do not recall ever playing a full game.  My group does not play long board games, even if they are excellent games.  The cards have been sorted and bagged in separate decks.  Tokens/figures are sorted and marked, and are stored in a separate plastic storage case(very convenient), which will be included with the game.  Pictures available upon request.  Buyer pays all shipping costs.</notes>

This game is in great condition overall but there are a couple issues which I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be completely honest about. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like pictures for more information don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask.
All components are bagged and labelled. Includes a fan made expansion, The Unfinished Tales, in other words added cards for the expansion. The Ringwraiths are missing a couple swords and Gothmog_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s ax head is broken but the other 8 miniatures are intact.  There is a crack in the board seam  at the top left. One box edge is cracked.
Smoke and pet free. Please contact me about shipping. Thanks for looking and see if you would like other games I have available to save on shipping.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and punched but never played - I inverted the box insert, which allows more space for storage, but it can probably be reverted to the way it was originally. Everything is complete and there are actually a few spare figures/miniatures - a couple of mine were originally broken but FFG sent a complete replacement set.
From a smoke and pet-free home - will be carefully packed.
Quite heavy so probably UK shipping only.</notes>

    <notes>Condition: Good (played once, everything bagged and complete)
Language/Edition: English, 2009
Publisher: Fantasy Flight
Components are shiny and new without scuffs or defects on cards/minis/tokens/book. They would easily qualify as very good. However, the box has stress marks on the four corners due to moving the game from one shelf/box to another. I have the insert, but folded it to the bottom of the box, since the false bottom made it unstable. 
Great game, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the proper group to get it to the table. Only played once. 
The shipping might be expensive, since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a large box. Feel free to email an address and I can verify shipping costs before I send it out.</notes>

USPS Regional Rate (If your order fits the standardized box)

Also  mentioning that there is 3 complete set_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s of mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s in the box.  The original buyer had a problem with some of the original mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s so FFG sent him two replacement sets.
(the game is heavy, so expect some shipping costs - let me know your zipcode and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send an estimate).</notes>

    <notes>The box is a bit warped but in fairly good condition. The contents are in excellent condition.
I have two copies of the game - on of them has painted minis which I will include for an additional 15€.  Otherwise I will include the unpainted ones.
If you can pay by IBAN I prefer that. Otherwise paypal also works but I would ask for an additional 3% to cover the fees.</notes>

    <notes>Up for sale is my copy of Middle Earth Quest. Played a couple of times, and in excellent shape. I am the original owner, and I have an extra set of Hero cards (still in shrink) included in the box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to downsize my collection, so that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the only reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m putting up Middle Earth Quest for sale.
All of the 5 Heroes (Thalin, Eometh, Beravor, Argalad, and Eleanor) as well as all 6 of the Sauron minions ( The Black Serpent, The Mouth of Sauron, Gothmog of Gorgoroth, The Ringwraiths, and the Witch King) have all been painted to a very high, professional degree. Pictures are available upon request.
This is a large box game, so shipping will be a little more expensive. I will not ship outside North America.
Shipping to Canada will be $25, and to the US $35.</notes>

    <notes>Bought new in shrink (yes I did) and fully sleeved it and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s never been played. Time to make room for some new games and get this classic for a steal. It has a spare set of miniatures (in varying degrees of condition mostly good though). Sleeves are included! The box for this rather old game was slightly damaged while it was still in shrink. One of the corners had begun separating on the inner box and there is some damage on the outer box corresponding to the same corner. You can see from the photos what the condition is. The components were NEVER USED! The decks of cards were still in shrink and went straight into sleeves. 
So to be clear: The components of this are in literally new condition aside from being punched (and bagged) and cards taken from the cellophane and put directly into sleeves. Only the box has minor damage AND there is a spare set of miniatures to boot!
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game will not fit into a FlatRate box so expect shipping to be slightly higher. The box it would ship in is 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 18_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and weighs 9.5 pounds packed. All game box sides are covered in two layers of bubble-wrap and the rest of the box space is filled by firmly packed peanuts.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:

    <notes>Box is in good condition with shelf wear at the corners/edges. Components are in excellent condition (played ~5 times) with the exception of poor Gothmog_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s battle axe, which arrived snapped off. The axe head itself is bagged separately and included; I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve just never bothered to glue it back together.

    <notes>This is a GREAT out of print game that brings Middle Earth to life! Note, the miniatures in the game had separated from their bases in original shipping, but a quick dab of crazyglue got them back into place years ago, and it was never a problem again. This game provides a unique Middle Earth in the time BEFORE the LOTR classic!
Shipping is within 24 hours of payment, and typically $11-$18 domestically, with global being dependent on the country
We do accept FB messenger payments, which are instant and free, and preferable to PayPal. 
Please give this game a good home, and please see what other items we have for sale, as we can bundle shipping for reductions on multiple items.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Middle-Earth Quest has been played twice, and all the components are accounted for and in excellent condition. The box is the exception; one of the corners got a bit squished at one point (see pictures), and there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little bit of wear and deformity around it, and the edges of the top of the box have just a tiny bit of white scuffing. The rulebox is included, and in excellent condition.</notes>
