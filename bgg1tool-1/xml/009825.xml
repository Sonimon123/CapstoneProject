The all-new TimeLine begins just before the American Revolution in 1770 and continues through the Civil War, stopping at 1916.

The Card Game of 19th Century Time Travel
 
EAC is a stand-alone expansion for Chrononauts - the card game of time travel.
What would have happened if the Boston Tea Party had been prevented, or if Paul Revere_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s midnight riders had been silenced? What if the USA had failed to purchase Louisiana, or if Washington DC hadn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been burned by the British? What if the Battle of New Orleans had been called off, or if the Alamo had been abandoned and razed before the Mexican army surrounded it? What if Maryland had joined the Confederacy... would the South have won the Civil War? All of these questions and many more will be answered when you play Early American Chrononauts!</notes>

    <notes>I’ve never had a chance to play this version, though we’ve played and enjoyed the regular Chrononauts, but I just can’t keep them all.  It’s in very good condition, with the box having minor corner wear.  I’ll charge $8 for shipping within the continental U.S., and shipping cost plus $2 outside the U.S..
I’m selling off most of my games.  If you want a list of all I have for sale, just click on my name (Seller: Too Many Games).
If you want to buy more than one item, I’ll charge the actual shipping cost plus $2 (to cover costs of the packaging etc.).</notes>
