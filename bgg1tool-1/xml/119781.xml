   <description>Legacy: Gears of Time is a strategic card game, mechanically rooted in its time travel theme. Players each play cards from their own hand, draw from a central draw pile, move and play technologies on a single timeline, while placing their influence cubes on existing technologies._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Legacy is played on a timeline that grows at the end of each of 4 rounds. Players take turns during a round consisting of 3 actions each. During each turn, you may travel back in time, play a technology card from your hand, influence an existing technology, or draw two cards (keeping only one)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As you travel back in time, Technologies are played from your hand by paying their discard cost. Any technologies you play generate influence for you automatically._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Having more influence than your opponents is the key to claiming rewards for a technology! At the end of each round, rewards are given for each technology and its dependencies. One Influence cube from each technology will come off at the end of each round, forming your influence pool to be used in future rounds to influence existing technologies. Keep in mind, a technology is only considered successful if all of its dependencies exist previously on the timeline._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Since there are several copies of each technology, you may be able to preempt and eliminate an existing copy by playing yours earlier in the timeline!  Be sure there is room for your new technology, though; each time-frame has a capacity equal to it's distance from the present._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;There are also a few rare but powerful Fate cards, each allowing you to break the rules in interesting ways. Fate cards have no discard cost and don't require an action to be played._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;By strategically influencing existing technologies, adapting to your opponents actions, and carefully choosing when to go further back in time, you will find yourself victorious over your rivals! History remains intact until the Ancient Machine demands you return to the past to rebuild history, and your Legacy, once more._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Summary:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     4 Rounds_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     4 Turns per Round_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     3 Actions per Turn (any mix of the following):_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         Travel back in Time_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         Play a Technology card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         Influence an existing Technology_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;         Draw two cards (keep one)_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

In the world of Legacy: Gears of Time, the course of history is maintained by the operators of the Ancient Machine. As an Antiquitect, the machine binds you to the present while you travel back through time. Charged with influencing the activities of the past, you are resolute in ensuring that the technological advancement of the world remains intact. Excellent planning, adaptability and influence are key to returning to the present with the greatest Legacy, claiming victory over your rivals! Legacy is a strategic card game mechanically rooted in its time travel theme. Players navigate the timeline, establishing and influencing technologies, to ensure increasingly elaborate technology chains remain intact. At the end of each round players score Legacy points for having the most influence over a technology, and for each time a more advanced technologies depends on it; the highest scoring player at the end of the game is the winner! </notes>

    <notes>Floodgate Games (FGGLGT02)
 In the world of Legacy: Gears of Time, the course of history is maintained by the operators of the Ancient Machine. As an Antiquitect, the machine binds you to the present while you travel back through time. Charged with influencing the activities of the past, you are resolute in ensuring that the technological advancement of the world remains intact. Excellent planning, adaptability and influence are key to returning to the present with the greatest Legacy, claiming victory over your rivals! Legacy is a strategic card game mechanically rooted in its time travel theme. Players navigate the timeline, establishing and influencing technologies, to ensure increasingly elaborate technology chains remain intact. At the end of each round players score Legacy points for having the most influence over a technology, and for each time a more advanced technologies depends on it; the highest scoring player at the end of the game is the winner!

    <notes>Opened but un-played and un-punched. This also includes many extras including the Expansion _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Forbidden Machines_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Forbidden Machine Foil Promo Cards and two packs of Forbidden Machine Card Sleeves (un-opened). The box for the expansion is NOT included.
Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags.  I ship via USPS, which is most cost effective. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. Shipping from 98012.
Here’s some shipping ESTIMATES to help you get an idea of what it will cost. Your distance from my Zip Code (98012) and box weight are the biggest factors in price. Please ask ahead of time if you want to know your shipping! If you place an order and cancel it after I provide you with shipping, you will get negative feedback. 
Small Card Game (i.e. 6 nimmt or Hanabi) $3-$6  / USPS First Class or Priority Bubble Mailer 
Thin Medium Sized  (i.e. Concept, Las Vegas) $8-$10 / Priority Mail
Thick Medium Sized (i.e. Istanbul, King of Tokyo, Russian Railroads) $10-$13 / Priority Mail
Big Box Games (i.e. Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders) $16-$18 / Priority Mail or Parcel Post
Oversized or Odd Shaped Boxes ($22-$25) / Parcel Post</notes>

Photos available upon request.
Buyer pays shipping using whichever service they would prefer. I am in Chicago, IL (Zip Code 60625) if you would like to estimate what the shipping costs would be. I am not a store! I do not have shipping rates at my fingertips so it takes me exactly as much time as it would take you to figure out how much it would cost to ship using whichever service you prefer. The game weighs approximately 3 pounds so figure an extra pound or so of packing material.
I have several items for sale at the moment. Discounts on both the games and shipping if you purchase multiple items! See my listings here:
