   <description>DungeonQuest is a re-imagining of the classic board game of dungeon exploration for 1-4 players. Set in the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth (first popularized by Runebound), DungeonQuest retains the peril, tension, and brutality of the beloved original game while updating both mechanical and thematic elements. Players take on the roles of courageous (or foolish) heroes willing to brave the legendary dangers of Dragonfire Dungeon. Fortune awaits those able to venture into the dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s lair..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Legends say that the doors of Dragonfire Dungeon open every sunrise, welcoming brave adventurers into its depths. But once the sun sets, the doors close and seal the fates of those who lingered too long. Only a few have ever returned from Dragonfire Dungeon, and those who have usually come back near death. But they return as heroes nonetheless._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, DungeonQuest is unique in that the dungeon essentially runs itself. No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time. Additionally, DungeonQuest also includes rules for solo play, so you can even challenge Kalladra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s keep on your own!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Great riches and everlasting glory await if you can survive Dragonfire Dungeon. The Dragonlord Kalladra has challenged all heroes of Terrinoth to test themselves against the most dangerous dungeon in all the realms._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dare you face the dragon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s challenge?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Game has not been played.  It is brand new, unpunched and without wear, except that the cards which aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t used in DungeonQuest (the bonus cards for Runebound, Descent, and RuneWars) have been removed along with the one counter (Brightblaze) for Descent.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount. DungeonQuest does fit in a fixed rate priority mail box, so shipping within the US will be at most $10.50.</notes>

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG VA72)
DungeonQuest is a re-imagining of the classic board game of dungeon exploration for 1-4 players. Set in the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth (first popularized by Runebound), DungeonQuest retains the peril, tension, and brutality of the beloved original game while updating both mechanical and thematic elements. Players take on the roles of brave (or foolish) heroes willing to brave the legendary dangers of Dragonfire Dungeon. Fortune awaits those able to venture into the dragon’s lair...
In DungeonQuest, Players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragon Lord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...</notes>

    <notes>Trying to clear up some space on my gaming shelf. Game is complete with some minor concerns. There is a split in one corner of the box, which I have patched with tape. The 6 figures have primer on them as the original owner was going to paint them but never got around to doing so. Other than that the game is in excellent shape. Game ships priority mail $11.35. Game ships as soon as payment clears.

    <notes>Description:  
Legends say that the doors of Dragonfire Dungeon open every sunrise, welcoming brave adventurers into its depths. But once the sun sets, the doors close and seal the fates of those who lingered too long. Only a few have ever returned from Dragonfire Dungeon, and those who have usually come back near death. But they return as heroes nonetheless.
In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...
While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, Dungeonquest is unique in that the dungeon essentially runs itself. No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time. Additionally, DungeonQuest also includes rules for solo play, so you can even challenge Kalladra’s keep on your own!
Great riches and everlasting glory await if you can survive Dragonfire Dungeon. The Dragonlord Kalladra has challenged all heroes of Terrinoth to test themselves against the most dangerous dungeon in all the realms.
Dare you face the dragon’s challenge?

Game is in very good condition and has been verified as complete including original instructions (not shown in the picture but they are present). All cards are in great condition! Also comes with the Runebound _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Descent pieces which originally came with DungeonQuest! Box has light shelf wear but overall the box is in very good condition. There is no cardboard box insert (assuming it ever came with one originally)</notes>

    <notes> This copy of DungeonQuest is opened, but unpunched and never played.
It does not contain the miniatures.
The game originally came with promo cards for use in other Fantasy Flight Games - Runebound, Descent, and RuneWars.  These promo items are not present either.  One promo counter, used in the Descent boardgame, has been punched from the sheets and is not present.
The game is 100% playable without the miniatures, as there is an additional token for each player that can be used in their place.
Apart from the missing miniatures and promo items, this game is in 100% mint condition.
$10 shipping anywhere in the US.  Contact for international shipping.</notes>

    <notes>NOT COMPLETE
IMPORTANT: This edition of DungeonQuest came with hero cards for Runebound/Descent. I traded those cards away along with the minis. While the game is still very playable, it does NOT include the minis any more and you will have to use substitutes. If you buy this, please acknowledge that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve read this note.
Cards are unused, tokens are unpunched, Runebound/Descent hero cards and minis are NOT included.</notes>

    <notes>Game is complete.
The miniatures have been custom painted! In my opinion they are very nicely detailed! All mini cards are sleeved in premium Fantasy Flight brand sleeves! The 18 bonus character cards and token are all still included, too! 
There is only a little standard wear on the manual. The tokens, cards, and miniatures are all like new! There is just a little standard shelf wear along some of the corners and edges of the box.</notes>
