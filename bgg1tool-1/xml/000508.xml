   <description>In Blue Max, each player pilots a WWI airplane in a dogfight. The game can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;restricted_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If you _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;tail_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Summary of information for Blue Max Miniatures Edition
Brief Description:
A set of rules to simulate air to air combat of world war I using miniature aircraft on a hex grid playing surface. Most common scales seem to be 1/72 and 1/144 scale models. 1/72 scale being most popular at gaming conventions. Blue Max uses _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;plotted_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; movement in turns with simultaneous movement followed by combat for that game turn. Damage is allocated with a unique system of damage chits that have color coded sides to represent different levels of damage. Players keep track of the status of their aircraft, ammunition supply and maneuvers on specially designed easy to use record sheets. The scale of the game allows for players to control their planes maneuvers on a turn by turn basis. The Game Turn Sequence
* Tailing step.
* Maneuver selection step.
* Fuel Expenditure step.
* Movement step.
* Combat step.
* Damage step.
* Recovery step.
* Problem step.
* Fire damage step.
* Fire/smoke extinguishing step.
Period:
Air combat from 1914-1918 during World War I. The original boxed edition of Blue Max only covered the latter portion of the war from 1917-1918. The new Miniatures rules cover the entire war and can be used alone or as an expansion module to the boxed set.
Scale:
1:1 - each counter/model represents one plane. Each turn represents approximately 3-4 seconds of time - ground scale is abstracted by representing plane speed in hexes: One hex of movement is roughly 85/95mph then goes up by 5mph per hex. (85mph for early war / 95mph for late war)
Basing:
For miniatures play most players use a hex shaped base of aircraft plywood with telescoping antennas to allow for the different altitude ranges the game can represent. The most popular scale is 1/72 scale plastic models but 1/144 scale lead miniatures can also be used.
Contents:
Miniatures Rules include 16 page booklet with expanded campaign, altitude and optional rules, 140 counters for damage allocation and tailing, Combat chart, Aircraft record sheets, Flight log and 44 Aircraft Maneuver Schedules covering aircraft for the entire war.
Game Designers:
Phillip Hall (Primary designer for all editions) and
Allan Wright (Contributed to the Miniatures Edition)</notes>

    <notes>Blue Max: Dogfights over France (1983) by Game Designers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Workshop
Box: Light shelfwear with a few dings, dents and wrinkles. Box top has some light dishing and two corner creases (as if from box stacking).  Overall, the box is in excellent condition!
Components: Complete and in very good or better condition!  A couple of the plane chits have stains on them, and some of the maneuver schedules have started to color with age.  Other than that, components are crisp and like new, with no writing on the rules or anywhere else.  Record pad still has 20 sheets left.  The pieces have been separated and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 2 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.

    <notes>1992 Update Version by GDW Games.  Punched but only used once.  Some wear on corners of box.  I like the game a lot, but actually got the game as reference for painting and playing Blue Max with miniatures. (Beautiful counters!)</notes>

All the aircraft counters have an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; written on them in blue ink in front of the ID number, and the rulebook has an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; written in the upper right corner of the front page. Two photocopies of the rules are also included. All components are present with some extras - 5 combat reference cards rather than 4 and 22 maneuver schedules rather than 18. The reference cards each have an _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;M_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; written on them.</notes>

    <notes>FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES (FFGST09)
Blue Max, the famous game of World War I aerial combat, is back with new graphics and updated rules! In Blue Max, two to six players take the roles of pilots belonging to the Allies or the Central Powers, and aim to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible. Including rules that account for altitude, fuel reserves, and the maneuverability of your plane, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to both master your machine and outwit your foes in order to win. This updated edition of Blue Max places you squarely in a World War I cockpit and supports two to six players. With six different airplanes, new graphics, deep mechanics, and a revised rule set, Blue Max will keep you on the edge of your seat. </notes>
