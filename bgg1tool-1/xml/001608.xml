Using a ground-breaking development of the programmed paragraph solitaire system, Ambush! gives the player control of an American squad, faced with a variety of missions against an ever-changing, hidden German foe.  The variable events, innumerable tactical options, and wealth of unexpected occurrences make Ambush! a solitaire gaming experience unlike any that has gone before. The easily learned rules are specially designed to get the player into the action within minutes.  The player selects and arms his squad, providing each soldier with command and initiative ratings, perception, weapons skill, driving skill, and movement capability. After selecting one of the eight missions provided, the player sends his squad into a mission map to conduct operations called for in the mission.  Soldiers move freely, as far as the player wishes, checking for events each time they move...until the sequenced action rounds are triggered by the whine of German bullets!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Condition - counters punched/sorted.  Vehicles card collated.  Played a few times.  Mission Cartridge View Sleeve has lines drawn upon it to help line up the slots with the hex numbers.  In addition paragraph book has a few small black stickers near some paragraphs.  Therefore, calling condition _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; instead of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.

    <notes>This is an UNPUNCHED and UNPLAYED copy of the 1983 Victory Games WWII solitaire squad level game.  The box is in pretty good shape considering the 1983 publication date.  The box shows some corner wear with one unrepaired split corner.  It is 100% complete even down to the Avalon Hill price list and full color catalog.</notes>

    <notes>Used, partly punched, in good condition with extra countersheet. Roughly 8 of the original (punched) counters are missing, but there is an extra unpunched countersheet that I will include, so you should have more than enough counters to play the game. Contains two copies of the same map. Box shows a bit of minor wear, but nothing bad. There is a small price sticker affixed to the back of the box. Email me if you have any questions, or if you need a more detailed inventory of the contents.</notes>

    <notes>Out of Print Game
Appears unplayed or played once.  Cards unpunched.
Counters are punched. My count yielded 217 of 218 counters present. If there is a counter missing and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s somehow vital, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send it to you from my other copy of the game. There are a lot of marker counters, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m guessing a possible missing counter would probably not be vital.  
Box is very sturdy and in very good condition;it has some edgewear. All other components present and in excellent condition. There are 4 ten-sided dice included instead of 2 as specified on BGG.
Shipping cost is exact postage plus 1$ for packaging/handling. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll mail it anyway you want, parcel post, priority, or express.
USA seller, with perfect ebay feedback I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll refer you to upon request.
Note: Shipping to non-USA countries is expensive and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only ship there to bidders with multiple positive feedback.</notes>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>*Verified COMPLETE* copy.  Good condition.  Box has wear and tear, one corner starting to rip.  
Comes with original chit tray, but these were horrible; I will throw in a *FREE Chessex or GMT tray*, your choice.  If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t specify, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll pick.
Can provide photos and/or further description upon request.  A great game; this is a spare or I would not part with it.  Price INCLUDES SHIPPING, but I will ship **CONUS only**.  Terribly sorry, Rest of World.
PayPal preferred, but Checks/MOs okay (won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;til cleared, though).
NOTE:  I seem to be attracting a great number of lowball offers, both for purchase and trade (half price, or offers to trade two of my rare and OOP games for a single game that can be had new for $35).  These will be rejected out of hand without so much as a counteroffer; I am in no hurry to unload these, so please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t waste your time and mine with ridiculous offers; it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just insulting.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Ambush comes with a complete copy of Ambush: Move Out! in the same box.
Ambush! is missing 1 chit.  It has 217 instead of 218.  I do not know which chit is missing as I bought this used and have never gotten to play it. All of the rest of the pieces are present.  The box shows some shelf wear and there is some writing on the player screen.  Some of the roster sheets have been used.  This is a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy.

    <notes>Box shows wear.  When I counted chits it seems that a few are missing,but these are very easy to make to replace. They are just tiny squares.  I played a couple scenarios and didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need any of the missing chits. 
Everything else seems intact and complete. I can accept google checkout or checks, money orders.  Shipping $8 most places in US. </notes>

Note: I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game on behalf of a friend whose father recently passed and who had a remarkable collection of games that I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting in coming weeks. There are too many games in this collection for me to meticulously inventory beyond just a basic review but I have no reason to expect any problems with these games as I personally know they have been very well cared for the last 20+ years (generally all the games in this collection are lightly played). Other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be posting from this collection include: Outpost, Magic Realm, Divine Right, Gunslinger, Merchant of Venus, The Lonely Mountain, Sword and Sorcery, Talisman, and nearly 30 others so please ask if there is something else you are looking for from this era as I might actually have it.</notes>

    <notes>I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think this copy has ever been played, however there are a few flaws. The counters appear slightly dirty or stained on the top side. The Rules booklet staples are rusted and the cover and back sheet has torn thru the top staple. The paragraph booklet staples are also rusted slightly. The initiative counter for the German N soldier is missing. I made a perfectly functional replacement but is not fancy or beautiful. Everything else appears unused. </notes>

-------------------------------
Due to high shipping costs and general amount of paper work involved, I am limiting the sale on this game to US only.
This game is listed as part of a group that I am selling to benefit the Sun Tzu Military History Museum.
The games were owned by friend who passed this past January, and he wanted to make sure his games were
sold to benefit his charity of choice.  
Many of the games have rules underlining, which I have tried to catalog in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition.  I have also 
tried to give as complete and accurate description as possible.  Games are complete, unless otherwise noted.  A few of the older games may have handmade
replacement counters.  Again, I have tried to identify these items in the game description.  If you are concerned about specifics of condition that are not in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s description, please geekmail me, and I will give a very specific accounting of whatever
you may have questions on.
For any games that are missing pieces, I heartily recommend checking the BGG Spare Parts 2012 wanted/have geeklist.  Several users of this site have been very generous in helping find missing components!  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/76707/2012-spare-parts-resource-list
Prices are firm on single purchases, but I will consider offers on multiple games.  I will ship multiple purchases together to try and save you money on shipping.
Photos are available upon request!
Local pickup available in the Denver Metro area.  I live in South West Aurora and we can meet at a place that makes sense. </notes>

    <notes>Box has quite a bit of wear, the components are otherwise in great shape. I counted the cards and counters.  All the cards are accounted for. It has 215 counters instead of the 218 listed on the box back, but looking at the unpunched images on BGG it appears the extra three counters were blanks.
Shipping is $12. Combined shipping rates are available when purchasing multiple items.

    <notes>Game is complete, in excellant condition, and unpunched *except*: four chits fell out of the selvage and were, of course, lost.  I have replaced them from another copy of the game.  The replacements look like new but are of a different shade of green than the rest.  Should not affect play at all but they are noticably different.</notes>

    <notes>A well-used, tatty copy that I bought from a Bring _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Buy sale at a show. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve not got round to playing it myself.
- Box is in poor shape, with a tear down one corner.
- There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no counter tray. Other than that I believe all components are present but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve not done a card/counter count yet.
- The rules booklet is marked and stained on the cover.
- One map is a bit creased and has two small tears in different hexes (blu tak removal or similar?)
- The cartridge view sleeve has a small stain (tea splash or similar) about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; wide.
If it was a book, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d describe it as a reading copy. No good if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re after a collectable copy, but if you just want to actually play the game it should do fine.
Shipping from the UK. Happy to ship anywhere. 
P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P will be charged at cost. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested please get in touch with your location and I can give you options and estimates.
Personal cheques can only be accepted from UK members. Overseas buyers Paypal only please.

    <notes>The components are unpunched and in mint condition. I bought this game unplayed (and I never played it), but the box had shelf wear and they had taped it in 2 places to keep the box closed. I sliced the tape to look at the components to make sure that they were all there and unpunched. But the tape is still on the box. The box is very sturdy and no corners are taped. But the 4 corners have scuff marks and there is normal shelf wear to the box. </notes>

    <notes>This price includes the Move Out expansion.
Both boxes are quite old and faded. Move Out has a slight tear on one edge and I can provide photos if requested.
Ambush was missing a print on a mission sheet and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve fixed it myself (ie. looks like the printer missed the page back in 1983)..
Otherwise the rest of the components, incl. maps and components, are complete and in good condition.</notes>

Da spedinare. Come nuovo.
Unpunched. All components in excellent conditions (please check picture for more references).
INTERNATIONAL BUYERS - The shipment charges are based on shipping a parcel  by International Guaranted Mail with tracking number. The costs depend both on the zone you live AND the weight of the parcel. I am considering 3 different ranges of weight (from 250 to 350 grammes/ from 350 grammes to 1 kilo/ from 1 kilo to 2 kilos). Most of the games are in the 350 - 1 kilo range (NOT this one however, because it weights more than 1 kilo). In the case the parcel would weight more than 2 kilos (as in a case of a combined shipment) I ll have to ship it by another mean (i.e. QPE or EMS) and have to recalculate the costs. Anyway for any doubt or questions, please, feel free to ask in advance. I am also glad to upload more pictures if needed.
Europe and some African countries : 10,60/ 14,40  / 21,10 euro.
US, Canada, other countries of America and Africa: 13,90/ 20,00 / 29,90 euro.
Oceania : 17,80/ 26,70 / 37,80 euro.
In the case of a miscalculation in your favor I ll refund any eventual surplus charge.</notes>

===================
Complete. Components are in very good condition. Counters punched, but not clipped/rounded. Counter tray present. Some squad record sheets were used, but some originals are still present. There is a very small stain on the right lower corner of Map A (see photo). Box has a little shelfwear, but looks good.
Includes an unpunched unused copy of Ambush! Move Out!: Character and Vehicle Cards are still in sheets. The front of the box is somewhat dented.</notes>

    <notes>I would like to pass this on as possibly a parts copy, as the game is missing 43 counters. The box says 218 and I counted 175. Other than that, the game is complete. Some occasional writing/notes in paragraph and rules book. I am trying to get back what I paid, as I never played the game.
I am not sure how essential the missing counters were or what they what they represented. I separated as best possible and will include the list in the game.
The squad sheets are copied from the original sheet.
Box is worn and split on the bottom right corner.
Again, I do not know if this is the forum to pass a game like this on. Any other suggestions on this site would be appreciated.

SHIPPING:
   USA: $12.95 shipping in USA.
   MULTIPLE ITEMS: I combine shipping!  So look at my other games for sale.  If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re interested in any of my other games for sale, the additional shipping cost would only be about $3 per large game, or ~$1 per small/card game. 
   MASSACHUSETTS: Local buyers may pick up orders of $25 or more in person, in Billerica or Cambridge.
   INTERNATIONAL: Please ask about international shipping costs before ordering.  The shipping to most countries, for a normal-size game, is at least $40!
   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)  
PAYMENT: You may pay by PayPal.com to karlhanf@comcast.net; by amazon.com gift card; or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re patient, by mailing a check to me.</notes>

    <notes>Box has shelf wear and inner (not lid) box has a torn corner. This is a game from 1983, so it has been around for a while. I have set up and played mission 1. Amazing game but I just do not have the free time to devote to it that it deserves. As far as I can tell, all components are present (I did not see a component list in the manual). I have a printed player aid in the box (such as it is), and a GMT (?) counter tray (original?). 5 unmarked squad sheets remain.</notes>

    <notes>Shrinkwrap copy.  Yes I said SHRINKWRAP copy.  There is still a price tag on the shrink from 1990.  Shrink is intact except for some wearing through on the corners which has caused some corner whitening on the box.  If you look real close you will see a small corner wrinkle on the back of the box.  This is the original - this is the classic - still unopened - still in shrink.  Worldwide shipping and will be packed well.  All forms of negotiable instruments considered.

    <notes>Box looks its age, and there was another box on top, therefore it is dented in and has scuff marks. One corner split but has been taped.
The game itself is punched and in excellent condition. All contents is accounted for (I checked all the chits and cards as well)
Comes with its own plastic insert for the chits.
Will ship after paid in full. Checks and MOs accepted, but need to be cleared.
Shipping and handling is covered by buyer, and should be around $12 (but will check to make sure) and will be via USPS.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not responsible for mailing issues once the game is mailed, but will send it with tracking information to assure delivery goes smooth.</notes>

    <notes>Box shows some shelf wear due to age, rule and paragraph books show minor wear from being flipped through, and a few counters show some scuffing. Only a few of the squad record sheets remain, but more can be printed off from this site. Game appears to have been played multiple times, but all components are present and mostly look great.</notes>

    <notes>like new but for the box which is average. counters punched and verified like new, the cards are more very good but none with obvious defects for i have 2 partial decks for spares and weed out blemished/torn/stained cards by going card by card quick examination. Rules may have been read some and more than a quick read through. guy might have died before play and the survivors dumped it on a flea market (foreign readers it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a thrift temporary market) as it originally had a 50cent price tag. that box art doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t go over well with hobbyists or regular folk as it looks like it should have numerous plastic soldier figures. The remaining game components are commensurate in quality with an unused game. 
PLUS inc;udes  a like new Battleplan #4 with cards insert still inserted. This issue has the 14 or so page January 1945 post Ardennes Offensive _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Block Party_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; complete campaign scenario. Plus I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include photocopies of the other Battleplan which has an Ambush Fallschirmjager campaign too.
I have a less expensive copy for sale without the magazines and in a more used condition. still very good primarily the high usage counters look high usage. In this series the counters are all just generic and/or info markers and most anyone involved in the hobby for a spell has numerous games that you can borrow counters from to make Ambush work without deteriorating the appeal of playing with actual physical components instead of bits _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; bytes</notes>

    <notes>Ambush! 
Game in great condition for its age. Acquired years ago through BGG punched but unplayed; unfortunately haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t had the time to try it personally. 
The box has slight shelf wear but is still strong and sturdy - no issue there.
The components are all present (carefully inventoried everything when I got it) and basically untouched (soldier cards, mission cartridges, books, etc. clean)
Also includes a 3-page colour print-out of a player aid from BGG. 
Shipping to UK:  £4   (2nd class signed for). 
Europe: £13.5 (for game of this value, I would use tracked and signed with cover)</notes>
