    <notes>There is a scuff mark to a corner of the box lid. It was like this when received from retailer. Probably sustained during transit but not enough to moan about. The actual game parts are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;as new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; having been only played once and are all present.
 I will send this game to the eventual buyer using a courier delivery service.
 To most mainland UK destinations the p _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; p cost will be £6.00. Some more remote areas will cost a little more.
 The p _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; p charge to mainland Europe will be £24.50 for a single game. It will be tracked and needs to be signed for upon receipt.</notes>

Shipping weight is 5lb. Game is too large for a Flat Rate box, so shipping will be by whatever USPS service works with the rate depending on your distance from CA, probably ~$12.</notes>
