   <description>Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;ve undertaken to date,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;While it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; all create the sense that you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re constructing a royal palace._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; said the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s co-designer, Bruno Cathala. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s a classic _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;lsquo;push your luck_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo; dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description from the publisher._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 101055N)
Cleopatra _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra’s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.
Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price - cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.

Theme: Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra’s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace. Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price – cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 101055N)
Cleopatra _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra’s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.
Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price – cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.

    <notes>Only listed as Like New because it is out of shrink and punched, but never played, only inventoried.  
I prefer paypal, but other arrangements for payment are possible if you geekmail me prior to adding the game to your cart and checking out.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship anywhere, but the buyer assumes all responsibility for shipping or post charges.  I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge you any more than it costs me to ship it.  
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing a bunch of games this month and I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t do this professionally so please bear with me and be reasonable when it comes to shipping time.  If you purchase and pay Friday evening my time, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t expect the package to go out until Monday at the soonest.  I should be able to go to the post office for simple domestic shipping several times a week, but I probably will consolidate all overseas shipments to one weekly trip.
Check out my other games listed.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll do my best to offer multi-game order discounts and combined shipping, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not making it a rock-solid offer because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want someone getting $5 off each additional game and then buying 10 card games or something that would only sell for $5-$10 anyways.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to be generous to stir up sales, but not take a Net Loss on everything any more than I have to.
If you have any other questions or would like to request that I put up a particular game from my collection, Geekmail me with a reasonable offer.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m kinda making decisions as I go along through my collection, so I would probably be willing to sell a game I was on the fence about if I knew there was a guaranteed sale imminent.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>Only played once, pristine condition.  I did toss part of the original storage mechanism in exchange for a Plano 3500 case which I have included (allows for better storing of the game on its side and better organization during gameplay).  Box, components, cards, etc, all in perfect condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $11.35 for USPS Priority Mail with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be actual price plus USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees). I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Item is in Good condition.  I graded it as acceptable, though, because it is missing one black and one purple Anubis token.  These tokens are easily substituted, though.  
I have played it 2-3 times.  We are a non-smoking household.
Cost to ship is actual shipping cost in the United States using Priority Mail.  
Send me a PM if you have questions before buying.</notes>

    <notes>There is some minor shelf wear on the bottom of the box. The top box has a small tear in a corner and the previous owner went overboard in reinforcing all the corners with packing tape. The components are verified complete and like new. This is a unique game with amazing production value. I just don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get it to the table often enough to justify holding on to it if I could instead sell it for a fair price.</notes>

    <notes>Thank you for checking out my listing!
Brand NEW and never played!! I took the shrink wrap off to admire the beautiful contents but everything is still sealed and never removed! Some of the counters did _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;self-punch_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; as they just fell off when I moved it but this happens with every copy of the game.
I have seen some crazy prices for a brand new copy of this game but I am not into gouging people on some rare item...hence the reason I tried to list it at a reasonable asking price here. 
Feel free to ask any questions that I have not already addressed.
International buyers are welcome!</notes>

    <notes>I bought this game new quite a few years ago, and haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t gotten it to the table in a long time, so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to move on!
I just went through the box - everything is there, and for the most part in like new condition. The only wear and tear is a couple small spots in two of the pyramids where some paper was torn off. I found some type of red plastic-like material stuck on one of the trays...it scraped off most places just fine, but it did cause this tiny bit of damage to those two cardboard bits. You can see it in the pictures attached. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s really minor.
All of the cards and non-plastic components are bagged (inside the game box) for transit.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be shipping via whatever the cheapest USPS Priority Mail method is, depending on your location. The medium flat rate box is ~$14 to the USA, so it won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be more than that (unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re outside the USA, in which case it will probably be a lot more).</notes>

Shipping:
I am happy to combine shipping on multiple items.
I can ship from both US and (if you are patient) Canada.
I will find the cheapest shipping method. Within the continental USA, this is typically Fedex. International shipping can be very expensive. 
Insurance and tracking:
I recommend paying for both of these. As a hobbyist and an individual seller, I cannot take responsibility for items that are damaged or lost in transit.</notes>

    <notes>With a baby on the way, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m clearing out a bunch of games. I have no seller feedback, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been a BGG member since 2004 and have bought a handful of games. I am shipping from 27707 and am happy to combine items for reduced shipping or meet in person. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to entertain any bulk offers, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to send photos or connect over the phone to establish credibility if the lack of feedback is worrisome.

    <notes>For calesher only
Bought used, played once or twice by me, lightly played overall. Rules say there are 110 cards, but if you count the inventory of the cards, there are 109, which is what I have in my set. Some shelf wear, and the insert that holds the temple pieces has tape on it. It also looks like the plastic lid for the temple piece holder might have been taped at some point. No major issues. English edition (2006) Days of Wonder

    <notes>Complete and in gently played condition. The only component wear worth mentioning specifically is:
1. The corruption pyramids look fairly used.
2. The cardboard on the bottom of the quarry is separating a bit - could easily be fixed with a touch of glue, or is fine as-is as it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t affect anything. 
Shipping will probably be around $15 for most of the U.S.</notes>

    <notes>My copy is in great shape. However, I did take paint and wash over the plastic building pieces to help shadow some of the detail. (See picture.) The game is from a pet free, smoke free home. Buyer pays actual shipping from 44654. Thanks for looking!</notes>
