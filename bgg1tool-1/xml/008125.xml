   <description>Santiago is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Santiago by Amigo
Box:  Moderate shelfwear with several significant dings, dents, and creases.  In particular, the upper right corner of the box cover has a corner ding that has caused a 1/2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; split along the upper box edge, and there are a few areas where the box paper has been scratched by a sharp object.  Overall the box is in very good+ condition!
Components:  Complete and in like new condition!   The pieces have been sorted and stored in plastic bags for convenience and protection - you will be very pleased with how the game has been packaged.
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 3 Lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

    <notes>This is a German edition, but has the English rules printed out.  The game is comepletely language independent.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no text on any of the pieces.  Box is fading in some areas with minor scuffing on the corners.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still sturdy and holding strong with lots of life left.  The board and bits are all in great shape.  Feel free to ask for a shipping estimate.</notes>

    <notes>Game has been gently played.
My husband was an avid board game player/collector.  He took great car of his games and they have all been stored in a smoke free environment.  He passed away 4 years ago, and I am trying to find new homes for all of the games.  If game have been played, they were gently played, as he allowed no food or drink near his games.  Thank you!</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size]

[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
[i]US buyers:[/i]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company.  If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you, the receiver) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having any problem, but theoretically there is some risk).  I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, I cannot remember ever having any problem.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.
