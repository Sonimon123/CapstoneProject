   <description>Kamisado is a game of pure skill and strategy with no dice, cards or other chance element _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; it's just you against your opponent!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The aim in each round is to be the first to get an octagonal _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;dragon tower_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; to the opposite side of the board; towers move in straight lines, either forwards or diagonally forwards. The twist is that you must move the tower of the color matching the space on which the opponent moved on her previous turn. As the game progresses, you'll find that the routes you want to use are blocked by enemy towers _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and sometimes your own! If you can't move, your opponent moves again immediately, moving the tower matching the color of the space occupied by the stymied tower._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;As the game unfolds, your towers will be promoted to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Sumos_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; and have the ability to push your opponent's pieces backwards, earning you extra turns. The situations continue to become more complex and challenging, until one player accumulates the required winning total and can be declared a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Kamisado Grand Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; until the next game!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Kamisado is a game of pure skill and strategy! There are no dice, cards or any other chance element -- just you against your opponent. The aim in each round is to be the first to get an octagonal ‘dragon tower’ to the opposite side of the board by moving the towers in straight lines, either forward or diagonally. It sounds easy, doesn’t it? Well, of course there’s a twist: You can only move a tower if its color matches the color of the square your opponent last moved to. Also, you’ll sometimes find the routes you want to use blocked by enemy towers (and sometimes your own!). As the game unfolds, your towers will be promoted to ‘Sumos’, and will gain the ability to push your opponent’s pieces backwards, earning you extra turns. The situations continue to become more complex and challenging, until one player accumulates the required winning total and can be declared a ‘Kamisado Grand Master’!</notes>

    <notes>FRED Distribution (FDD 101132N)
Kamisado is a game of pure skill and strategy! There are no dice, cards or any other chance element -- just you against your opponent. The aim in each round is to be the first to get an octagonal ‘dragon tower’ to the opposite side of the board by moving the towers in straight lines, either forward or diagonally. It sounds easy, doesn’t it? Well, of course there’s a twist: You can only move a tower if its color matches the color of the square your opponent last moved to. Also, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll sometimes find the routes you want to use blocked by enemy towers (and sometimes your own!). As the game unfolds, your towers will be promoted to _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Sumos_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;, and will gain the ability to push your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pieces backwards, earning you extra turns. The situations continue to become more complex and challenging, until one player accumulates the required winning total and can be declared a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Kamisado Grand Master_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;!</notes>
