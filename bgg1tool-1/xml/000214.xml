   <description>This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Minor ding on box, otherwise unplayed and perfect condition.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games.  Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  High-resolution picture available upon request.  
Domestic US shipping is actual shipping cost for approx. 54oz (incl. box) to your zip code from 30082 plus $3 for box and packaging (I will finalize after you order).  International shipping will be actual price plus USD$6.00 (for the box and hassle, sorry, it is much more effort on my end).  Contact me if you have any questions about shipping.
Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).  I have many other games up for sale and in most cases I can combine shipping for some significant savings, but please check with me and provide your zip code for details.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO519)
Café International is a meeting place where guests from many different nations get together. Here, guests may have a nice chat with others while enjoying a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and some pie. That is why you will often find guests from different nations sitting at one table. If there is no seat available at the tables, guests may also sit at the bar. The purpose of the game is to bring as many people into the Café International as possible, according to these rules and by placing your small guests at the tables or at the bar in a clever way. Player score each round by seating guests at tables as allowed by these rules. They _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;record_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; their scores by taking the different colored chips (black=1 point, red=5 points, and blue=10 points). Players may also lose points when seating guests at the bar or having un-seated guests at the end of the game. Players make _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;make change_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; with their chips at any time when they earn or lose points so that the amount matches their gain or loss.</notes>
