    <notes>Cool Mini Or Not (CMNR001)
Rivet Wars is a miniatures board game that springs forth from the warped imagination of Ted Terranova - set on a world that never quite left World War I but with crazy technology like walking tanks, diesel powered armor, unicycle vehicles and armor plated cavalry! Don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t let the cute visuals fool you, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a world full of angst, war-torn camaraderie and dark humor. Rivet Wars is at its heart a strategy game, with both players deploying units each round to counter the threats set forth by their opponent and stay one tactical step ahead. Heavily influenced by Ted_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s experience working on RTS games like Rise of Nations, players gather resources (bunkers and capture points) and use these to deploy streams of new units! There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s an ebb and flow on the tactical landscape and you can stock up surprises for your opponent to be unleashed even as he thinks he_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s winning! </notes>

    <notes>Did you miss the Kickstarter? Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your chance to correct that! 
This bundle is for a KS Blitzkreig level of Rivet Wars, and tons of add-ons!
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m just trying to recoup most of my expense, so this lot is listed for LESS than the price I paid for it.
Everything is NIB/NIS, except the external shrink has been removed from the base game only.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing everything using the names of the boxes the items were received in (because they combined many stretch goals into retail packages).

*** Payment:
Within Euro-zone the EU-standard-bank-transfer (SEPA, IBAN/BIC) is recommended, 
it´s quick, save and causes no fees. 
Paypal is certainly also possible, fees within EU are 0,35 Euro + 1,9% of the total.
Worldwide (outside the EURO-zone) Paypal is recommended.
Paypal -fees are 0,35 Euro + (3,9% - 5,2%) of the total.
For nearly all countries outside Europe, apart from USA and Canada (both 3,9%), the rate is 5.2%.
The fees of the payment method you choose and the real shipping costs you have to pay.
Thank you. Stephan.
 Paypal and bank transfer
