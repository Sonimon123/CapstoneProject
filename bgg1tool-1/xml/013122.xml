Why don't we start farming olives, like our neighbors?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The cart-driver nods: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Ever since them city folks started worshiping San Giorgio I have to travel further and further to new building sites. I'm on my way now to the new inn they built. I'll change horses there and deliver this load,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we'll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The farmer nods his head in reply. As the cart starts moving again, he returns to the field to harvest the last bushels of grain, growing between the stumps of what used to be a lush forest -- three turns ago._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Antiquity is a strategy game for 2-4 players. It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;While your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm. Let's hope one of you has won the game before that time!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is a new blue-box edition. The game did not come with shrink. It shipped to me directly from Splotter. Some of the tiles are not in their trees as there is a lot of air in the overly large box, but the game is new, unplayed and unpunched. There is a small crease in one corner of the bottom of the box, a result of initial packaging/shipping from the company.
Buyer to pay USPS shipping, Priority is preferred but I will ship it media if you want (within the US). Personal checks must clear before shipping.</notes>

I will ship USPS, UPS or Fed Ex at my discretion. While I take every measure to make sure the game is packed carefully and well, I cannot be responsible for damages caused during shipping. Insurance is available to the buyer at cost.

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition.  All the components are present and correct.  This is perilously close to the 2kg limit for Royal Mail, so hopefully my packing weight estimate is accurate.

UK First class  £7.55 
Surface Worldwide  £13.17 
Europe Airmail  £12.29 
USA Airmail  £24.26 
Shipping costs shown are for an individual game. I will combine shipping as best I can. Large packages (5kg, say 6 games) are very cost-effective to ship internationally via DHL. Ask if you want a detailed price.

    <notes>Antiquity (2004) from Splotter Spellen
Box: Light shelf-wear and a small area near the bottom of the front cover where the box is dented and wrinkled. Overall the box is in excellent+ condition!
Contents: New, unpunched (mostly) and in Mint Condition! I say mostly unpunched because, though the game is brand new and has never been played, a large portion of the pollution markers, a bunch of fish, sheep and a few others have just fallen out of the counter sheets. I have rounded up the ones that fell out and sorted and stored them in plastic bags, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s pretty likely that more will fall out by the time it gets to you. They will not be damaged at all, but please be aware of this.
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 6 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>2nd Edition- This game did not originally come with shrinkwrap and also was a ding and dent game.  There is some slight warping of the box but it is structurally intact.  I punched the chits because many were falling out.  They are meticulously separated and bagged but the game remains unplayed. Shipping is $11.95 US. everything in complete and unplayed condition.  
Will combine shipping. Will ship worldwide. Just ask for a quote first.  
Must pay within 3 days of purchase acceptance otherwise please do not check-out the item. </notes>

    <notes>2nd Edition: Punched and bagged, but never played. :(
The box was never in shrink (it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s how the publisher sent them) so there might be some scuffing.
Also, the box is pretty huge, so shipping will be higher then your typical board game.

    <notes>Antiquity (2004 first edition with blue box) by Splotter
Box:  Light shelfwear with a few extremely minor dings and dents and several creases.  Box top has three major corner creases measuring approximately 12_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, 6_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, and 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.  Overall the box is in very good to excellent condition!
Components:  All limited components (buildings, player mats, cubes, extra city maps, terrain platters, etc.) have been counted and verified complete.  Resources, pollution counters, and meadow hexes have not been counted because there are dozens upon dozens of them, and I guarantee that there are plenty to cover you for any game of Antiquity.  If you should ever find yourself short of a resource, please let me know and I will send you some from our personal copy.  All components are in like new condition!  
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 6 lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

Box also has one split edge along top, but box still very sturdy. The shipping will be fairly significant given the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s size and weight.

    <notes>This is NOT a copy of Antiquity. This is a hand-made wooden tray that fits all the chits and wooden pieces perfectly in the box. The tray has been stained in red mahogany and coated with polyurethane. See pictures below of custom fit in the box.
Doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t your $150 game deserve a well-crafted solution to organize and store the bits?!?
The price is $23.00 plus shipping.

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Shipping will be actual cost (probably $15-$25) due to the size of the game. Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>Brand new in box, what more can I say ;)
The box is in great condition. I just do not have anyone to play this with unfortunately...
For shipping, I charge only actual shipping. It varies between 15$ and 25$ depending on the box size and weight. Shipping originates from Montreal, Canada (H2W 2M7).
I will gladly combine shipping if you purchase multiple items. I can ship outside of North America, if needed, but keep in mind that shipping could be very expensive if you require tracking.
Thanks and enjoy!</notes>

    <notes>Condition:
- never played, but it has got some small damages to the box during storing. See pictures in my personal boardgamegeek-gallery for details. If you want, I can take more photos.
- the components are in like new condition, as the game has never been played. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve only punched and organized the tokens in plastic bags.
Shipping:
- please note that shipping from Norway may be expensive and that the box is heavy (approx. 1,8 kg before adding wrapping paper etc). Size of the box: approx. 32 x 51 x 7 cm. See the following link to Norwegian postal services for information about prices (information in Norwegian, but I assume it is relatively easy to understand for foreigners):

- buyer pays for shipping and any import duties etc that may be applicable in your country.
- you may save shipping costs if you also buy one or more of the other games I have for sale.</notes>

    <notes>RESERVED FOR User: mikester9809
In addition to the money, there is also a trade involved.
Mike will send to me the following two games
Strasbourg https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91873/strasbourg
Arkadia https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25643/arkadia
Shipping is to be covered by me to Mike_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s US address.
Used, some dishing to the cover of the box, complete components, 2 storage containers to hold all the bits.  I accidentally ended up with 2 copies of this game because I forgot I had bid on a eBay 
auction several weeks prior to obtaining one at the BGG marketplace.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, punched, never played. The box top came dished--there is a line on the right side, as if pressure was applied to the top of the box. But if you see and feel the box, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll understand how you would expect this out of every copy of Antiquity--the box simply isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the thickest, and with the size, shape, etc., it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s to be expected.
The components are in mint condition--never played. You can in the photo see some of the chits still stuck together, since I never got around to actually pulling all of them apart. I did organize all the buildings and castles into four bags, one for each player.
This is a big box, so to allay shipping concerns, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll say $15 flat rate and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll cover whatever goes over that, provided it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not exorbitant. Local pickup available in the D.C. area (20815).</notes>

    <notes>Unplayed and unpunched... though a lot of pieces have self-punched themselves within the box. Large box, will ship anywhere I can ship it to... buyer pays actual shipping costs. PayPal easiest, but happy to work with other payment options if needed. 
Downscaling my collection... never played this one, and not sure when I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d ever get to it at this point. Have other Splotter games, too, like Duck Dealer, if interested. 
This is a Second Edition game. 
Let me know if you have any questions, want photos, or whatever. 
FREE shipping to continental USA. Inquire with location outside USA for shipping quote.</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink.  The player aids came outside of the shrink-wrapped box (directly from Splotter), and are in perfect condition.  I will ship using
a USPS flat rate box, meaning shipping will be $13.65 (paid by the buyer).  The total will be $103.65, and I will only accept payment through PayPal.</notes>
