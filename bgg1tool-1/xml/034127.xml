   <description>A New Train Adventure Begins!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the excitement, fun, and nail-biting tension of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several unique game-play twists in a new stand-alone, card game format._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards, which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;train robbing,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Part of the Ticket to Ride series._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Train robbing._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>I ship everything via USPS Priority Mail flat rate boxes - with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Fragile,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Keep Dry,_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Do Not Bend_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; written on the boxes. The rate structure for those boxes is as follows:
Shipping for games that will fit within a 8.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 5.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 1.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $4.95.
Shipping for games that will fit within a 13.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 11.75_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; X 3.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; box costs $10.70.
I can easily combine shipping if games will fit within these boxes. If they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t, I can still combine shipping, but that is a little tricker. Thursdays are the days I get most of my shipping done, if that helps you.</notes>

    <notes>I am having clear out of games that my wife isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t keen on (my main game playing is with her).
All components are present and in the original game box. 
There is hardly any wear, as we have only played a couple of times.
The price for second class postage in the UK is £5 (The game is very heavy, about 1.5kg), if you buy any of my other items at the same time I will reduce the postage.
I do not want to post the game abroad and I only accept payment by Paypal.
Thanks
Martin

A New Train Adventure Begins! The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the exciting, fun and easy-to-learn elements of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several new game-play twists in a stand-alone, portable, card game format. Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;train-robbing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards. Every fan of the board game will want to own a copy of the Ticket to Ride Card Game!

    <notes>Due to continuing storage problems, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m regularly selling (least-played) games from my personal collection.
I did like all the games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling , but with 200+ board and card games there are always other (comparable) contenders that just speak to me more. And besides, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m a real collector, always trying to perfect my collection with games I only like best (at that moment in time).
The low pricing, therefore, is simple (if you were wondering): I just want to make other people happy for a few bucks/euros. Enabling me to purchase a new game every four or five orders.
This game - Ticket to Ride: The Card Game - has been unwrapped, opened, and only played once. Basically, this means that the condition of the game is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.
Shipping from The Netherlands, Utrecht (PostNL or Kiala). So, before placing your order, please ask me for a shipping and packaging cost estimate first!
Thank you for visiting and do check out the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling: https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/chidentity ...</notes>

    <notes>Days of Wonder (DOW7219)
A New Train Adventure Begins! The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the exciting, fun and easy-to-learn elements of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several new game-play twists in a stand-alone, portable, card game format. Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;train-robbing_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards. Every fan of the board game will want to own a copy of the Ticket to Ride Card Game!</notes>

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home.
Still in shrinkwrap.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

Days of Wonder (c) 2007.
German edition.
All game materials are still in mint condition.
Shipping:
All shipping is done via DHL. Shipping costs depend on size and weight of the parcel and destination.
