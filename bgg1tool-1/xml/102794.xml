   <description>Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Picked this up at Essen, played it one and a half times, thought it was a pleasant experience but also came to the unfortunate conclusion that I am done with worker placement for the time being and this should go to a better home where all the animeeples can get some more love.
English edition version with some silly occupation promo cards for Agricola thrown in. 
Unfortunately have to mention that something I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t notice when purchasing was that the lid had a minor bulge in the lower left corner. Can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t see it under normal light, but you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll feel it running your hands over the box. Otherwise everything else is pristine and bagged up! Please see all attached pictures. 
Shipping within the EU only for 10 EUR as this thing is such a beast. Payment by bank transfer or Paypal, but buyer covers the fees.
Thanks so much for having a look! Feel free to hit me up with any questions. </notes>

    <notes>Has been played three times in solo mode.  Contents are sorted into three small plano boxes and one large box.  Rules have been _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;read_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; and are thus a little rumply, but still in very good condition.  Everything else is great.
You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re getting the game, pre-organized.  First printing.
Shipping is the bear on this one.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a very heavy game and doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit a flat rate box.  Could be $20-30 depending on your part of the USA.</notes>

    <notes>The box is not mint, so the listing policy forces me to list this as only Good. It has a corner dent, created while  in shrink wrap, main because of the 6.5 lb weight in a thin cardboard box. 
The game is mint.
The top box lid and bottom box upper edge, has corner  damage on the lower left corner. See the pictures. As expected the slide in bottom box shows a little damage being slid together in the lid. Box was damaged while sealed. PM me if you are uncertain about pictures. Can post more, but not a whole lot more to see. 
http://is.gd/owBwM1 
Also a little bit down from the top left corner on the lid, it has a slightly raised line, runs at about a 45 degree angle that isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t very long, nor wide. You can see it on an angle under a light, one of those things once you notice it, you notice it. This would bother me, but thought I would mention it. This game is heavy, 6.5 lbs. this is a kind of game the box is going to show shelf wear, fast anyway. The game pieces just do fit the box. 
The game is mint:
The game is opened, punched, parts counted, checked and bagged, all mint, 1 mint rule book, 1 mint appendix, all unplayed. 
Extra junk in the box: 
Used rulebook, appendix.
Also included is an extra very slightly, one page aka sentence, flawed in printing, rule book, plus extra appendix. These 2 items have been read by me less then a dozen times, considering then used.
Looks like some trash about the size of a piece of rice got into the rollers during the print run.

    <notes>Opened and played maybe four times. I just think I like Agricola better, and I need to make some room in the closet. All pieces are in good condition.
You will pay for the game on paypal, then make a second paypal payment for actual shipping, box and insurance after I ship it. That way you can determine the method of delivery. Note that this sucker is heavy, at almost 8 US lbs.</notes>

    <notes>** Includes the Broken Token Caverna organizer! ** 
($35 value added)
The condition is like new in every way except for one minor thing: the box lid has a minor wrinkle on the top surface near one corner. It is only noticeable in some light conditions/angles. Very minor and not an issue for box integrity.
Shipping will probably be $17 due to the size and weight of this game, will confirm.</notes>

    <notes>From a non-smoking, no pets home.  Buyer to pay $10 S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H.  I also have some promos (Caverna Mini Expansion) I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve listed separately, so BGG gets its cut; I will combine shipping (i.e. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll only charge shipping on the base game if you buy both).
Thanks!</notes>
