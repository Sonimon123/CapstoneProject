   <description>The Great War, the latest adaptation of Richard Borg's Command _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Colours system, brings the epic battles of World War 1 to the gaming table, allowing players to portray important engagements throughout WWI history. The battles, included in the scenario booklet, focus on the historical deployment of forces and important terrain features of trench fighting in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Command card system drives movement, creates a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fog of war_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, and presents players with many interesting opportunities, while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The Combat cards add an element of suspense and will challenge players to coordinate their use in a timely manner. Overall, the battlefield tactics players will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various types of WWI units, their weapons, battlefield terrain, and written history._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this core game, the main focus is on a number of WWI trench warfare battles. However, a series of expansions, which will feature early war, Eastern Front scenarios, tanks, airplanes, other national armies, plus more special personnel figures, are already in the planning stage to enhance your WWI gaming experience._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Excellent condition with the following exceptions: box has a crack on one corner of the bottom box from shipping. Also as noted in the forums there was a problem with how the molds were designed so some of the British infantry (6 in total) lost their bayonets when I was trimming them from the sprues (check out the pictures below). This in no way effects game play and isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t noticeable once the game is set up, especially since you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t often need every infantry  unit in the scenarios. You can buy a new, individual sprue of figures if you want to replace the broken ones. I filed down all the bases of the units after clipping them so they sit flat on the board. Everything else is in excellent condition, I bought it new and played the game one time.
Each army is stored in a separate plastic container which has 18 slots, enough for each squad to have it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s own space.

    <notes>The Great War Bundle (PSC Games) - Kickstarter Version 
Base Game - Kickstarter Version 
Figures have been removed from the sprues, assembled, and stored in a Plano container. Some of the bayonets on the infantry have been broken, which seems standard for this game. Cards are stored in a baseball card holder. Tiles are in zip lock bags. Game is complete and in very good condition. Played once. Kickstarter Extras: 
2 extra scenarios exclusive to Kickstarter set 
1 Set metal command figure exclusive to Kickstarter set 
Plastic artillery guns and crews to replace the reserve artillery card tokens ( 5 British guns and crews and 5 German guns and crews) exclusive to Kickstarter core game sets. 
The 10 Pound voucher does not come with this, since it was already used to purchase the Tanks Expansion. 
Tank Expansion - Kickstarter Version 
Complete, unpunched, and in very good condition. Just removed the shrink to look at the components. Models have not been assembled. Kickstarter Extras: 
1 extra British MK IV male tank and bonus scenario 
1 extra British MK IV female tank and bonus scenario 
2 captured British MK IV male tanks (to replace captured tank card tokens). 
Raised, clear tinted perspex artillery targeting template to stand over models 
Balsa Wood in game card holder rack 
Whippets Expansion 
Complete and in very good condition. Never used. 
Would also consider a trade for a Worthington/PSC Games Reprint (Kickstarter Edition) of Hold the Line, with the French and Indian War Expansion, and the Highlander and Hessian Miniature Packs.</notes>

    <notes>I got this game new, but due to bad packing the box was pretty beat up.  Corners all ripped etc.  I was able to tape up the box, it is in one piece but looks like an old game in a closet.  The pieces are all in like new condition.  I punched the cardboard and opened the cards.  The Several of the plastic soldiers were damaged when I inspected them, I contacted PSC and they sent me an entire new set.  Those are all still attached to the plastic model holders.  I will be happy to send pics upon request, just GM me. Box is big so shipping will be higher than a square box game.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Kickstarter version of The Great War and it comes with all of the wonderful painted minis.  It also comes with the unpainted ones as well.  When it originally shipped, they sent the game with unpainted minis because the painted ones weren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ready.  I received them later.  The cards and cardboard are unpunched, and the painted minis came punched and they are all contained in small plastic boxes inside the big box.  Some of the unpainted minis broke when I punched them from the sprews...and some are still on the sprews.  Of course, these are all extras, so should be no issue.  
This is a fantastic price for this game with _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;painted_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; miniatures!</notes>

    <notes>Like new condition/ no dings or dents on box. This game was opened and I began to break down the figures without a tool to cut them out and one of the figures broke. I called PSC who immediately replaced the trays so there are two extra trays of figures. Anyway, the rest of the game is unpunched and the cards are still in the shrink.  Shipping on this item is $15 anywhere USA.
*It is strongly recommended you obtain a mini wire cutting tool to take the figures out. If you use your hands to rock them back and forth (like I did) you will break them. Please Email with any questions.</notes>
