   <description>Breaking Away is a luck-free race game based on cycling. Players control a team of four cyclists. For each cyclist the player chooses one of his available movement allowances and moves that many squares. Once all cyclists have moved, the expended movement allowances are replaced with new ones calculated according to the cyclist's position in the peloton; being at the back of a group brings a high replacement value, and being at the front a low one._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Sprint points are earned by being among the first eight to cross the sprint lines so there is always a trade-off between slipstreaming (_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;drafting_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;) the other riders in order to build up high movement allowances and making a break for the front to be the first to cross the finish line._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Note: The first edition from Fiendish Games comes with six teams, but additional teams can be ordered to allow for games with up to twelve people; the additional colors are orange, pink, purple, brown, silver, and gold.

    <notes>Everything in nice shape (even the poor quality box... :). 
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.30€ worldwide and 8.20€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Breaking Away - Fiendish Games
Very Good / Like New! The game did not come in shrink wrap, and is still unplayed. Stickers have not been applied to the riders. There is some shelfware, but otherwise the game is in excellent condition. Pictures available upon request.
Buyer to pay exact shipping costs plus $2.00 handling charge.

    <notes>The game is new.  I purchased it last year directly from Fiendish Games.  It was not shrinkwrapped. 
I actually received it in a shipping envelope that included all game parts and a game box that had not been assembled.
As a bonus, I am including an additional team.

    <notes>Your chance to take advantage of the publisher_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s indolence! If the dollar continues to decline, the US price of this game will surely go up but will I remember to alter the price on BoardGameGeek?  
In case you had not realised, this is for a copy of the game direct from the designer. Price is $38 and shipping is included in the price.  Please allow up to 28 days for delivery (though we strive for 14) if ordering from outside Europe.</notes>

    <notes>Breaking Away by Fiendish Games
Box:  Box is a rather dismal white corrugated cardboard affair with poorly-applied stickers.  Box top and bottom also appear to be exactly the same size, so box top has one partially split corner and some bowing along all box sides.
Components:  Comes with extra riders for a total of 12 teams!  Stickers to distinguish riders all fell off within about 10 seconds of starting the first game, so riders have little helmets painted on them (white, yellow, green, and black).  Remaining components are complete and in like new condition!  
SHIPPING:
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 2 lbs. from zip code 85208.  International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me before buying for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in excellent condition, has been handled with TLC
My late husband was an avid board gamer and game collector.  Sadly the time has come for me to find new homes for all his games. (Except my favorites :) )  He took excellent care of all his games, no eating or drinking allowed while playing a game.  He had a huge collection, and most of his games had never even been played.  Feel free to message me with any questions or concerns.   Thank you!</notes>
