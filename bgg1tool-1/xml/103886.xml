   <description>It is a dark time for the galaxy. The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy. In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations. From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Yet not all hope is lost. The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire. Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion. And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects. The Rebels win by destroying three dark side objectives before the Empire wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Opened and played once. I picked this up at the FFG World_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Tournament but am not interested in picking up another LCG.
Just to be clear, this is not a pre-order, I have the game in my hand ready to ship.
I would be interested in $60 but that includes free shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d take it as either paypal or a gift card to CoolStuffInc or MinatureMarket. If you send me the gift card I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll donate the 3% to BGG so it still gets it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cut. </notes>

    <notes>I will send this game to the eventual buyer using the Collect Plus courier service. It will be tracked and needs to be signed for upon receipt. Details can be found at www.collectplus.co.uk.
Post and packing costs will be:
£6.00 delivered to your door, OR
£4.50 delivered to your nearest participating dealer for you to collect. (I recommend this, as you do not have to wait in for delivery. An email is sent when it is ready to be collected.)
Some places within the UK may have to pay additional postage charges. I will contact you if this is the case. If this does apply you are probably more aware of this than me.
European destinations, as listed by Royal Mail, will be £12.00.

    <notes>You are buying a complete Star Wars the card game core set. Every card is sleeved in clear sleeves (not sure the brand but they are very nice). I will also include enough sleeves for a second core set. 
The game looks and smells new. It has never been played and even the tokes have yet to be punched out. 
I will ship the item USPS Priority Mail in a flat rate box. I will charge $10 for shipping. Which is a little less then the  price of shipping.
Let me know if you have any questions.</notes>

Included are also one pack of each of the Star Wars art sleeves from Fantasy Flight Games with Palpatine, light-saber, Star Wars, and the Empire Strikes Back art on them.  There is also red and blue Ultra-Pro sleeves included and Ultra-Pro deck boxes.  I also have thrown in some EA cards and plastic tokens from the Organized Play kits from season 1 put out by FFG.
The cards are opened and two decks have been assembled and sleeved but none of the cards have ever been used.  Everything is brand-new and well taken care of.  I have all of the boxes from the core sets and deluxe sets ready to be shipped as well.</notes>

    <notes>Everything you need to dive in fully at a great price. Includes 2 Core sets, 1 balance of the force, 1 edge of darkness, all packs from the Hoth Cycle, all packs from Echoes of the Force Cycle, Dragon brand Red and blue sleeves on 4 of the good decks I built, and also the card organizer for sleeved cards from Broken token. Each faction is in numeric order too, based on the number on the bottom right. Take advantage of this great deal. All of this retails well over $300. I have all the boxes if you want them, however everything fits in the one core and that is the plan to ship unless requested.</notes>

    <notes>This is for one copy of the cards from the base game, Edge of Darkness, The Desolation of Hoth, The Search for Skywalker, A Dark Time,  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Assault on Echo Base. Included are the original box (pretty beat up) with the Broken Token sleeved card insert and token organizer; over 1000 extra sleeves; and tokens if desired.  I could print a rulebook to include if desired, but the original was a casualty of consolidation a long time ago.
It is listed in good condition as the cards are sleeved and have never seen naked play. 
This is a great way for a new player to expand their collection.
Shipping would be USPS from 21222.
The pictures below show the worst of the scuffing on the exterior of the box and the contents.</notes>

    <notes>For sale is a collection of Star Wars: The Card Game by Fantasy Flight Games. This listing includes all cards from the core set x2, Edge of Darkness deluxe expansion x2, Balance of the Force deluxe expansion, the complete Hoth cycle and Echoes of the Force cycle. Most cards have been played lightly, sleeved in UltraPro sleeves - red _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; black for the Dark Side, blue _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; white for the Light Side. Last five packs of Echoes of the Force are unopened. The main collection is housed in an original core box with insert, and arranged by objective sets with dividers printed from Boardgame Geek. Also included is an UltraPro Satin Tower deck box in black, perfect for taking to a tournament - room for two standard decks in the top and all the fiddly bits (shield, focus _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; damage tokens, plus the Death Star dial and Balance token) fitting in the bottom compartment. The card box with Vader on it is from one of the early game day kits - I actually got it as a prize at the Star Wars Game Experience event at FFG in May of 2013, for coming in dead last in the tournament. :-) There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s room in there for 4 more standard decks in boxes, plus the oversized Death Star dial from Balance of the Force, plus a little extra room for, well, extras. I keep a few unused sleeves in there. Another extra is a program from the aforementioned Game Experience, with a couple of articles on deckbuilding and other content on X-Wing and the Edge of the Empire RPG. The tuckboxes for the decks were all made by me using scanned art and an online tuckbox generator, back when I actually had time to do such things. Nowadays I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t even find the time to play the game, hence the sale. Each box holds a standard 60-card sleeved deck with room for a few extra cards. Sharp eyed viewers will also notice that the Focus tokens in the picture are acrylic, another game day kit from somewhere in the past.There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a little plastic bag with the extra tokens that won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the Satin Tower. Included is the unpunched token sheet from the second core set, an additional rule book, and the rule sheets for Edge of Darkness and Balance of the Force. Because of the weight and bulk I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m charging $10 for shipping. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m sure it will cost more but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m willing to cover it.</notes>

This lot of Star Wars: The Card Game has been played only a few times before I moved and lost my player base.  All cards, tokens, and game boxes are in factory condition and have been stored in a pet-free _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; smoke-free home. Unfortunately due to lack of use I am thinning my board game collection, so I decided to put the game up for sale.  If you are looking to get into Star Wars: The Card Game, this is an economical way to do so.
Shipping and handling will cost $16.00 and will be shipped out the following business day after confirmation of payment via paypal. A tracking number will be provided once the package has been shipped.
If you have any additional questions feel free to send me a message via BGG. I also offer free pickup if the buyer is located in Rochester, NY.</notes>
