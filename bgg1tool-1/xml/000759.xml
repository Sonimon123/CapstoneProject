   <description>Turning Point: Stalingrad is mid-complexity wargame on the battle of Stalingrad during World War 2. Attackers from the German 6th Army must dislodge the Russian 62nd Army and take the city of Stalingrad before the commencement of Operation Uranus. If the city could be taken, German troops could then be re-deployed to reinforce the Italian and Rumanian formations holding the flanks of along the Volga. The fiasco at Stalingrad can then be prevented._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game is an operational level treatment of the actual streetfighting. Each turn is a day comprising of a variable number of daylight and night impulses. Units are battalions and armoured units representing AFVs in platoon and company strength. The map is on a scale of 1 inch to 500 metres, depicting the city of Stalingrad and its western approaches, divided into 74 areas divided according to terrain features, and rated for defensive suitability. Victory is determined by the number of objectives captured by the German player each week. If it exceeds the requirements for the week, he wins. If not the Russian player wins. If it is equal to the victory requirement, the game is extended by another week, with a different(higher) victory objective requirement._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game comprises two 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; by 16_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; mounted mapboards, counters, rules and charts._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Breakout: Normandy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

------------------------
Due to high shipping costs and general amount of paper work involved, I am limiting the sale on this game to US only.
This game is listed as part of a group that I am selling to benefit the Sun Tzu Military History Museum.
The games were owned by friend who passed this past January, and he wanted to make sure his games were
sold to benefit his charity of choice.  
Many of the games have rules underlining, which I have tried to catalog in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s condition.  I have also 
tried to give as complete and accurate description as possible.  Games are complete, unless otherwise noted.  A few of the older games may have handmade
replacement counters.  Again, I have tried to identify these items in the game description.  If you are concerned about specifics of condition that are not in the game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s description, please geekmail me, and I will give a very specific accounting of whatever
you may have questions on.
For any games that are missing pieces, I heartily recommend checking the BGG Spare Parts 2012 wanted/have geeklist.  Several users of this site have been very generous in helping find missing components!  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/76707/2012-spare-parts-resource-list
Prices are firm on single purchases, but I will consider offers on multiple games.  I will ship multiple purchases together to try and save you money on shipping.
Photos are available upon request!
Local pickup available in the Denver Metro area.  I live in South West Aurora and we can meet at a place that makes sense. </notes>

    <notes>Game is mostly in great shape and verified complete. Box is square and in good shape too. Game has a couple of substitute counters and units have been color-coded with a highlighter to show what division they belong to. This greatly aids play. If you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re looking for a copy to play this one is a deal. </notes>

the box does show signs of shelf wear, has scuff marks at the corners and the top right hand corner side is split. However, for all that the box is still sturdy and functional.
Please contact me for shipping costs. I pack very safely and securely.

Game has been handled with  TLC.  My late husband was an avid boardgamer, and like to play almost as much as he liked to collect them.  He took excellent care of all of his games.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get a chance to play them all, but if he did play them, no food or drink was allowed near the game.  All games have been stored in a pet free, non smoking environment.  Please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t hesitate to ask if there are any questions.  Thank you!</notes>

    <notes>This has Second Edition rules. Games has never been played. Counters are punched but about 1/2 remain connected ( not all counters are totally loose and separate from each other).  Box cover has one corner that split, this has been reaped. Everything in clean, like new condition otherwise. No stains, no odors, even the reply card is still there! Game is from my personal collection, I have been the only owner.

    <notes>The game is UNpunched and was never played. The box has some light dishing and is slightly bowed out. The first three and a half pages of the rules have been highlighted.  There is also some underlining, mostly on the first page and a half of the rules.  The first page or so of the rules is messy.  Otherwise they are legible.  You may want to obtain a copy of the first page or two of the rules online.  All components are present.  (please see photos).
Bonus:  The game includes a copy of Volume 26, #2 of the General Magazine.  This magazine has articles about the game. 
Please E-mail me if you have any questions about the game.
The game will be shipped within 1 to 2 business days after receiving payment via PayPal, Money Order or Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Check. Thank you for reviewing my listing.
I will ship the game by using a USPS Priority Mail medium flat rate box at a cost of $13.45.</notes>
