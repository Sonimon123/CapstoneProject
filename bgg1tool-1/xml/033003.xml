Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one.

Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.

The Caucasus Campaign is a quick playing, moderately complex game with large hexes and easy-viewing 5/8 counters. The game system is based on the classic Igo-Ugo/movement-combat-exploitation system, but modified 
with elements from Ardennes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;44 (specifically: Determined Attacks and Defense and unit morale). The tournament scenario (6 turns) can be completely in roughly 2 hours. The full game is 14 turns long and can be finished in one sitting (approximately 5 hours).</notes>

    <notes>Never played, not completely punched.
My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play all of the games, however if they were played they were gently played.  No food or drinks around his games!  No way, no how!!!  Stored in a smoke free environment.  He passed away in 2012, it is time to find a new home for his games. Thank you!</notes>
