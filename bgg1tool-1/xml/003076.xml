   <description>In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Trader_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; or _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Builder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Builder_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;governor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;large buildings._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; The Nobles.   These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with Buildings and Nobles expansions included), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This item is NEW and still in its original shrink wrap.
Buyer pays shipping costs (choice of USPS First Class or Priority Mail.) Insurance is optional but always recommended. I will contact you with the amount but it is based on what I pay to ship the item to you plus $1 handling (to cover boxes, tape, packing peanuts, and so on.) I do not believe in overcharging for shipping.
PA Residents will be charged 6% sales tax.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to order something I do not currently have listed as I can special order a variety of BGG favorites and provide them to you at a great discount.
I also have the expansion for this game available for purchase. </notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game as part of a fund raising event. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m going to donate the proceeds from all games I sell to either CWAC(Children with AIDS Charity) or Project Self Sufficiency NJ. Both are very worthy causes and while I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much to give, evey little bit helps.
Puerto Rico is in great shape.  The game has only been played a few times.  Everything is bagged nicely and has been well taken care of.  Shipping will be $6.00 and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship as fast as possible for that price.</notes>

    <notes>The players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops: Corn, Indigo, Coffee, Sugar and Tobacco, they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors; growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.
The game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is their turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round. The player who selects the best roles to advance their position during the game will win.

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 195)
Prospector, captain, mayor, trader, settler, craftsman, or builder? Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations? Will you build the most valuable buildings? You have but one goal achieve the greatest prosperity. The players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops corn, indigo, coffee, sugar and tobacco, they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors, growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time and most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit. A novel game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is their turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round. The player who selects the best roles to advance their position during the game will win. One of the most popular eurogames. Brilliant mechanics. Everyone plays all the time. </notes>

    <notes>Puerto Rico plus Treasure Chest Expansions _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; FIMO GOODNESS!
THIS ITEM IS RESERVED FOR Kytty
Thanks for bidding on my Ninja Meeple Awareness auction item. Every bit helps me to fight back versus those little wooden eurowarriors.
Please confirm this purchase and when you get the total invoice amount plus *shipping, please send payment to me via paypal @ diehard4life@gmail.com
*NOTE: if you have a non-residential address (work, etc.) please be sure to use it to ship to. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll save you a couple of bucks (unless you won something small enough to fit in a USPS SMALL flat rate box) because I use FedEx Ground for 90% of my shipments because it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s cheaper than USPS, with better handling. You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get $100 insurance and real-time tracking included at no additional charge.
Thanks again, and peace.

    <notes>Rio Grande First Edition (2002) with Puerto Rico Expansion (2003) included. Game components and instruction manual are in very good condition; game was played only three or four times. Box-top bulges ever-so-slightly due to other games being stacked on top of it. Expansion pieces are unpunched and rules  are included.
Buyer pays actual shipping costs based on zip/postal code. Let me know your preferred shipping method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you  a quote.</notes>

    <notes>This game is in excellent condition (only been played 2 or 3 times).  
The only reason I set the condition on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is we are missing one of the brown disks (representing colonists), but I have replaced it with disk made of brown clay (from my days of making pieces to go with Agricola).  Also, there is a slight dent in one corner of the box.  Otherwise, everything is in great condition.</notes>

Game pieces are stored in baggies and a Plano box (no box insert, not sure if there was one originally).  If you want the Plano box, please add $3, otherwise I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll transfer the contents to a baggie.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components.  
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST PLUS USD$5.00 (sorry, it is a much bigger hassle on my end, plus I need to provide the box). Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).</notes>

    <notes>Going along with my most recent sales, this is a copy of a new in box copy of Puerto Rico. This is another game I bought, but due to having little kids I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had no time to play. Rather than hanging on to it for some other time, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d rather see this go to someone who could get some real fun and value out of it.
Shipping with be $12.35 to anywhere in the US- that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s USPS priority mail flat rate- my actual cost. That gets you really fast shipping, insurance and tracking. If you are in the loop of Chicago I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to have you come grab it for no shipping.
Also, if you want some of the other games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m listing I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to work with you on shipping and possibly bulk discounts for buying more than one game from me.
Thanks!

Includes a printout for the rules for the first expansion, as well as the two-player variant. Includes color paper printouts of the first expansion buildings (two copies in fact, one on quite thick stock paper) which works just fine.

My husband was an avid board gamer/collector.  He loved his games and took excellent care of them!  If they were played, we no food or drink was allowed.  Smoke free environment...   He passed away in 2012 and it is time for the games to find new homes.  Thank you!</notes>

This game has been played a few times, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s complete and in great condition. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m the original owner.
The box has some wear from being on shelves for a few years (I used to have more time to play games).
Would love for this to go to a good home where it will be played and enjoyed!</notes>
