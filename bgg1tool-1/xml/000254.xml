    <notes>This is the Avalon Hill version.  The box top shows major wear, and the bottom two corners are split.  However, the inside components are in very good condition.  The pieces are all punched and bagged, but I did not count them to see if every one of them is there.  However, all the countersheet frames are included, so you can double-check to see if anything is missing (sold as is).  All the original inserts are also included.</notes>

    <notes>Box has a lot of scuffing, but is otherwise in good shape with no split corners. The game is missing 8 counters. They are:
1 Turkish _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; Unit
1 Austrian Political Status Marker
1 Austrian Economic Status Marker
1 (of three) Austrian Victory Point (+/-) Marker
All four Austrian Generals
Their stats are: 
         Mack: 1.3.4.A
      Charles: 4.4.6.B
         John: 1.1.2.C
Schwarzenberg: 2.2.3.C
Now I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t poured through the rules to see if having replacement counters for these would in ANY WAY effect the game, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m inclined to doubt that it would be an issue.

    <notes>Rating should be better than good as the game has never been played - everything there, all counters unpunched, but box shows some wear and it looks like the rulebook has tasted some coffee once..
Shipping at actual cost dependend on destination, total weight and method of shipment chosen.
Usually shipping a single (regular sized) boardgame (surface) costs 12.90€ worldwide and 8.60€ within Europe. Smaller games ship cheaper. Of course multiple games can be combined.

    <notes>Box is in okay condition: some scuffing and such but not too bad. Counters are unpunched, the maps look good and clean. I likely never bothered too much with this one because -urghh- the rulebook is missing. I see that the rules are available online. Other than that, the box contents are very very clean.</notes>

    <notes>This game is complete, and looks like only a single scenario has been played.  Counters come partially punched: many more still in the sprues, the rest in plastic baggies.  The map is in very good shape, all charts and tables clean and present.  The rules booklet somewhat more heavily used.  Staples have been removed, but the whole booklet is intact and whole.  The box shows minor scuffing and some sun fading, but all corners intact.  Business reply card and game catalog from 1986 present.  Please write with any questions.</notes>

    <notes>This is the original 1983 large box edition by Australian Design Group. The game is punched and complete, but has never been played, so the components are in excellent shape. 
The box has some wear and creasing. One of the box sides is split and has been repaired with clear tape.</notes>

Good News: Unpunched, this is the ADG version with a little heavier cardstock map than the Avalon Hill version.
Bad News: Box taped and not in too good a shape, the ADG rulebook is less colorful than the AH one.
The picture shows the actual game offered.
I ask you only to pay actual shipping cost.  Even better, come by and pick it up, maybe we can figure out how to play this awesome game over Vassal!

    <notes>Gamebox is in good condition, but with a damaged corner and some shelfwear(see photo). The counters have been punched, verified to be all present, most have been trimmed and are organized in bags.  To more easily distinguish the different corp counters the back of the counters have been colored with their national colors (see photo).  The maps, rules and charts are in very good condition except for the Minor Power chart that has some discoloration. The game has not been exposed to and is free of any odors.

    <notes>Empires in Arms is a high complexity strategy game published by Avalon Hill in 1986. It is the Avalon Hill Game Company’s trademark for its game of Napoleonic Diplomacy and Warfare.
Included in this is an expansion: Viva La Revolution which consists of 15 leader counters. There is also included a photo copy of the rules from the General magazine, Volume 25, issue 4.
The game is complete and in good condition. The box shows moderate shelf wear. The rules are in good shape but do show some yellowing around the spine. All charts are in very good shape. All charts have written on them “G. Milks”. The two maps are clean and in excellent shape. The counters are cleanly punched and sorted into two counter trays. The counter tray lids are taped onto the bottoms to reduce the amount of counters shifting during shipping. The two dice are clean and ready for rolling.
The complete list of components are:

1 x 4 photocopied pages from General Magazine covering the Viva La Revolution expansion

Dwolla or Paypal preferred (Paypal adds 3%), personal check in US funds drawn on a US bank OK, but I will ship only when check clears. Seller pays shipping/handling (I will charge for actually calculated shipping rates but no more than $12.50 in the US. Canada: will have to find shipping charges and will charge actual shipping fees).</notes>

this is a very good copy and everything is in great shape, however, the maps are hard laminated and i cannot come up with a way to realistically ship them ?   i think there are files available now to make your own, or you can pay for shipping, or you can pick them up locally or at a future bgg.con
Please geekmail me with any questions.

    <notes>This is the much superior ADG first edition in the big box.
Game is punched and sorted in plastic counter tray.
The heavy stock coated maps are as new, as are the counters. There are several sheets of errata from ADG. The rulebook has no writing in it but shows signs of having been read and has one very small stain on the front cover.
Box is square in in the best shape I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ever seen for this game, though it does have a small ding on the upper right corner and the paper has bubbled a bit. No shelf wear at all that I can see.
I also have a punched Avalon Hill version for $20 less. Geekmail me if interested.</notes>

    <notes>Overall in Acceptable condition. The game is missing 5 counters. (I have a note from way back indicating the ones that are missing.)
The box is in Fair condition. It has shelf wear, tape marks, some small stains, etc. There are no split corners and it is not dished.
The map boards are in Very Good condition.
The rule book is in Good condition. Some minor staining.
All of the charts are also in Good condition.
The counters are in Good to Fair condition. Some of the counters are _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;dirty_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;. Not sure what caused it. Many of the counters are still held together, but they are NOT in the original frames anymore.</notes>

    <notes>Good condition.  (I rate strictly based on the criteria BGG has set up)
The good:
Box is still strong, not dented or pushed in.
Game is unpunched and unplayed.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think the map has even been laid flat.
The annoying:
Box: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;For ages 8 and up_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; sticker on front, half-peeled price tag over bar code on back, one 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; minor crease on the front to the side, two 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; pieces of clear tape, each partially on a side and mostly on the back and cut in between, and one side has a 3/4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; square where the paint has been removed when the aforementioned clear tape was removed.
Game: 4 out of the 1008 (unpunched) counters have a slight mildew spot.  The mildew has been killed with isopropyl alcohol, and the spots just look like a little smudge of light dirt, and don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t impede the use of the counters.
I will add pictures in the next day or two.
Can do face-to-face handoff in the Washington DC area.
From non-smoking house with just 1 pet, a poodle-cocker spaniel mix (doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t shed or play boardgames).
Discounts for multiple games in a purchase: $2 off all but most expensive game, will combine shipping. [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=pdahl]Click to see my other games for sale[/url]

    <notes>Game is mostly in very good condition - of course there is a lot of shelfwear - esspecially at the backside of the box.  All the Playeraids for the countries are there and  in very good condition, just on the austrian playeraid is a little smudge ( look at the picture) 
The game is otherwise very clean and does not smell. (Well, might sound strange, but I made bad experiences with old stinky or mouldy games)
seems that the maps, wich are overall in very good condition have  been pleated allready very often and show therefore (very!) minor damage on one inner edge (view example -below corfu) but that is really very small in size. - but hey - this monster is 31 years old - probably older than you!!! :o)
There is some extra stuff in it for the geek in you: Some printed strategy guides and proposals for optional rules and a photocopy (?) of extra counters from the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;general_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;-magazine. 
I think that you can have fun with this version for the next 15 Years at least if you take a bit care for the components - that means, you have enpough time for one full campaign!!! :-)</notes>

My late husband collected board games, he didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t play all of them, but he sure liked to collect.  If game was played, he took excellent care, no food or drink allowed near his games.  The time has come to find new homes for his precious games. :)  Hoping that they will all go to board game enthusiasts like him.  Please feel free to ask any questions.  I will try to answer.  Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>From memory, the game is unplayed as we used someone else_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy. The box is a little shelf-worn and the staples on the rules have rusted but all the charts _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; map are in vgc.
The counters are in a tray, except for the national strength counters which are bagged and most of the neutral strength counters, mostly still unpunched.
I also have copies of the two articles _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; errata in General 23.4; the counters from General 25.2 and a copy of the article in General 25.4 that provides the rules for them.

    <notes>Original Avalon edition of the game.
Box shows little wear. Actually the condition should be better than _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;very good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; since the game has never been played with. Counters have been carefully punched and sorted in plastic trays (which are included). Otherwise never played.</notes>

Between 15 and 30 euros for Europe.

Payment:  PayPal or Bank transfer(fees on buyer)
Note: When I send you a money order via PayPal, I will include 0,35 Euros +3,4% over the money asked as this is the average fee that PayPal is charging over every transaction. More if applicable. The reason I do this is because the BGG Marketplace takes a 3% fee and PayPal takes ~4% fee plus other fees when you ask for the money to be sent to your account.</notes>
