   <description>One of the first releases from Avalon Hill games under Hasbro. A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp;A: Europe uses the same system as the original Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies, although now the focus of the game in on the European theater of WWII. Two new units have been added to the game (destroyers and artillery) and there are some modifications to the rules and overall strategic scenario._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Shipping cost is approximately the cost for a 5-lb package from 48104 to your zip code. I ship via USPS (Priority and Parcel) and FedEx Home/Ground.  Because it is a heavy item, depending on your distance from Ann Arbor, MI, FedEx could be a cheaper option here.</notes>

    <notes>Very nice shape, no issues, played a few times. Should be a 4 pound package from zip 80015, but actual weight might vary by a pound at most after packing. I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge for packing/handling, and I ship USPS Priority by the lowest rate, which is often Flat Rate, but sometimes games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in those boxes.

    <notes>NOTE: You will need a base edition of Axis _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Allies (preferably  AH edition for destroyers and artillery) to play this because it does not come with the box, plastic pieces, or dice.  You will receive the game board, rules, and battle mat.  I also have A_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;A Pacific in the same condition and would not charge additional shipping if both were bought.

    <notes>I consider this game to be in very good condition, however one vertical edge of the box lid was split even before unwrapping the shrink so by BGG standards I must describe it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. Everything else looks perfect. There is insignificant shelf wear visible upon close box inspection. This game has been played perhaps 8 times. I expect shipping to cost around $15 but will check with the post office once I know your shipping location.</notes>

    <notes>I had to change it to acceptable due to the fact that it is missing 3 pieces. Played once by me. (I think I bought it used myself). No one wanted to be the Nazis, so away it goes. Great shape, I finally got off my butt to count the pieces. There are 366 in total. There are supposed to be 369. I counted 95 U.S.; 89 German; 85 UK; 73 Russian and 24 grey Factories, AA guns.  I am only charging $12. for shipping via parcel post.  The box is great, instructions and cards are there, everything else other than missing three pieces seems very good to me. </notes>

    <notes>Condition - Not in shrink wrap but unpunched, unplayed, with box and all components in new condition.
Payment by PayPal in advance or cash on pickup.
For shipping this is considered a very large size game.
The following options are available for delivery within the continental United States:
1) Local pickup in the San Jose, California area (no cost)
2) USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate - $6.60 (small), $12.65 (medium), or $17.15 (large), depending on game size. Generally very small games fit in the small box, small or medium in the medium box, and large in the large box. Box fits for some games are very snug, allowing minimal protective padding - if this shipping option is picked for such games seller assumes no responsibility for damage during transit.
3) USPS Parcel Select Ground / Non-Flat Rate Priority - varies, usually only cheaper than Flat Rate Priority for small and very light weight games (under 2 pounds), an additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs.
4) FedEx Ground - varies, usually from $12 for short distance shipments of light weight games to $30 for heavy games (or multiple games up to 10 pounds) long distance shipments. This is usually the cheapest option for very large games. An additional fee of $3.25 for the box and packing materials will be added to the shipping costs. While expensive, this is the best method if damage during transit is a concern, as all items will be packed in boxes sufficiently sized for protective materials. Shipping rates to Alaska or Hawaii will be higher for FedEx.
Games will not be shipped by any method other than a shipping box, nor unboxed or in less than complete condition, please do not ask.</notes>
