   <description>Players explore the ruins of Castle Dragonfire trying to reach the treasure chamber in the center of the dungeon and escape alive with as much treasure as possible. A limited number of turns before the game ends puts pressure on players to take risks and score rewards because anyone left in the dungeon when time runs out dies! A tile-laying system creates the maze-like dungeon and ensures that no two games are ever exactly the same._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Originally published as Drakborgen (Dragon's Keep) in 1985 by Alga, a subsidiary of BRIO AB. Sold in Norway (Skatten i borgen) and Denmark (Drageborgen). Licenced to Germany (Schmidt Spiele) as Drachenhort, to Great Britain (Games Workshop) as DungeonQuest. A 2nd edition named Drakborgen Legenden was released in 2002 (never released outside Sweden). The game was re-licensed to FFG in 2010, who released the 3rd edition the same year.

    <notes>Dungeonquest plus BOTH Heroes and Catacomb eexpansions.
Mostly Complete!
My copy has the original boxes for the base game and the catacombs expansion (heroes mixed in, no box) and both show 
shelfwear. The games appear complete except I have NONE OF THE FIGURES for any of the sets. All tiles, cards, etc are present as best as I can tell from the rulebooks itemized breakdown. 
E-mail with any questions.

    <notes>This is an old classic, and one of the hardest games I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve ever played. The game is in pretty good condition, but it is missing one of the little cones used to track hitpoints. This only matters if playing with all characters, and can be easily replaced. Everything else is there and in good shape.</notes>

    <notes>*Includes the Heroes for DungeonQuest expansion as well as DungeonQuest*
This is for a playable but clearly flawed copy of DungeonQuest and its Heroes expansion.
Here_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the bad news: *No figures, for either the base game or for the expansion, are included.*  In addition, 3 of the 115 room tiles are missing, and 1 of the 8 dragon tiles (sleeping) is gone. Some of the included room tiles were printed a bit off center.  Similarly, some of the treasure counters were off center.  Those have their values written on their backs, so their amount will be legible.  And instead of the original rulebook from Heroes for Dungeonquest, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including a copy. (Yes, these are the reasons the price is low.)
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s playable with the missing tiles, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll include a disk of good scans of the missing tiles as well as well centered versions of the off-centered tiles, if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re feeling ambitious.  (They were done by the person I got the game from, who had an extra copy.)
Okay, now on to more standard wear:
The board pieces are clean and in good to very good condition.  The many cards (room, search, crypt, corpse, door, monster, trap, ring, spell, and sundry others) are all clean and in good condition.  The hero cards are in fair to good condition -- They_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re completely clean, but a few of them (Volrik, Ulv, Sir Rohan, and Rildo) have slightly bent corners. Even the combat cards are in fair to good condition -- They show light dirt and wear on the edges.  The counters (ring, dragon, treasure, combat) and tiles are also clean and in good condition, except for the missing and off center counters mentioned, above.
The main game rulebook and reference sheet are in very good condition.  As mentioned above, the Heroes rulebook is a photocopy. The dice and various counters (except the miniatures!) are all present.  The box bottom shows very heavy wear, especially at the corners and edges. There are small breaks in the paper on two of the corners, and a ~2 inch long paper split along one edge.  The box top shows heavy wear -- Wear is very heavy at the bottom corners and moderate to heavy on the edges.  The front picture shows moderate wear.  One corner of the box top was apparently split at some point, but was neatly reglued.
Okay, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m done describing, now.  Please contact me if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like anything clarified or photographed!
The shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>This is for Dungeonquest (original 1985 edition) + Heroes of Dungeonquest + Catacombs.  The only things missing are: the box for Catacombs, the Berzerk card/token from Heroes (easily replaced with just about anything), the metal miniature for Ironhand the Mighty, and the original 4 plastic warriors from Dungeonquest (easily replaced with any other miniatures, including heroes minis.)  NONE of these affect gameplay at all.  The heroes minis are all painted, and quite well too.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m also including a handsewn drawstring bag to pull tiles from, some Dragon Strike and Heroquest monster pieces, and a couple other painted figures.  Photos available on request.  </notes>

    <notes>1st edition. Game has been played but in good condition overall. Box lid is very slightly dished and has one split corner. I have not taped it. One of the room tiles needs to be remounted on chipboard. Other than that, game is in good condition considering its age. I do not accept Paypal for payment. If you want to pay online, you can use Amazon Payments. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s easy and free to sign up and they don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t charge fees.

    <notes>Includes...
[thing=1746][/thing]
and
[thing=1745][/thing]
...both in the base game box. Expansion boxes not included.
The figures are unpainted and unattached to the bases. Helena_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s shield is included, but unattached. Only includes 10 of the 12 plastic bases, but they are only standard cheap bases.
All other components are included. The components are in generally very good condition, but there is a bit of wear on some of the corners of the cards and slight tear or two, but nothing that hinders play.
The box shows standard wear for a 30 year old game (whitening along the edges, fading on the front and back, but everything is still very legible). One corner on the box top is starting to split, but the box is quite sturdy.</notes>
