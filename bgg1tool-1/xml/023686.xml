Hottest Party Game of the Year
GiftTRAP is the Secret Santa of Board Games. Exchanging gifts has never been so much fun. If you’ve never created and shared your “Bucket List” with your friends and family this game is for you. More than a dozen international awards let you know this game is a great time waiting to happen. It’s got great replay value and a very broad appeal.  Search the web for hundreds of independent reviews supporting the reputation of this highly innovative and unique game. 
It’s the hilarious social conversation starter that will get you and your friends talking “off topic” about all sorts of stuff. Build, share and compare your own personal “Bucket List” as you play. 
Despite there being hundreds of party games, it’s rare to find one that adults and children both LOVE playing. 
Unlike other party games you don’t need skills in drawing, acting or trivia so it works well when you have a crowd of mixed ages/skills. 
Winning praise and attention globally

    <notes>Hi there!
Up for sale is GiftTRAP. I have limited closet space and need to sell some games. These are games that are in near-new condition, never been played. The theme didnt click with my gaming group, so we never actually played it. They come from a smoke-free, adult home with no kids and no pets. I take absolute meticulous care of all my board games. I do not allow friends to eat and drink while playing these games. Hopefully they can find a home in your inventory where they_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be played and loved :)
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m new to BGG, so I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have much feedback, but you can check my eBay account (x.metal), which has over 820 feedback with no negatives. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping for multiple items.
Send me a geekmail if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!</notes>

    <notes>GiftTRAP won a special Spiel des Jahres prize in 2009, and was voted _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Best Party Game of the Year_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by Games Magazine in 2008, proving that while buying real gifts can be traumatic, giving virtual gifts to find out how people really feel is heaps of fun. Be prepared for some surprises!
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a conversation starter that will get you and your friends talking about things that matter. Unlike other party games you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need skills in drawing, acting or trivia, so it works well when you have a crowd of mixed ages/skills.
