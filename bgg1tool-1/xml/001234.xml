   <description>Once Upon A Time is a game in which the players create a story together, using cards that show typical elements from fairy tales. One player is the Storyteller and creates a story using the ingredients on their cards. They try to guide the plot towards their own ending. The other players try to use cards to interrupt the Storyteller and become the new Storyteller. The winner is the first player to play out all their cards and end with their Happy Ever After card._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The second edition, published in 1995, features an expanded card set._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The third edition, published in 2012, features multiple changes, including new artwork by Omar Rayyan, a new card set, and a simplified rulesheet._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;See Also_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    Dark Cults_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

* Second edition. The cards have been used very little and are in excellent condition. The very flimsy box has wear. This is the one being sold for $8.
* First edition. This has black and white cards, which I think are better-designed than the second edition cards. However, they are not of as good quality. They have not been used but some have very faint surface scuffing. Also, two of the story cards might be missing (there are 106, the box says 108, but I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s correct). The box is in poor shape.

    <notes>Atlas Games (ATG1030)
Tell your own fantastic tales of brave heroes and daring adventure! Once Upon a Time is the award-winning storytelling card game that encourages creativity and collaborative play. One player is the Storyteller, and begins telling a story using the fairytale elements on her Story cards, guiding the plot toward her Ending Card. The other players use their own cards to interrupt her and become the new Storyteller. The winner is the first player to use all her Story Cards and play her Ending Card. The object of the game, though, isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just to win, but to have fun telling a story together. Once Upon a Time was named to GAMES Magazine_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Best Family Card Game section in 1997. </notes>

    <notes>Atlas Games (ATG1030)
Tell your own fantastic tales of brave heroes and daring adventure! Once Upon a Time is the award-winning storytelling card game that encourages creativity and collaborative play. One player is the Storyteller, and begins telling a story using the fairytale elements on her Story cards, guiding the plot toward her Ending Card. The other players use their own cards to interrupt her and become the new Storyteller. The winner is the first player to use all her Story Cards and play her Ending Card. The object of the game, though, isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just to win, but to have fun telling a story together. </notes>

Tell your own fantastic tales of brave heroes and daring adventure! Once Upon a Time is the award-winning storytelling card game that encourages creativity and collaborative play. One player is the Storyteller, and begins telling a story using the fairytale elements on her Story cards, guiding the plot toward her Ending Card. The other players use their own cards to interrupt her and become the new Storyteller. The winner is the first player to use all her Story Cards and play her Ending Card. The object of the game, though, isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just to win, but to have fun telling a story together.</notes>

    <notes>The game is like new, only opened! Cards still in shrink wrap.
I will ship from Germany and I am willing to ship anywhere.
Please ask me, for the shipping costs for your land.
I will charge shipping at cost. Everything will be well packed.
You can pay me through Paypal or bank transfer to my German bank account but any fees charged must be covered by you.
If you buy more games, then I make all in one package!
We have a large private collection of games. Due to space and time constraints we must rid ourselves of some of the games. Therefore, these are private sales.</notes>
