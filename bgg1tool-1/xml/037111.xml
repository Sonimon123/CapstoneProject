   <description>Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Official Site, Rules _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; FAQ: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;a target='_blank' href=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rel=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nofollow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm..._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;/a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;;esem=4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;a target='_blank' href=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; rel=_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;nofollow_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;/a_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Punched and bagged, but never actually played.  (Snif)  The cards have been placed in BGG tuckboxes and everything in the box is like new.  The corners of the box top have been worn so that they are white, but otherwise everything looks great.

Will ship anywhere, but international bidders beware that shipping with tracking is at least $40 and probably more. Buyer pays full shipping cost. All of my _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;for trade_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; games are for sale as well, so if some of those interest you, let me know and we will negotiate a price.</notes>

    <notes>Opened and punched but never played.  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $7.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll try to consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.</notes>

    <notes>This is a Marketplace item for a commissioned paintjob for the whole miniatures of the Battlestar Galactica Boardgame, along with its 2 expansions (Pegasus and Exodus).
This is not for anyone to buy : this item has specifically been created to keep track of the transaction between Nosnhoj Kräm (Eeville), the buyer, and myself, the painter.
All details have been discussed between us and this marketplace listing is for commodity.

    <notes>Both the base game and Pegasus expansion!

The Pegasus expansion is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; because the external shrink has been removed, but all the components are still new in their individual shrink wraps.

Game is immaculate as can be expected. There is a slight tear on the bottom edge of the box, about 5 cm along the edge not overly noticeable. Tear caused by shipping the game to me. Bank transfer preferred or Cash on pick up/deliver. Game located in northern suburbs of Melbourne.</notes>

    <notes>This may be for you if you just want a player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s copy, want extra pieces, or need to replace cards.
The components are in like-new condition.  The cards look like they have not been used or used very lightly.  There are no dog-ears, bends or creases in the cards.
It is missing three components.  None of these three is critical for game play.
1) It comes without a box.  (I bought this as part of a combined set.)
2) It is missing one of the nuke markers.  A handmade hand-drawn replacement is included.
3) It is missing the jump/countdown marker.  There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s nothing special about this marker, anything can be used.
I went through and hand-counted everything to make sure I knew what I was selling.  Everything else other than what I mentioned is there, and is in great shape.  It even has one extra viper (9 total).
Will ship worldwide.  This is going to weigh about 2.5 lbs. when packaged.  It will be less for regional shipping, but shipping to the east coast will be $11.30.</notes>

*PLEASE READ*
I am sending a Marketplace order for each item. If you have won multiple games, you will get multiple orders. You can purchase each one individually or wait to purchase them all at once. This will not change shipping cost. All combined shipping orders will be exact cost. If you won only one item you will pay the listed shipping cost as described in that item.

    <notes>Well played BSG and all 3 expansions.  All in the Daybreak Expansion box (with some outside too). All cards sleeved. Main board is very worn but still playable. Held together with a bit of tape, but the dials work great.  Well-organized parts with all 4 rule books in very good condition. A quick inventory found that the New Caprica board from the Pegasus Expansion is missing -- cannot guarantee 100% of pieces in the box, I did not do a card count but I believe everything else is there, so sold as is.  Comes from non-smoking home, with silica packets in box.

I never played this game but I unboxed it. It is just not my game and I lack the players and time to play it more often. I want to remove it from my collection and find a new home for the game. The box is in a good state however the cards have bent a little bit.

    <notes>This is a lot that includes the base game along with two expansion: Daybreak and Pegasus. The two expansions have been neatly sorted into separate bags and are stored within the box for the base game. The game has hardly been touched; some of the expansion materials such as decks of cards are still in shrinkwrap.
A buyer just backed out at the last minute, so the entire thing is already boxed for immediate shipment via USPS Priority (large flat rate box).  Shipping to U.S. only.  Local pickup possible in the vicinity of New Paltz, NY.</notes>

    <notes>I have one copy of the Battlestar Galactica board game to sell. It’s only been played twice and is in excellent condition. All the pieces are intact with no damage or wear. There’s a very minor amount of wear on the corners of the box.
This is a fun, cooperative game that can take most of an afternoon to play. I used to play it often with a group of friends that I gamed with regularly, so I bought my own copy. But, of course, most of my gaming group has now moved to other areas of the country, so it’s been sitting unused in my games cabinet for a year or two now. I’d love to get it in the hands of someone that would like to play it. (I highly recommend picking up the Pegasus expansion — which is still in print — too.)</notes>

Includes all 3 expansions (Pegasus, Daybreak, and Exodus) and wooden organizer (not sure of brand).  All components are in excellent condition.  The is a bit of very minor shelf wear on the box.  I no longer have the boxes for the expansion pacs, but everything fits well in the main game box using the insert with just a slight rise with the rulebooks.   This is really the full package - easy to setup and play and all ready to go.  $18 Flat rate shipping to the lower 48 states - but will refund back if actual shipping is less (unlikely due to the weight).</notes>

_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.
After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival…but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?
Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;

    <notes>Battlestar Galactica the Board Game with all expansions. Includes base game, daybreak expansion, pegasus expansion and exodus expansion. I keep everything all in one box to save shelf space. I have since thrown the other empty boxes away. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m using the daybreak expansion lid and the base game bottom portion of the box to contain all materials.  Base game has been played once, I purchased one of the expansions new and the other 2 were purchased 2nd hand un-punched.  Cards for one of the expansions still in shrink, cardboard parts are stored in Plano type container.  See pictures in my profile gallery to see components and storage container.  Minimal shelf wear.  PM me with any questions.</notes>
