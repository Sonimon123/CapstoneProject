   <description>The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Resistance: Avalon is a standalone game, and while The Resistance is not required to play, the games are compatible and can be combined._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost. The Resistance: Avalon is a standalone game, and while The Resistance is not required to play, the games are compatible and can be combined. </notes>

The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost. The Resistance: Avalon is a standalone game, and while The Resistance is not required to play, the games are compatible and can be combined. </notes>

The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost. The Resistance: Avalon is a standalone game, and while The Resistance is not required to play, the games are compatible and can be combined.</notes>

Warning: There_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s no English on the cards and tokens. Everything is in Chinese. But I guess you can still play it by reading the icons or using paste-ups. Well, considering its low price, you can use it as a second copy for travel purpose too.</notes>

    <notes>Opened, but un-played. Kickstarter Version with extras. Autographed on inside box lid. Item is in very good condition. I treat my games very well. If there are components inside the game they are most likely bagged in 4mm, thick bags. I will work with you to ship the most cost efficient way or however you prefer. When I ship things I take extra measurers to mitigate any potential shipping damage. If the item is a small card game the shipping will be USPS First Class and will be around $5 total with shipping materials.</notes>

Reserved for dtwiley for pickup at Gen Con
Please submit payment via PayPal, Google Wallet or Venmo to gramaw@gmail.com.  Alternatively, you may pay, via one of these methods or COD, directly at the convention.  
Since I am selling so many games I plan to meet as many buyers as possible on Saturday morning at 9AM outside of hall A on level 1 of the convention center, near room 128 (this was the former location of multiple Gen Con Math trade meetups, in case you are familiar.)  You can find a link to a map of the denoted area here:    https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4236187/gramaw
If at all possible please meet me at this time and location.  If this will not be possible, please Geekmail me so we can make an alternative arrangement.  Lastly, my phone number is 847.454.6369 if you need to reach me at the convention.</notes>
