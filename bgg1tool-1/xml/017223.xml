    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games - World of Warcraft: The Boardgame
Language: English
Players: 2 to 6
Age: 13+
Duration: 2 to 4 hour
Weight: 4.100 kg
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Theme: Take on the role of a chivalrous paladin or a wise shaman, a holy priest or a vile warlock, a mighty mage or a crafty rogue. Play as a savage orc, a mighty tauren, a tribal troll, or one of the Forsaken undead; become an ingenious gnome, a doughty dwarf, a mysterious Night Elf, or a noble human. Based on the popular World of Warcraft Massively Multiplayer Online Game from Blizzard Entertainment, World of Warcraft: the Board Game invites the players to choose from 16 characters, drawn from the eight races and nine character classes of the Warcraft universe, and take up arms for the glory of the Horde ... or the Alliance. Travel across Lordaeron, vanquish monsters, gain experience and power, and earn honor for your faction. World of Warcraft: the Board Game is a team-based fantasy adventure. The Horde and the Alliance factions must compete to be the first to defeat the invincible Overlord – be it the lich-king Kel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Thuzad, the dragon Nefarian, or the demon Kazzak – or, failing that, to be the last faction standing when it comes to all-out war!

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this game as it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t it our table too often. The condition is acceptable, some damage on the box and 4 markers out of 300+ are missing, without any influence on the playability of the game. I will send to Germany or Europe. 
Just have a look at me ebay-account to see my good reputation (alexmelzer). 
Auf Deutsch:
Ich verkaufe das Brettspiel da es bei uns kaum noch gespielt wird (zu viele gute Alternativen). Das Spiel ist in akzeptablem Zustand, die Seite der Schachtel ist etwas beschädigt (wurde aber geklebt) und es fehlen 4 von mehr als 300 Spielmarkern, das hat aber keinen Einfluss auf die Spielbarkeit des Spiels. Versendet wird nach Deutschland oder Europa ab 5 Euro.
Da ich hier noch keine positiven Bewertungen habe: ihr könnte auch gerne auf ebay schauen, selber Benutzername mit genug positiven Bewertungen.
Viele Grüße,

There are two broken pieces in this game, the sword of a monster and the back of a relatively unimportant card.
The components are in good condition and complete despite several plays.  The box shows much wear and one corner is ripped.
The box is really full and heavy, shipping will be high. </notes>

    <notes>Item Name: World of Warcraft: The Board Game
Description: Mint, sealed big box FFG WoW: The Board Game.
Shipping Weight: 10 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For one game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

The box is damaged. I bought it from a gentleman who did not properly box it for shipment. I subsequently found a box the exact size of the coffin to house the original box inside.

    <notes>World of Warcraft Boardgame with the Shadows of War and Burning Crusades expansions 
It is not a perfect copy. The following things are missing:
Base game:
Rules (can be downloaded)
One of 2 monster reference sheets (the other can be copied or the sheets from Burning Crusades can be used)
One of 3 Blue Ghouls (since it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the only one of the minis missing any mini from anything else can be substituted)
Box insert (I might find that before I leave)
Burning Crusades:
Rules (can be downloaded)
Shadows of War:
Box insert (I might find that)
The box of the base game shows some wear but still looks good. The expansion boxes are in excellent shape.
All of the cards and tokens of all the games are there. 
The game is plenty playable and in pretty good shape overall.</notes>

    <notes>This game is complete and comes with all pieces. The reason I am listing as acceptable is the box has a split corner shows a lot of signs of wear. The game pieces are in great shape and have only been played 2-3 times. It belonged to a friend of mine who kept it at the bottom of his game collection. This does come with the Shadow of War expansion which is complete in a great condition box. All pieces are accounted for and are seperated and individually bagged and labeled. Paypal only. I would be willing to do a local pick up on the west side of Indianapolis

    <notes>This game would have rated like new except for 1 small dent in one box corner. I counted all figures, cards and counters and this game is 100% complete. No wear on any game component. The game board is like new. The box is also mint, except for the one dent. As this game was pre-ordered, it also comes with a bronze, limited edition world of warcraft hero figure (Thundershot).

    <notes>This is a copy of the hard to find World of Warcraft the board game.  I paid 100 bucks for this to find out I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like it at all.  I have checked the contents of the box, which are not complete, but only 3 very minor items are missing, so please this would like to find a good home.
These are the issues with this game.   
The box is damaged, on 1 end, still closes and it is not very noticeable.
The following items are missing/damaged:
     1 paladin token is missing
     1 health token is missing
     the female elf cleric_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s weapon has broken off.
This is still a fine boardgame.
This is from a smoke free home.
Shipping will be actual cost to get it to your house. If you decided to purchase I will just need your address, I will get shipping, you send me the money via paypal and then I send the item to you. Easy peezy.</notes>

    <notes>The only component that is in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition is the box lid. I bought this as a ding and dent copy because one corner of the box lid was damaged. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s noticeable, but the damage is superficial and caused no damage to the inside or the components. All of the other components: cards, figures, etc are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; condition.</notes>

    <notes>Included is my copy of World of Warcraft: The Board Game plus the Shadow of War expansion that adds more cards for each class (must have exp if you ask me).
The game has roughly 1000 pieces, which I dedicated the time to sort/store in 4 plano containers and a lot of baggies.  That is all included, but it does mean the original insert is gone and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve integrated all cards from the expansion into the base box. Check out the pictures for more information or feel free to shoot me a geekmail.
Condition-wise the game components are in good condition.  A few issues beyond normal wear and tear that made me lower the condition:
1. A few of the large infernals had a small piece break.  I have reglued them myself, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m including this to be thorough.  The rest of the minis are in very good condition.
2. The box was beat up a bit by the original owner.  It has been taped on the sides that needed it. Check out the pictures for more details.
Buyer pays $25 shipping.  If it turns out to be less, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll happily refund the difference.  Costs are estimated based on USPS standard mail from 53719.  If you have another carrier you prefer or want to pick it up instead, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m happy to try and be flexible.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the base game plus the (personally essential) expansion Shadow of War, that adds way more options for character builds.  The components are all in excellent shape, bagged and organized per monster category and per character class.  The box of Shadows of War is in pristine condition, but the box for the base game is worn, with a little tape on a couple corners.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a big, heavy box, and shipping will be $25 maximum, and I will refund you the difference if any cheaper.

    <notes>This includes the base game and the two expansions, Burning Crusade and Shadows of War.  All components are included in the Base Game coffin size box and the Burning Crusade expansion box (no SoW box included).  Box inserts are removed.  Game components are complete, in unplayed, like new condition.  The base game rule book is in a used condition with the edging somewhat ripped or bent a bit.  But, the overall rulebook is clean.  This is from a smoke free home.  Buyer to pay shipping and pay pal fee.   I anticipate the shipping will be expensive given the coffin size box plus the expansion box.  So, best rate will likely be by FedEx Ground.  Shipping from NJ 07436.</notes>

Game was opened and I punched the boards and put everything in zip lock bags. However, it was never played. I have carefully counted and inventoried every fig and bit in the box. All game components 100% complete and like new. Minor shelf wear on outer box corner (see pics). Interior cardboard separator/organizer insert has torn side (see pics).
Box is big and pretty heavy.</notes>

    <notes>I did a complete inventory of this game.  It is missing one of the gold tokens, it has 137 of the 138 tokens, and the insert has been tossed.  There is a 1/2 piece of blue plastic.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t know if it came off one of the pieces or was just a loose piece of flashing.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve included it in a ziplock.  Other than that it has been inventoried and verified complete.  This includes the expansion Shadows of War.  The expansion is contained in the base game and does not include the box.  
The game components are in very good condition with no noticeable wear.  The rulebook is nice and flat. There is minor whiting of the box corners.  Because it is a heavy game, the box top has some splitting in the corners, but the box bottom is in great condition with no splits.  There is no dishing or creasing of the box top.
This is one of the classic FFG coffin boxes.  It is large and heavy box, so it will not fit in a flat rate box.</notes>

I will happily combine shipping with multiple purchases. I only charge actual shipping via USPS, and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m glad to arrange for local pick up if it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s feasible.

    <notes>To say the box is in horrible shape would be dishonest, it is much worse.
The game board is slightly warped.  I think leaving it under a mattress for a few days would maybe straighten it out.
Missing one red, standard, eight-sided die.
All other components are present and in excellent condition.  All of the tokens are unpunched except for the 12 Action Tokens.  The unpunched sheets of tokens do have a few areas that are starting to tear.  Care will be needed when punching the pieces.</notes>

Everything fits in base box, If you want the Burning crusades box shipping would be higher.
Missing one coin token
Missing one event card from base game.
Neither of these will have any impact on game play.

    <notes>This is a bundle which includes The Burning Crusade expansion. 
PLEASE READ:
Game condition is great except for: one missing character mini from the BC expansion and a beat up base game rulebook. The rulebook is missing pages which have been replaced with color copies. Also, the box has quite a bit of packing tape on it. It is structurally sound. 
Shipping: $25 as this is a HUGE box.</notes>

    <notes>Base game AND shadow-war expansion. 
Important notes: 
-Please look at images.
-This game has significant damage to the box (looks like someone dragged it on concrete or something) and the rule book for the base game (torn pages). 
-The box for the expansion is not included.
-As this was obtain in a trade, I have carefully counted every miniature/card/chit. It took me several hours to go through everything but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s all there (including an extra green murloc miniature for some reason). Additionally, the actual game-components are in much better shape then I expected (the cards show little-wear, despite having black borders). 
-This game will need to be ship in a large box (26x15x7) and likely weigh 11-12lbs total. Shipping is paid by the buyer. Game is shipped from 23113 (Midlothian, Virginia).</notes>

Buyer to pay actual shipping, I’ll cover anything over $45. I will ship this via USPS, UPS or FedEx based on lowest cost option or buyer preference. Due to size and weight, I cannot ship this outside the US so please don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ask.
