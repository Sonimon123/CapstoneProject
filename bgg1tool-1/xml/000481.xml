   <description>This game uses a collection of smallish hexagon clusters arranged in a circle.  Mercenaries, in the form of small wooden blocks, are placed onto the land pieces.  Players can then use these blocks to attempt to gain control of the corresponding mercenary type, or place the same small blocks onto the board which can help the player who controls that color._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Once a player has majority of control markers on a piece of land, he can build a tower there.  The tower serves as a semi-permanent control marker, as well as a way to win.  If two land pieces are controlled by the same player, the land pieces are combined into one, which makes the position harder to take by the other players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The first player to place a set number of towers wins the game, but the game can also end when the land masses are reduced to three or fewer, in which case the player with the most towers placed wins._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO 162)
Type: Area control 
Number of players: 2 - 4
Age of players: 12+
Length: 30 - 45 minutes
Game Description: 
The players are Charlemagne_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s heirs and in constant conflict with each other. He has asked them to build castles in his favorite territories. To do this they must seek and maintain the support of the five powerful clans of paladins. The paladins are the o nes who administer the Emperorrquote s lands. During the game, the players have many resources and options. In each round they decide the order in which they will take their turns and how far they will be allowed to move the Emperor, which is cruc ial, since castles can only be built in his presence. When castles are built in neighboring territories, these territories are joined, so that, as the game progresses, great domains are formed, defended by four, five and more castles. In the end, to win t he game and gain the Emperor_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s favor - and perhaps even the right of succession - a player must have built 10 castles.
