   <description>217,453,883 years, seven months and 26 days before our time, the first dinosaurs left their home in the sea and climbed onto the land. The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;dominant species_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;. At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you've evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of  prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; but don't spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth. When the meteor strikes (determined partly by dice), the game ends!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Hello, these are the game(s) you won in my recent auction.  Please respond with the mailing address you want this shipped to (or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be picking it up from me) so I know how much to charge you for shipping.
If you have a strong shipping preference please let me know else I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just go with whatever is cheapest.
If you plan on picking them up from me in Dallas or San Antonio please let me know, if you haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t already.
Thanks for your bids and hope this finds you well.
Allen

    <notes>Game only - this game does not have a box. I was in a car accident and I was holding the box on my lap when it happened. When the air bag went off, the box exploded from the impact.
The game is playable. It is missing one brown cylinder marker. Other than that, all pieces are accounted for and in great condition. This is a great way to play the game for a fraction of the cost or if you need replacement pieces for your set. 
Shipping will be FedEx from Florida.  </notes>

    <notes>This is the English language edition.  It comes with bonus dinosaur and meteor miniatures.  For some reason I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t get the site to include my image with the item listing, so a (blurry) picture of the miniatures is in my gallery, here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/image/828932/lindsey?size=original
The box top has an outward bow.  Box bottom shows light dirt on its corners. The plastic insert is gone (to fit the miniatures). The rulebook is in good condition -- It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s clean, but has a bend near the bottom of the booklet. The cards and tiles are in good condition, with light dirt and wear. The player boards are in good condition, with light dirt. The bag, weather board, bidding board, and map are all in very good condition. The game comes with five sets of ten properly sized plastic painted dinosaurs. (You_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll get the original wooden dinosaur markers, too.) Similarly, the game comes with a fancy translucent painted meteor (really a D_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;D miniatures figure called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Living Flaming Sphere_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) as well as the original black meteor cylinder.
Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

Game in excellent condition. Box has slight paper warp on bottom.  It was received that way.  I will only charge the actual USPS shipping price (lowest possible) with delivery confirmation for the game.
Feel free to browse through my other games for sale in the marketplace. I will provide free shipping in the continental US for orders of over $150. I will also offer $10 off on shipping to anywhere else in the world for orders over $150.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASM EVO02)
217,453,883 years, seven months and 26 days before our time, the first dinosaurs left their home in the sea and climbed onto the land. The ever-changing climate was their first adversary, forcing them to remain constantly on the move. But weather was not their only problem. In order to survive and flourish, they had to evolve, and to do it quickly!
In Evo, you control the survival and evolution of a species of dinosaurs called Dinos. You guide their migrations to temperate climates, you acquire the perfect genes to develop your Dinos and mutate them, and you push out other creatures that have yet to learn the meaning of the term _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;dominant species_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;. At the end of the game, you and your Dinos will not be the winners unless you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve evolved more quickly and successfully than everyone else.
Each turn is divided into six phases, in which Dinos move, fight, reproduce and evolve to ensure that their species has the characteristics to survive the various perils of prehistoric life. Players earn and spend mutation points to adapt their species for survival – but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t spend all of them as the remainder are counted to determine the winner.
With every round of play a meteor moves one step closer to earth. When the meteor strikes (determined partly by dice), the game ends!

    <notes>THIS IS NOT FOR THE GAME EVO
This is for a set of 48 Plastic Dino figures (8ea of 6 species) to replace those lame wooden mini Brontosaurs that are included with the game. This is actually one more species of Dinosaurs than you need for the game, but...having choices is a good thing!!

    <notes>Unpunched and in great shape EXCEPT that it is missing one of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;horn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; gene tiles.  This will affect game play-- either you will need to make a replacement that feels the same as the other gene tiles when being pulled from the bag, or you will need to play with a different mix/amount of gene tiles than was intended.   Or I suppose you could make a cruder replacement and then use a different method to select gene tiles rather than drawing them out of the bag.
Other than the missing tile, all other game components are unpunched and in great shape, and the box is also in great condition with no split corners.</notes>
