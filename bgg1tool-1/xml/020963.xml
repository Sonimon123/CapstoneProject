Hello, these are the game(s) you won in my recent auction.  Please respond with the mailing address you want this shipped to (or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be picking it up from me) so I know how much to charge you for shipping.
If you have a strong shipping preference please let me know else I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll just go with whatever is cheapest.
If you plan on picking them up from me in Dallas or San Antonio please let me know, if you haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t already.
Thanks for your bids and hope this finds you well.
Allen

    <notes>Played three times.  Components have been played gently and are in really good shape.  Rulebook has the most wear from players referencing the rules during game play (you can tell it has been read and handed back and forth among the players), but no torn pages or anything like that.  Box is in great condition and solid, though box cover has some bowing on two sides.</notes>

5lbs. shipping from 15229. Will fit into a Medium Flat Rate, but prefer my own packaging for proper game protection. $15 max for shipping.
Acceptable methods of payment are PayPal, Money Order or Personal Check. If paying via PayPal, will ship only to a confirmed address. If paying by personal check or e-checks (via PayPal), check must clear before shipping. Once the order is confirmed, please email/gmail me and let me know how payment will be made.
I ship either FedEx Ground or USPS Priority with delivery confirmation (whichever is less expensive). I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t use flat-rate boxes unless the game can be properly protected. If a shipping price is quoted, it is for the continental U.S. only. If outside of the U.S., please ask for a quote before clicking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.

    <notes>New in Shrink. Fantasy Flight 2009 printing with the silver logo (English). The shrink-wrap has worn down on a few corners and has shows a bit of whitened corners. Also, it feels like there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a light crease in the box top. See pictures below and captions for any additional info.
For payment, I vastly prefer to avoid PayPal. My first choice is payment by Amazon gift card, but other options may be considered... just ask.

    <notes>The game is complete and in decent condition however there are some issues. The box has some shelfwear to the edges and corners. The event and weapon cards were not sleeved by the previous owner and have nicks along most of the edges. 
However, the Dracula locations cards (who_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s identity must be kept secret) are in good to very good condition and do not have the same wear as the other cards.

    <notes>This is the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Silver Logo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; edition of Fury of Dracula found here: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameversion/202726/fantasy-flight-silver-logo-edition 2009
The insert has been removed.  The cards are all sleeved and in plastic storage boxes.  The dice have been upgraded.  A homemade foam board screen for Dracula is also included as well as glass beads to mark Dracula_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s personal map.  The figures have been primed gray for painting but can also be played with in this condition.
The game was never played and all of the components are in excellent shape. The box itself has some minor shelf wear on the edges and corners but is in great shape otherwise. Pictures will be provided if requested.
Buyer pays EXACTLY what the post office charges me to ship - send me a geekmail for a quote. I accept only PayPal.</notes>

(I made bad experiences before with Paypal, so this is not an option for me. If you are not sure about paying in advance, I can provide a flawless ebay account as well).
International buyers: Please ask for shipping costs before buying. Please remember that maybe you will have to pay some taxes and import fees as well.
Edit: There is a small cut on one edge, as you can see on the picture.</notes>

    <notes>I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been a BGG member since 2004 - now it seems I have to make space in my shelves so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to let go some of the games I bought with the intention of eventually playing but never did. I really hope they go to a house that can cherish them as I do.
Dracula is the Red Logo English version. I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t remember when I bought it but I know I wanted it badly. Somehow it never took off with my playgroup so it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perhaps time to let it go. I played it at most 3 times. Everything is in mint condition and the cards are sleeved with standard sized sleeves. 
I can provide pictures of every facet of the game if you want to. 
I can accept Paypal but within Europe I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d prefer a bank transfer to avoid Paypal_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s fees.
I suppose shipping would be in the region of the 15€ but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have to check to be sure.</notes>

I am the 2nd owner.  Components and box are in excellent condition with some slight shelf wear.  Original owner created tuck boxes for all cards which are included.  This is an excellent copy of this highly sought after game!

    <notes>Selling my copy, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s gotten a ton (ton ton ton) of plays over the years, and time to find it a new home.
Missing component: 1 of Dracula_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s blood tokens. Never was an issue for us cause we only ever used one of the 15 blood tokens anyways (like how the hunters track their health). The first time dracula goes to sea that blood token missing will be a non-issue anyways. =]
Other than the missing blood token everything is there. Box has shelf-wear on the edges. Cards are fine but are starting to look a bit worn around the corners. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d probably recommend sleeving the cards. Mini_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s are great, map is great.</notes>

    <notes>Got the newest edition for Christmas and, while there are some things I like better about 2nd edition, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have a much harder time parting with a gift. So this one goes to the trade/sale pile.
Box corners show some wear. Components are complete and in excellent shape. Includes some rule summary printouts (one improvement in the newer edition is the rulebook, it actually has an index!).
Mailing from 04011, I prefer using USPS priority, but will use other methods if you prefer.</notes>

    <notes>This copy of Fury of Dracula, Second Edition has been played a few times, and while the box shows minor signs of shelf wear (no split corners), has all the components (cards, board, etc) in excellent condition.  Please see photos.  The rule book shows some signs of creasing on the spine, but is certainly in good shape and in no danger of splits or tears. The photographs are part of the description.  Please review photographs before buying.  This is a fantastic game at a great price, and can be yours just in time for a Halloween game night  (mwah, hah, hah...).  Please, serious buyers only and check out my other items in the GeekMarket.  If you buy two or more games from me, I will deduct $5 off of your total shipping cost.  Thank you for shopping!</notes>

Check my other listings and my ratings! 
I only accept PayPal (and only goods and services payments).  
Yes, I will do local pickup.  
Otherwise, shipping is via USPS Priority Mail usually within 2 business days of you paying for your order. Shipping is calculated by actual weight from zip code 19438.  I will carefully pack your game with packing peanuts and charge actual shipping costs.  Because USPS makes it easy for me, I will not use other shipping methods.  If you buy more than $100 worth of games, I will cover 25% of the shipping costs (in US only).  If you buy more than $200 worth of games I will cover 50% of the shipping costs (in US only).  
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future. Please check my other listings! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  
Happy shopping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Happy Gaming!</notes>

    <notes>My copy of The Fury of Dracula has never been played.    All the cards are still in shrink wrap, and the sheet of game pieces is unpunched.  Board and components are all in as-new condition.   A very nice-looking copy.   Note:  I have included the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Improved Dracula Reference Map_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; which I downloaded from the file section  of BGG and laminated.  
Last chance at this price.  
Buyer pays shipping from 56362.  Will ship to lower 48 States only.</notes>
