   <description>In 982, a Viking jarl called Erik the Red sailed from the western coast of Iceland and discovered a new land. He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game mechanics _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead. As the others take it in to account when searching for partners for their deals._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the English/German version from Altar Games. 
Still in shrink BUT....
... due to the attentions of the post office, the lid and box have a torn corner seam (top right hand) - might be able to glue back but can certainly be repaied by clear tape.</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m an avid game collector in a smoke-free home and take good care of my games. Unless otherwise noted above, game is complete with little or no shelf wear or damaged components. High-resolution picture available upon request. 
Domestic US shipping is $12.35 for USPS with tracking (insurance is optional if you want to pay for it). Be sure to check my other listings, I usually have multiple games up for sale at any time, and you pay actual shipping cost if you buy multiple games which will usually save you money. I pack my games carefully and have had no complaints or issues. I usually ship the next business day after receipt of payment. Must pay me via PayPal (I will cover the fees).
International shipping will be ACTUAL SHIPPING COST. For promo cards this is usually $3-$5. For card games and other small items that can fit into a DVD mailer, this is usually $10-$20. For larger items up to 64oz this is usually $35-$45. For items over 64oz that will fit into a medium flat-rate box (e.g. Agricola or Netrunner sized boxes) the cost is usually $60. Big and heavy items will likely cost $70 or more. Contact me BEFORE ORDERING if you have any questions about shipping. </notes>

    <notes>Buyer pays actual shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx. Shipping from Chicago, IL, USA. Local pickup is available.
Shipping to other countries is expensive. It could be as much as $30-$60+ depending on where it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s going and the weight of package. Please feel free to message me about the shipping cost before buying. 
PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, or message me if you prefer another online method and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll look into it.</notes>

    <notes>NOTE: this game is wildly under-priced. Highly unlikely it will ever be re-issued.
Very slight shelf wear on the box base edges and corners, due to very thin surface paper.
Bought new, played once, put away. In excellent condition, only listed as VG as it has been played. With English rules.
UK BUYERS - Very cost effective to get two or three games.  MyHermes, 0-1kg starts at £2.79, but up to 10kg is from just £6.49. Adding one or two more games is very good value for you. 10kg gets you a lot of games. See their current prices here (scroll down after clicking): https://www.myhermes.co.uk/our-services/our-prices.html
Happy to receive Paypal in GBP, USD, JPY, EUR.
Open to receive Bank Transfers. Looking at TransferWise too.
I can provide photos of my copy on request (message me your email).
UK - Can ship quickly cheaply by courier. REST OF EUROPE - Can ship quickish by Royal Mail
JAPAN / USA / CAN - Card games and small games to Japan are very easy. Small parcels can easily go by Royal Mail, but larger items are tricky especially with all sides totalling up over 90cm. International couriers are expensive out of the UK.
UK BUYERS - Paypal charges me a fee if you make a commercial transaction (around 4%), but not on a gift.
OUTSIDE UK BUYERS - Paypal charges an extra cross-border fee on top of the commercial transaction fee (up to 7%), and on a gift.</notes>
