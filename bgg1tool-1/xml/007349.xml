    <notes>CONDITION: Excellent condition overall, the contents are used and complete, with unpunched counters.  There is a 3/4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tear to one edge of one of the maps - I tore it while inspecting the game!  The box has light shelfwear and creasing and a price tag on the cover, but is sound with no split corners (see photo).
POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50
European Postage: £8.00
Rest of World Postage: £15.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000. I am a verified PAYPAL Premier account holder (since 2004), with over 650 PayPal Verified Buyers.
SELLERS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
PAYMENT TERMS: 
Please wait until you receive my invoice before sending payment. 
Payment is due within 5 days of the date you receive my invoice. 
Please do not purchase if you do not intend to pay, or cannot pay within this time frame.
PAYMENT METHODS: 
UK buyers may use PayPal, cheque or cash-on-collection.
Overseas buyers MUST USE PAYPAL only.
SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail. Surface Mail rate to Rest of World is available if you wish (same as Europe Air rate), but Surface Mail to Rest of World can take up to 2 months!  There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.
INSURANCE:
Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £39 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).
CUSTOMS:
Buyers outside the EU are responsible for all Customs charges applicable to their country.
RETURNS:
New Unopened items may be returned for a refund of the purchase price of the item, excluding shipping charges, within 7 days of the delivery date. All returned items must be in the original packaging and in the condition that they were shipped to you.

    <notes>The game looks to be in excellent condition. About 10% of the counters have been punched and are in trays, the rest have been undisturbed. I would guess it was never played (I am not the original owner). The only damage is slight shelf wearing and age, as well as someone taped the box shut at some point, I did not take the tape off as I was worried it would damage the box.
I will ship worldwide at buyers expense or can do face to face in Toronto/GTA.</notes>

    <notes>For user: HuginnGreiling
Game is in very good condition and has been verified as complete. It appears the NK _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; UN player charts/tables and the game turn record have been carefully removed from the instruction booklet but are in great condition with no rips or writing on them. All 520 counters are present and have been punched and stored in a counter tray. Also comes with 2 22_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x32_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; mapsheets, 8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;x11_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; player aid card, 10 sided die, and rulebooklet (clean - no rips, writing or other markings. Box shows a little wear (dishing to the box top, shelf wear) but overall good shape with no split corners.

Please contact me for shipping costs if you live outside the UK.
Shipping in the UK is GBP 11.22, recorded delivery and fully tracked. This isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t the absolute cheapest option, I know, but is necessary to remain within PayPal Seller Protection guidelines.
The cheaper options (non-tracked) leave me open to being scammed, and I sadly speak from experience in this respect.
The game will be safely and securely packed.

    <notes>93 counters punched and clipped, 93 counters verified in the tray.  Contents verified complete and in excellent condition.  The only issue I found was some slight yellow highlighter marks on the front cover of the rule book.  I have no idea why as there is no highlighter on the inside of the rule book.  Someone was doodling.  Box is square and straight.  Goodly amount of edge and shelf wear.  Couple of corners rubbed hard but intact and square.  Its not a beauty but a really nice players copy.

    <notes>So Compass is reprinting this, and I want the old version off my shelves. The box is sound, but a mess. The components are in excellent condition, however. The counters are partially punched. I counted three short of the total. Are they blanks that are missing? Probably, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not going to do the work to find out. Priced accordingly.
$9 shipping East of the Mississippi except for Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota; $14 West of the Mississippi and to Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.</notes>
