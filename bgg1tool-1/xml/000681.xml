   <description>Quarto! has a 4_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;times;4 board and 16 pieces. Each piece has four dichotomous attributes _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; color, height, shape, and consistency _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; so each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid. The object is to place the fourth piece in a row in which all four pieces have at least one attribute in common. The twist is that your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board each turn._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Gigamic - Quarto! - COMPLETE. Outer box is in good condition with the usual shelfwear (particularly along the edges) with a couple of small tears from scotch tape removal on several of the sides (See upclose photos for more detail). Interior contents are in very solid condition. The game appears to have been played only a handful of times. See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 4.5 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by gigamic, 1991 - Quarto! - COMPLETE. Outer Box is in very good condition with minimal shelfwear and a few light scratches on the back (not bad but needs mentioned).  There is a small tear on one side from tape removal (about 0.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 0.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, opening side) and (2) pieces of clear tape still present (manufacturer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s clear 0.25_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; tape).  Note: there is some price tag residue about (1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;) also found on the opening edge.  Interior contents are in excellent condition, pieces and board are wooden with no noticable flaws.  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 3 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above.

    <notes>Fundex (FDX 5201)
Quarto! has a 4x4 board and 16 pieces. Each piece has four dichotomous attributes: color, height, shape and consistency. So each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid. The object is to place the fourth piece in a row where all four pieces have at least one attribute in common. The twist is your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board every turn.</notes>

    <notes>Wooden board and pieces are still beautiful and look NEW.
1991 edition. Box is still sturdy but shows a lot of edge/corner wear. Rules are a bit crumpled.
