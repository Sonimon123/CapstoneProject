Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs best will win. There are four rounds to a game: Each round has a building phase, an auction phase, a scoring phase and a card drawing phase. In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself. A building is finished when it has a roof; the first roof in a prefecture determines the shape of all other roofs. In the auction phase players can auction for temples, wells and amphitheaters, earning extra points. This is a beautiful production._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This game by Alan R. Moon and Aaron Weissblum is a mix of territory acquisition, resource management and even a little auctioning thrown in for good measure. So-called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Architects of the Eternal City_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;, compete in old Rome for the most spectacular buildings and dominance in the Roman prefectures. Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs most effectively to secure points will win._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>The box is in good condition. (Two corners are slightly damaged.) All components are in excellent condition, except for the cardboard box insert which is torn (although still functional -- and it has nothing to do with gameplay).
Payment: With payment via PayPal or money order, I will ship upon receipt of payment. With personal check, I will wait one week after the check arrives to ship the game.
Shipping Costs: I prefer to ship via the postal service, but I can also ship via UPS or FedEx upon request. I will only charge actual costs for shipping.</notes>

So-called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Architects of the Eternal City_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;, compete in old Rome for the most spectacular buildings and dominance in the Roman prefectures. Whoever uses the 90 blocks and 40 roofs most effectively to secure points will win.</notes>
