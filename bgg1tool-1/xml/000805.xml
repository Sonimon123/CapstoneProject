    <notes>What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bad: The box. It has lid crushing, tape, cup rings, etc. The cards show some wear and tear, but are not seriously bent or marked. 
What_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing: The _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;phase of the moon_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; cardboard standup. What will be included is a printout of said standup, and I can even forward you a jpeg of it so you can make an even better one if you want. Also, one of the plastic stands that hold this cutout is missing, though there are still three.
All of the vamps are there, all of the cards, the Buffy pewter marker, the Evil card holder, all of the dice, all of the player mats, etc. So the game is playable, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just not in terrific shape, hence the low low price!
Pictures available upon request. </notes>

    <notes>Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Hasbro/Milton Bradley) This game has only been played a few times. Probably closer to Like-New condition but I rated conservatively.  My collection has grown too large so I have to sell off several of my games. S_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;H is $7.00 to anywhere within the continental US.

I took it out of shrink when I bought it so as you can expect, very minor.  Game is in great shape.  Lots of nice pictures for Buffy fans.

    <notes>The game is opened, and the box has moderate shelf wear; with some scuffed edges and corners, and creases at the corners of the top and bottom.  However, that is the ONLY wear to the game, so the condition should really be considered better than very good.  Inside all the components are FACTORY SEALED!  All the cardboard pieces are UNPUNCHED!  The stickers used to make the die are still on their sheet.  The factory insert is also still present.  Nothing has ever been used!  So you get an absolutely, brand new game that only has shelf wear to the outside packaging.
Offers will also be considered.

    <notes>When I bought the game, it was the last copy in the toy store where I found it. However, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s really in great condition considering this. There is a very slight rip in the paper on the cover in one corner - probably measure just a few millimeters. Some dents on the cover and box bottom, in the corners, which is not unusual for cheaply-produced mass market US games. Everything else is in great condition, and I only played it a couple of times.
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not much of a difference in price, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll go priority. If you order several games from me, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll combine shipping.
Shipping cost is $6 to anywhere in the US (probably more if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;re in Alaska or Hawaii, but I have no experience in that area). If you order a bunch of stuff, the shipping cost is still $6! I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to make room here!</notes>

SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>This game is unpunched... probably due to being jostled around a bit some of the boards have come out of their places, but the majority are still firmly attached.  All punch boards are present with all boards in place.  The die are still in the sealed bag, stickers on original page, and components still sealed also.  The cards are split into two decks... not sure if they were originally in wrap or not.
The game has never been played, so the board is perfect as well.  Unfortunately the box had some sort of accident and has two torn corners on one of the short sides of the box.  With some inside corner work, the box would look in nice condition as there is minor damage to the box besides the tears.
I am listing this as Like New even though the box will make it not look that way, but due to the game being unpunched and the components unbagged I put it into this category.  The game comes from a smoke and animal free environment.
Thanks for looking!  Feel free to contact me with futher details on the game conditions.  I would keep and play it if I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have so many games and if I was into this genre.

    <notes>Game is complete.  Would actually list this in better condition, but the box is pretty beat up.  There is some dishing to the box lid.  There are scuffs and tears in the box lid and bottom.  There is one piece of tape (about 2_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; long) along the side of the box lid.  But, if you want a game that is complete and can live with a less-than-beautiful box, this could be a great deal!</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Description: Buffy the Vampire Slayer board game from Hasbro. Game is unpunched/unused and is in mint condition except for the box being a bit bowed/worn.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. Shipping can be calculated by adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials from US zip code 60134. We ship via either the USPS or UPS.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For one game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>Box: (G) There is moderate whiting, at least one small crease near a corner, and very slight bowing in one corner of the box_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s bottom.  However, the integrity and overall appearance of the box is absolutely fine, no blown or crushed corners, no noticeable warping, and no major marring.
Components: (VG-) The components are in VERY GOOD shape.  The only component that shows wear is the cardboard moon phase chart due to its tabs being pushed into the plastic stands.  However, there is one missing piece, a plastic evil pawn holder, which can be easily substituted with any slotted pawn holder.

    <notes>All game components are complete and this game has never been played-- some cards are still sealed, some dice haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t had their stickers applied yet. I counted the parts that are opened and confirmed they are complete. The cards that are opened are bowed slightly, but this should not affect game play. The box insert, if there was one, is missing. The box is in very good condition, with no split corners or dishing, and just a bit of shelfwear.
Buyer to pay shipping, actual shipping cost only. Amount to be determined by buyer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s zip code and package weight. </notes>

New in shrink-wrap. There is a 1 inch round rip in the shrink on top (no damage to game box cover) and a couple other small/minor shelf wear in shrink. Also note that tightness of shrink concaves slightly the box cover which is obviously of a typical MB thin card stock box cover.</notes>

    <notes>Item Name: Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game
Description: Buffy the Vampire Slayer game used/complete and in great shape.
Shipping Weight: 4 lbs
Orders are usually shipped within one business day of receiving payment. You can calculate the shipping cost at usps.com / ups.com by choosing 60134 as the sending zip code and adding the weights of all games purchased together (yes, we do combine items for shipping so take a look at our other games as the cost of shipping that second or third game is small compared to the first one) and adding 1 pound for packaging materials. I will ship via whatever method you prefer.
International buyers please note... shipping overseas is EXPENSIVE. For that first game (unless it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tiny) it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be no less than $30... additional games don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t add much to that, but shipping just one game is costly. Please be aware of that before placing an order.</notes>

    <notes>When we first started playing the game, I was worried that the circular phase track (you clip it to the board) would wear out.  So I emailed Hasbro and purchased 2 new sheets of components.  It is the phase track and all of the thick cardboard components.  These 2 sheets are unpunched (after a brief period of playing the game constantly, my kids lost interest and it was never played with again).  I will send these with all of the original components.  The box is sturdy, but it has normal shelf wear.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>Overall in good condition. The component in the worst shape is the box, which has shelfwear on the corners and edges and is slightly bowed but is still structurally intact and has no split corners. The game was already missing the original rulebook when I acquired it, but a printout of the rulebook is included. Everything else is in good to very good condition.</notes>

    <notes>This game is in good top very good condition.
Every component has been counted, using the BGG component list (more complete than the manual) and this game is complete. 
Box has minor scuffing and shelf wear.
Cards have thin card stock, so they have curled (?) a little, but no bending.
For European Rob Daviau fans, this is a unique item.
See pictures.</notes>

    <notes>In good to fair condition. The box is bowed on the top, and there is shelfwear on the box and corners. The cards are made of thin stock and show that they have been played (some of them don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t lay perfectly flat, but you can probably be able to fix this by gently bending them). One of the cards (artifact I think) has a vertical rip in it about an inch long, which has been taped but you can tell from the back of the card that there was a rip in it (you will either have to choose to ignore the rip, or pretend not to see it when playing; I do think you could make the noticeable part of the rip on the back of the card pretty much disappear if you touched up the back of the card with a yellow marker). Also Buffy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s standee got scrunched, she still stands, but one side is creased. Everything else is there and in very good to excellent condition.</notes>

    <notes>Box has a little dishing to the lid. Components are used and showing their age a bit. The following cards are missing:
3 Artifact cards:
Judge’s Arm
Military Costume
Moon Stone
1 Explosives card
The game is still playable and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s easy enough to work around the missing artifact cards since they aren_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t used in every game.
