   <description>EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a standalone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Front_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;fog of war_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

POSTAGE COST:
UK postage:  £5.50
European Postage: £8.50
Rest of World Postage: £16.50
Any buyers in and around London are welcome to collect in person (cash on collection).
COMBINED SHIPPING:
I will always combine multiple items to reduce your shipping costs where possible.  Please note that it is NOT always cheaper to combine shipping on games outside the UK due to the weight limit of 2KG on the Small Packet service. As a rough approximation, outside the UK it is usually cheaper to combine 5 or more games, while 4 or less are best sent individually.  This depends entirely on the specific games - please contact me before buying if you wish to purchase multiple games so that I can give you an accurate shipping cost.
ABOUT ME:
I have been playing and collecting games for over 25 years and I also sell games and magazines on ebay with the same username (saabdastard) where I have a 100% positive rating and a feedback score of over 4000.

SHIPPING:
Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs. Europe and Rest of World rates shown above are for Airmail.

There is no real difference between Air and Surface rates for Europe.

Insurance is optional on all items, unless noted. Failure to take out optional insurance limits my liability for loss or damage in the mail to the amount automatically covered by Royal Mail (currently £36 per package for Small Packets, £150 for International Standard).

Box: light shelf-wear. There is a small smudge on the back of the slipcase. Overall the box is in excellent+ condition!
Contents: Complete and like new! The game is the 1st Edition, but I have included a print-out of the 2nd Edition rules (there are spots where key rules are underlined in the printed-out manual).
SHIPPING
U.S. shipping will be via USPS Priority Shipping and based on a weight of 4 Lbs. International buyers are very welcome, but please contact me for a shipping price quote to avoid any surprises or misunderstandings.
I will gladly combine shipping for multiple purchases. The final cost will be based on the total weight, but be aware that large packages that are shipped more than a certain distance accrue a large surcharge, so combining shipping may not save any money.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the first edition - Version 3 which includes version 3 of the rules (copyright 2000) in the box.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not going to call this like new, because the labels have been applied.  The game contents are in excellent condition and appear to be unplayed.  I bought it secondhand, and never played it, just unfolded it and looked at the map.  I checked it pretty carefully and cannot see any wear on any of the game contents.
I checked the blocks and all the labels have been cleanly applied and and centered.  There are 4 extra blocks 2 black and 2 red.  The counters/markers are all crisp.  There is tufting in the corner where they came out of the counter sheet.  
There is no marking or wear on the counters or the rulebook.  The rulebook appears to be unread or very gently read.  There is a second copy of the rulebook included.  This has been 3 hole punched to go in a binder.
The dice are not original  There are four blue speckled dice, high quality, but not the originals (I checked against photos here).  
The game sleeve with the artwork has some rubbing wear, and light dirt marks.  There are no tears or holes in the cover, just wear from sitting on a shelf.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d call the game sleeve very good, the generic black Columbia box has no wear and is in excellent condition.
Summary: Game is complete.  Contents unmarked _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; excellent, without wear. Dice are replacements. Box sleeve has noticeable whiting, and some dirt marks.  Photos available upon request.
International buyers welcome.  This game weighs a little over 2 lbs, so it can go overseas first class rather than priority.  US shipping will be via a priority flat rate box, unless you have a strong preference for parcel post.</notes>

    <notes>EastFront AND Volga Front!!  Volga Front has never been played and is essentially new.  The box shows some shelf wear, but all corners are tight.  The components are in excellent condition.  The game comes with two rules books: one has tidy highlighting, the other is like new.  I will ship USPS medium flat rate, $13.60, so it will have a tracking number.</notes>
