   <description>In 1949, this incessant war has been raging for 35 years and finally a secret archaeological dig has delivered to the Obscura Korps a long sought ancient relic. This artifact is thought to guard an ancient parcel of knowledge. The exact emplacement of one of the four dark cardinal corners of reality is on the verge of being revealed._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A portal leading to hell, this un-sanctified zone is found buried within the secular crypt of a fortress situated in the heart of central Europe.

Shipping and Handling is for USPS Priority within the US. I can ship FedEx ground for a lower shipping rate (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d wager under $10, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d have to check it.)
For international, geekmail me the details and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll give you a quote.

    <notes>Opened but never played, in excellent condition. Everything is unpunched.  This also includes the hard to find revised rulebook, as well as the Wolf figure and the Yula figure (both are still in their boxes and never played).  Huge lot to get you started on the game!  Gotta clear some games out to make room for new ones, so my loss is your gain. Shipping is $10.00. If you purchase more than one game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll consolidate packages to save shipping . Paypal only please. And sorry, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sell to buyers outside of the US.
Thanks for looking.

    <notes>Game is in mint condition and is complete and sorted (in mini-ziplocs, except if there is a sorting tray).
I need to make space and get rid of games I am unlikely to play in the future.  Please check my other listings!  If you buy more than US$100 worth of games, I will give $10 off shipping.  If you buy more than $200 worth of games, I will ship the games for free (in the continental US only)! Games are being sold because I have an updated edition or am unlikely to play again in the future due to my group’s preferences.  Happy shopping!

    <notes>Description
It is 1949, and the Great War has been raging for 35 long years. A secret archaeological dig has just uncovered a powerful relic and delivered it to the Obscura Korps, agents of the Reich_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s military aristocracy. This artifact holds the key to information that the Reich has sought for years: the location of one of the four dark cardinal corners of reality. Parachuted behind enemy lines, a fistful of men and women are all the Union has left to thwart this peculiar menace. The Unions finest trained commandos armed with technology still in its experimental stages, the glory bound 42nd Alter-Marine Special Forces must now face the most terrible danger to face humanity in recorded history.

    <notes>Hi,
this is the first edition copy purchased from Fantasy Flight at Essen´07. The game is the english version.
The box has a split corner and the gameboard shows minor damages, which will not affect the game itself. 
All game materials are in excelent condition and in the box. I only played it a few times.
Feel free to contact me.

    <notes>Minor wear and tear to the box and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s corners. Components in very good condition, although THE ORIGINAL RULEBOOK IS NOT INCLUDED! I have printed a version of the Revised edition rulebook and the allied _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; axis character sheets, which DO COME IN THE BOX. I will also email the buyer the PDF version of the Revised Edition rules. So a better deal for you, right? :)</notes>

    <notes>This is a complete set of Tannhuaser - everything except the ridiculous tiny equipment cards.  All expansions, miniatures, etc.  A couple extra miniature expansions as well.
Please note this **does not** have the original boxes.  I consolidated everything into a large, very nice organizer to make playing and storage easier.
Game is in like new condition - played only a couple of time.
Just cannot find anyone in my area willing to play and unfortunately it doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make a good solo game.

    <notes>Tannhauser and the Operation Nogorod expansion were from a previous math trade. Components are in somewhat good condition, except for the following: 
- Revised Rulebook binding is loose 
- The top box on the Tannhauser cover box has one of the corners split open 
- It does come with the Equipment cards 
- Some of the character boards are slightly warped, but playable. 
- One of the box inserts is cracked, although it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s useless and I highly suggest to use what_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s on the photo here since the game has numerous components. 
The plastic organizers you see there will come with the purchase. 
Operation Hinansho was a more recent purchase and the board hasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been played once. I also purchased additional units as shown in the photo. These are new and their boards are not warped. 
I also have laminated player aids, also a copy of the rules of the Quick-N-Dirty variant that is posted on BGG, and additional D10 dice.

Main detractor is that the rulebook has partially separated at the spine as shown, however no pages are loose or torn. I remember reading that this was a common problem with these books. Box has a dent to one corner as shown.
Contact me for shipping info, and we will figure out the best way to ship to your location.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the complete collection with only the base game, equipment cards and a character expansion or 2 being open/played. Everything else is new/sealed. The equipment cards expansion is stored in the base game box. All other expansions are in their respective packaging. The base game does include the revised rulebook. There is also a second copy of a couple character expansions like frankenstahl.
This is ALOT of items and is somewhat heavy. Will not fit into a flat rate box so be prepared for the cost of shipping.</notes>

    <notes>This is everything. It includes the equipment cards and a digital copy of the revised rules. In addition, it includes 2 copies of the Frankenstahls, 2 copies of the Matriarchy troop pack, and 2 copies of the shogunate troop pack. This allows you to run 2 Frankenstahls or 2 of the other generic troopers. All of the other expansions are also included, including:
Asteros, Daedalus, Edison, Gorgei, Hoax, Hoss, Iroh, Itami, Mizu, Natalya, Oksana, Operation Hinansho, Operation Novgorod, Ramirez, Reich Troop Pack, Union Troop Pack, Wolf, Yula, and the aforementioned shogunate, matriarchy, and frankenstahl troop packs x 2 and the equipment cards.
Cardboard tokens are still unpunched. Everything has been consolidated into the main box and operation Novgorod box, except the equipment cards, which are still in their original packaging. Never played the game.
Everything together weighs about 17 lbs.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling this to pay for emergency dental surgery for a pet.

To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . 
Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.
[size=14][b][u]Condition Notes:[/u][/b][/size] 
Smoke-free home. No longer in shrink but unpunched/unused/unplayed. The rules look like they have been read, but everything else is still sealed and/or unpunched. However, the box top has a dinged corner and there is a compression mark on on side of the box top (looks like a heavy game was set on the edge of the box top. Retains structural integrity, but clearly dinged. Otherwise, excellent condition.
[b][u]Edition Notes:[/u][/b] English.
[size=14][b][u]Shipping Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually large (even though it is NOT super heavy).
I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).
When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).
[size=14][b][u]Payment Notes:[/u][/b][/size]
**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.
[b][i]US buyers:[/i][/b]
When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.
See the [i][b]Info from Seller[/b][/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameaccessory/140946/tannhauser-equipment-cards
I like to give an accurate description of all games I sell (just easier for everyone especially for a rarer game). 
I received this game from a trade but I myself have never played it beyond just setting it up. The box has wear on it (corner and some indentation on the bottom) but it still very sturdy. All the cards and components are in great condition. The board has slight wear on the corners.  The wolf expansion character does not come with the original box but the figure, stat card, and equipment are in the main box. The hoax expansion character original box has scuff marks on the front.</notes>
