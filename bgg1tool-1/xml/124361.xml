   <description>Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    They allow a player to choose actions during the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO499)
2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor - all to gain the chance to emerge victorious! CONCORDIA is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2 to 5 players age 13 and up. Instead of luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! </notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO499)
 2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor - all to gain the chance to emerge victorious! CONCORDIA is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2 to 5 players age 13 and up. Instead of luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them!

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO499)
2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor - all to gain the chance to emerge victorious! CONCORDIA is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2 to 5 players age 13 and up. Instead of luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them!</notes>

    <notes>Played once, the game is in EXCELLENT, I would say, punched, like new condition. There is a small dent on one of the corners of the box (Amazon delivered like this).  I accept Amazon gift cards. I have sold (and bought) a couple of times on BGG before, check sales history. 
You pay actual shipping (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m in Lafayette LA - 70503).
Bonus offer: Pay $10 more and get Dominion (punched like new condition) in the same package.</notes>

    <notes>Played twice, solo. Everything is in great shape. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve had a hard time getting this played, and it seems like plenty of people want the game but can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find it. So, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m taking advantage of the market as I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to sell something to cover getting Diceborn Heroes on Kickstarter.
I ship USPS Priority, though local pickup around Brunswick, ME works too.</notes>

Please note tractable insured shipping from USA is based on air rate and sticker shock should be expected. I also reserve the right to not ship to countries with know shipping/custom issues, so please GM me prior to purchasing items for confirmation.

    <notes>I can ship via DPD, DHL or Bpost, whatever works best for you. I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t make money on shipping, so you can look up online the price to your location. Within the Benelux is 7 euro, and to Germany is 10 euro with DPD. Bit cheaper if you send to a pickup location, rather than your house.</notes>
