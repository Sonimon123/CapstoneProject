   <description>Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example)._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;A rare poster-magazine called _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Sinkadus_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; 41# _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Complete with extra figures and scoring pegs (I have no idea why, but more is always better).  Box has some shelf wear.  Must have been very seldom played as all the corporation sheets have few to none of their holes punched.  The components are accounted as follows:
10 hero figures (complete)
38 legion figures: (+11 extra)
12 legionnaires (complete)
9 necromutants (11 extra)
3 centurions (complete)
2 razider (complete)
1 nepharite (complete)
1 ezoghoul (complete and assembled)
84 cards: (complete)
36 equipment cards (complete)
13 event cards (complete)
12 force cards (complete)
13 doomtrooper cards (complete)
10 secondary mission cards (complete)
three demensional citadel (complete)
8 gameboard room pieces (complete)
plastic stairs inlay (complete)
5 hero trays (complete)
5 hero sheets (complete)
rules book (complete)
mission book (complete)
sticker sheet (present; stickers already applied)
6 reference cards (complete)
5 corporation markers (complete)
9 dice (complete)
35 scoring pegs (+5 extra)
All the components are still very high quality, again most likely due to seldom play.  I live in a smoke-free, animal-free house.
Shipping will be $10 anywhere in the continental US.
I prefer PayPal, but will accept personal/cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s checks.</notes>

Good:
Figures, all present save 4. [SEE BELOW] No broken pieces or damage to figures. 
Acceptable:
Box cover is split in two corners and has water damage at one end. Box bottom is fine.
Missing:
-4 hero figures are missing. I have figures of the right color (from another SoTC set) but not the correct _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;poses._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; 
-Stickers for back of hero figures. This is not critical, as the figures are all different colors. </notes>

    <notes>This is a banged up copy of Mutant Chronicles for someone who would like to play the game without paying the high price of a new copy.  The box is banged up and taped; the figures are badly painted; and there a couple of missing and broken figures.  All of the game components (except a couple of the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;monster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;  figures) are in tact and very playable.  </notes>

    <notes>Free to a good or even acceptable home.
I actually have two copies.  You get both.  The first is basically unopened.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing the box shrinkwrap, but the figures and dice are still in their plastic bags and the board pieces haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been punched out.  The box is a little battered due to all the moves it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been through.
The second is in worse shape, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve opened the bags and half painted a number of the figures and I think I lost the skeleton guy with the chainsaw glaive.  However, you want the nice copy, you need to take the half painted rifled through one too.
I never played these.  I found them on deep sale in a Toys _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;R_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; Us and bought for the figures.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m trying to free up some space in the house and will happily mail these to someone who_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll play them.  I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want any money I just want them out of the house.  If you live outside the US let me know and if the shipping is reasonable I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll send them to you.</notes>

    <notes>Game is in very good condition, 100% complete and components neatly separated and bagged very nicely. 
The box is also in very good condition, but has one clean split corner on side top of box. Still very solid with only slight shelf wear.
MInis are unpainted. They fit snugly in their stands, but they are not glued in, so plenty of opportunity to paint and/or customize these any way you like.
Might not have ever even been played, two of the character sheets haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been pegged.</notes>

    <notes>This is a brand new copy still in the original shrinkwrap!!!  There is no damage to the box.  You will be very hard pressed to find an untouched copy of this game any more.  Price does not include shipping, but I only charge the actual cost to ship and nothing else.  I carefully pack the game to protect it too.
If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me and thanks for looking.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll ship worldwide, but be aware that shipping will be high outside of the United States.
NOTE:  The attached pictures are from my open game that I play with just to show you what the game looks like.  As noted above the game I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling is still in the original shrink!</notes>

Flaws as follows:
Box top has two broken seams.
2 Centurion minis (out of 9)have had their bayonets broken off.
Otherwise, game looks unplayed.  Cards are in _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition.  Photos available on request and will be posted later if I decide to list the game on BGG Marketplace.

    <notes>So this is a complete game with spare parts that I pieced together from two copies I acquired from others. Would like to play it but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s just getting lost in a sea of games on my shelf.
1) I have both boxes. Both have seen heavy use. One has a blown out corner (pictured). The other is intact but has clear packing tape on some corners. The worst box is pictured.
2) The complete set of cards has been sleeved using Mayday sleeves (not the premium kind). There is a partial deck of spare cards that I have not sleeved. 
3) There is a complete set of miniatures pieced together from two incomplete sets. Some were primed (now grey) by a previous owner. The balance are their original color. Three Necromutants have broken rifle tips. I never received the broken parts so I had no way to repair them. I also have a few spare miniatures. On miniature is missing its base. Everything is pictured, though the spares are a bit harder to see in one of the photos.
4) There is one complete set of dice plus a few spares.
5) All of the map tiles for two games are present. Both Citadel plastic foundations are present, as well as both sets of the cardboard Citadel structure.
6) There is one complete set of player aid/reference cards.
7) There are two complete sets of Doomtrooper reference boards.
8) There is one unopened package of pegs.
9) There is one set of Rules and Mission Booklet.
10) There is one complete Doomtrooper sticker sheet.
11) There are 5 cardboard Doomtrooper faction icons and 4 slotted rectangular cardboard tokens (pictured).
Sorry that some of the pictures are fuzzy. If you are interested in seeing better pictures, let me know and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll see if I can provide clearer photos.
It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s definitely a playable copy. It looks used. Expect cardboard to show some creases and edgewear. Same with the cards. Outside of the damage described above to a few Necromutants, the complete set of miniatures are in great shape. Some of the spares are whole and in great condition as well.
I am selling this all as one lot. If you want to buy it but don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want everything (maybe to save on shipping) I will most likely throw away whatever you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want. If you want me to toss the box in the worst condition I will still have to package most of the spare parts outside of the other game box as they will not fit.
