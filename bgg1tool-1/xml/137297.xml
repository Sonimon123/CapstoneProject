   <description>In Augustus, you vie with your fellow players to complete _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;objective_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; cards for special powers and ultimately for victory points. Each card has 2-6 symbols which you must populate with legionnaire meeples in order to complete the card. These symbols are drawn one at a time from a bag, with all players gaining the benefit equally, but interestingly, the bag contains more of some symbols than others._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;So the pivotal skill you'll deploy is in making your choice of which three objectives you'll start the game with (you're dealt six) _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; balancing potential difficulty of completion against value of the reward _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;mdash; and then which of five available objectives you'll add to your plate each time you complete one of your three. The game ends when someone completes seven objectives._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Picked up one of the few copies at Origins (10 or less sold there). Played once. Loved it and think it will win SdJ, but willing to wait until GenCon to get another copy if you want this one. Paid $40 (extra $2 just about covers BGG and Paypal fees)
Will ship in USPS Medium Flat Rate Priority box ($12.35 - includes tracking)
International edition (just means there are LOTS of foreign language rules sets in this copy -- including English)</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMAUG01US)
Serving the 1st Roman Emperor, Augustus, you will need to mobilize your legions to control provinces of the Empire and its senators to ultimately obtain the title of Consul. The aim of the game is to earn as many points as possible before any players has taken control of seven objectives. Throughout the game play, players must strategize so as to manage the risk of claiming the rewards that are available to them in order to maximize the points gained. Players also have the opportunity to wreak havoc with their opponents by causing them to lose some of their legions or objectives, thus foiling their plans on becoming the next Consul! </notes>

    <notes>Located in Toronto, I won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t ship these games. Cash in person deals only.
I am cleaning out my games collection selling games that I got in 2013. All are in great condition, check out my other listings. As many of these games are review copies that I have been provided with by publishers, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll donate all proceedings to a local soup kitchen/food bank.
I can meet in Toronto and work near Pearson airport.</notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMAUG01US)
Serving the 1st Roman Emperor, Augustus, you will need to mobilize your legions to control provinces of the Empire and its senators to ultimately obtain the title of Consul. The aim of the game is to earn as many points as possible before any players has taken control of seven objectives. Throughout the game play, players must strategize so as to manage the risk of claiming the rewards that are available to them in order to maximize the points gained. Players also have the opportunity to wreak havoc with their opponents by causing them to lose some of their legions or objectives, thus foiling their plans on becoming the next Consul!</notes>
