    <notes>My copy has only been played once.  Everything is included and in true, like new condition.  I have even included print-outs of some popular game variations along with 4 handy reference cards (nicely mounted on cardstock).  I will calculate shipping per zip code but it will probably be about $10.00. Let me know if you have any questions. </notes>

    <notes>Never played.  In fact, the bags have never been openned.  My wofe bought me the game and suprised me with it, showing me the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ring_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; on her finger.
Unfortunately, it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t a game I wanted.  
So, that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s why this is _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;like new_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;.  (1) It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s missing the plastic wrap.  (2) The plastic bag containing the ring was opened.
Otherwise, it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mint.</notes>

    <notes>This is the Lord of the Rings Risk Trilogy Edition game from 2003.  The game is in very good condition (very close to new).  I opened the game, punched out the cards etc, and played the game only one time.  It has sat in my closet ever since playing it that one time.  It has no damage at all (has been stored in a dry and safe environment) and is 100% complete (has all the pieces including the little pewter ring that comes with it).</notes>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Parker Brothers, 2003 - Risk: Lord of the Rings (Trilogy Edition) - COMPLETE/UNPLAYED, yes the (1) ring is included. Outer Box is in good condition with (1) taped corner and a compression crease running along (1) side (about 4.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length) there are also a couple of small _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;dings_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on that same side (not bad but needs mentioned). Interior contents are in unplayed/unpunched condition. Board is very clean and crips.  Almost everything is still sealed.  NOTE: (2) of the army colors have been opened along with the ring but, everything else is still sealed; other (2) armies, cards and dice.  Bottom box has only minimal shelfwear and a very light crease near one of the sides (about 3_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in length).  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 4.5 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon</notes>

    <notes>Up for your review is a board game by Parker Brothers, 2003 - Risk: Lord of the Rings, Trilogy Edition - COMPLETE/CONTENTS SEALED.  Outer box has only minimal shelfwear (mostly in the corners).  There is a light puncture on the bottom box (extreme left side (about 0.18_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 0.18_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; in size) not bad but needs mentioned.  There is also a small bit of price tag residue on one of the long edges (about 1_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; x 0.5_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;).  Interior contents are in excellent condition.  All contents are still sealed; armies, cards, dice _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; ring.  Board is very crisp and solid.  Note: shrinkwrap is removed from cover but all interior contents are still sealed.  See actual item photos below for further detail. This game will weigh around 4.75 pounds once it has been packaged for shipping. I will combine multiple purchases being shipped to the same address. Feel free to pm me with any questions you may have in regard to the game listed above. 
Errors:
I try to be as accurate in item description as possible however, I may miss or overlook something with the game listed above. Any oversight is purely accidental and not meant to defraud the buyer in anyway. I will try to work out those errors when possible and I do accept returned items as a last resort (with full payment refunded, minus BGG fees), however postage for the returned item is the buyers responsibility. All items are sold _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;as-is_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;.
Payment:
For domestic orders (US) I prefer payment through money order or check but will also accept paypal if need be. For international orders I prefer payment to be made through paypal. I will email you once payment has been received and again once your item has shipped (with delivery confirmation). 
Shipping:
Shipping will be actual charges plus $1.85 (for packing _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; delivery conformation). Insurance is optional but recommended. If I do end up overcharging I will simply upgrade to the next shipping rate (i.e. parcel post _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt; priority). I always ship items with delivery confirmation.
About Me: 
I have been a member of BGG for several years but have done all my selling of vintage and OOP board games on Ebay. Since last year (march ‘08) when their site went through radical modifications it became too expensive and risky in my estimation to continue business through their site. You can look up my user id: junkfield - by going to the community page on their website and read over my 100% positive feedbacks. I appreciate your interest in this game and look forward to selling through BGG. 
Thanks,
Jon

    <notes>All game materials present and in great condition (including the ring). It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the BOX that_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s giving me a headache. I bought this on ebay (I know, how stupid am I?) because it was advertised as NEW. The box has no splits or punctures, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s been taped shut at least two separate times, and where there isn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t tape there_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s tape residue that is sticky as all hell. So how_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s that for full disclosure? I am geekily anal about my games, so having this in my house keeps me awake at night. Seriously. I just want to recoup some of my ebay loss, so all I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m asking is $15. Shipping will most likely be $10. If you don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t care about the box, or need components, come get it. The board _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; figs are completely mint.

    <notes>Opened, used copy of Risk: The Lord of the Rings - Trilogy Edition. Included is one of the armies from the earlier edition of the game that can be used as a fifth player. (The light yellow army is different enough from the Trilogy edition_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s mustard-yellow that it should be easy to tell them apart on the game board.)

    <notes>excellent box (htf) and verified complete - I have a couple of spare parts copies and count out all 90 pieces for each army set - missing and/or broken pieces are replaced and I typically toss in an extra of the little guys (61). I go through both card decks and do the same, i.e. maligned cards are replaced from the replacement pool. Rules and board excellent. No ring...what I will do is replace lost pieces and/or cards for you into the future. No boards,rules or box though...if you need a replacement board $10 shipped domestic.</notes>

And because someone will ask if I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t say it explicitly, game is complete.

    <notes>The outside shrink has been removed, but all contents inside are factory wrapped/sealed. 
This includes the dice and armies (sealed in bags), the cards (shrink wrapped), and most importantly, the ever elusive ONE RING (loose).
Box itself is in great shape. I am confident that you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find one in better condition without paying the crazy prices for purchasing one that is entirely sealed.
Shipping will be about $13.
(Really good game by the way, but I am sure you know that if you are here.)</notes>

    <notes>Box in good shape. Missing rules and One Ring. Includes B_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;W print out of rules. Two armies have twice as many pieces and three flags (leaders) instead of two. I believe this is to allow two player games vs three or four players, but am not sure. May be missing a few of the army pieces, but not enough to affect play, if any. All dice/cards present. Components in excellent shape. I am happy to send just the components if you are trying to complete/enhance another copy (will save on shipping).</notes>

    <notes>Beat up! Corner of box looks like it was chewed on by something (hopefully not someone)! Map has a rip at fold where peeling. One of the red dice replaced with a white one. Inventory list included with the game seems to indicate that the following are missing: 3 Red, 4 Black, 5 Green _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; 7 Yellow.
Good things!
Includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;ONE RING_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;!!!
Has instructions.
This is a playable game! Not going to look pretty on the shelf, but you can play the game. Did I mention it includes the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;One Ring_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;!!!
