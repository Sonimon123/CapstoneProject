   <description>Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

Think you can reveal the most Rose cards without ever discovering a Skull card? Think you have nerves of steel?
From a hand of 4 cards, players get to either play or, after a first round, start issuing challenges. That_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s when you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll need to bluff your heart out by claiming you can flip a number of cards over without revealing a Skull - then other players can try to outdo you by bragging about revealing more cards... until someone gets called on it and has to pull it off!
Starting with one of his or her own cards, that player has to flip as many cards as was bragged about. And if a Skull is revealed, then that player fails... AND LOSES A CARD FROM THEIR HAND!
Whoever manages to win at two challenges, or is the last person with a card left, wins!
So play your Skull at the right time, force your opponents to overbid, and bluff like you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve never bluffed before!</notes>

Find the roses and avoid the skulls with only daring bluffs and raw grit.
Tension mounts as you play your cards, one at a time, around the table and around again. Do you dare to try your luck? Will you raise the stakes or fold under the heat? Do you have the guts to make a grab for the rose, or will you back down and hope your foes get stuck with the grinning skull?
In Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Roses, the game of crafty bluffs and steel nerves, you’ll take turns placing your cards in front of you, hidden to everyone but yourself. Slap down your roses or sneak your skull into the pile. When the time is right, muster your courage and challenge for the right to start flipping cards. Bid high to scare off the competition, or bid low to make someone else raise the stakes. But most of all, hide your tells and bluff like there’s no tomorrow, because in this game, guessing right is just as important as making everyone else guess wrong. It only takes two successful challenges to win the game, but can you find the roses before you wind up holding the skull?
Skull _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Roses is a tense game of tactics, strategy and plain-old bluffing your heart out. Gritty art inspired by biker tattoos will draw you into the game, and easy rules will have you playing right away. It’s bold and smart and most of all, it’s just plain fun.

An ancient game of ornate skulls and dangerous roses, Skull is simple to learn but dangerously difficult to win. You must bluff, lie and pierce through the deceptions to expose the roses. Be wary, though - if you happen across a skull, the consequences are dire! Players will hold three rose cards and one skull. Add a card to the pile in front of you, and when you feel lucky, announce your challenge and declare how many cards you will flip. Cards that show a rose are safe, but if you expose your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hidden skull, you lose one of your own cards. Keep your cards to the bitter end to win this clever game of deception and perception! </notes>

    <notes>Asmodee (ASMSKR01N)
An ancient game of ornate skulls and dangerous roses, Skull is simple to learn but dangerously difficult to win. You must bluff, lie and pierce through the deceptions to expose the roses. Be wary, though - if you happen across a skull, the consequences are dire! Players will hold three rose cards and one skull. Add a card to the pile in front of you, and when you feel lucky, announce your challenge and declare how many cards you will flip. Cards that show a rose are safe, but if you expose your opponent_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s hidden skull, you lose one of your own cards. Keep your cards to the bitter end to win this clever game of deception and perception!</notes>

    <notes>New in shrink.  No necessary in-game text, so just print off the rules (available on line), and it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s the same.  Or just read them once or watch a video - really almost no rules are needed on hand after you play this for five minutes.  I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll be happy to provide a copy if you ask.
There is a very small amount of bowing on one of the sides of this box. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s so slight that I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t think a photo can capture it, I just thought I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d mention it instead of letting it pass unmentioned.
Small box = fairly cheap shipping.</notes>
