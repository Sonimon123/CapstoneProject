Shipping _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; Handling:
Germany: 7 Euro
International: please ask me in advance (before clicking _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;BUY!_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;) with your mailing priorities (land/surface etc.). Please note that the Deutsche Post (www.deutschepost.de, language may be switched to english) is rather expensive (E.g. roughly 2x more expensive to send from Germany to US when vice versa).
I attend the GHS Con at Braunfels (Germany), thus if you also attend you may pick up the game there.

Also includes the SPQR Players Guide (I included this because I can_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t find a listing for it on Board Game Geek).</notes>

This includes the Player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Guide, Pyrrhic Victory, Africanus, Consul for Rome, and War Elephant.

Shipping to the US is $7; please ask about foreign shipping.  If you want multiple items, each other GBOH game will cost an extra $2 to ship.  Personal checks must clear before item ships.</notes>

    <notes>2nd Edition _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;half deluxe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; unpunched with a 3rd edition 32 page print out. Original rules are missing as are the player aid cards so I went ahead and printed them out for you consuming about 20% of an ink cartridge(not cheap) AND augmented with the following materials from my 3CI collection;
Alexander in Italy, a hypothetical 2-game Module in C3i #5 (Great Battle of Alexander and Pyrrhic Victory needed)Battle of Castulo, 211 BC, the end of Publius Scipio, from C3i #5, Battle of Telamon, 225 BC, the Celtic War, from C3i #6, Mago: Youngest of the Lion_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Brood, Mago Barca in the 2nd Punic War, from C3i #6,Caralis: The Battle for Sardinia, 215 BC, from C3i #9,Variant Skirmishers, Velites and Light Troops including the 74 counters from 3CI #15 and more. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m tired. In short you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll receive in some cases less than the 3rd edition and other cases more. I also copied commentary and startegy articles when I came across them.</notes>

    <notes>The rules, maps, charts and leaders and combat units are present, but all the game markers are missing (the bag with them was in Caesar when that was sold, so lucky for somebody. I have added a bag of number counters for cohesion hits from another game and it may be played using markers from another GBoH game such as Alexander or Caesar. £5.00 P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P in the UK, £10.00 for the rest of the world. If bought with Consul For Rome, Pyrrhic Victory or Africanus their P_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;P will be free.</notes>
