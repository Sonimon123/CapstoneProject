    <notes>Flying Buffalo Inc. (FBI 6001)
A comical cataclysmic card game for 2-6 players of all ages. A humorous confrontation between touchy world powers as each player attempts to sway his opponents_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; populations with diplomacy, propaganda, and finally nuclear weaponry. Little old ladies defect in electric cars and the dread SUPERGERM spreads devastation! Takes about 10 minutes to learn and about 30 minutes to play. Invented by Doug Malewicki in 1965, this game has remained popular for over 40 years. Anyone who ever had to participate in a _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;civil defense drill_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; by hiding under his or her desk in grade school, or ever had a bomb shelter in the back yard should play this game. One of the few games where it is possible to have no winners (often everybody loses!). You have to play it to believe it. This game_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s a blast! It was chosen for Games Magazine_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Games 100_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; for 1984. _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;The quintessential `beer-and-pretzels_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; game: simple, fast, easy to learn, and loads of fun. Minimal prep time: shuffle the decks and deal._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; - Tim Kask, Adventure Gaming Magazine. (Boxed, 140 cards and spinner). </notes>

    <notes>This bundle includes the components of:
1) Nuclear War
2) Nuclear Escalation
3) Nuclear Proliferation
4) Weapons of Mass Destruction
5) 15 Nuclear War Booster packs
CARDS: The first 3 games have the original artwork.  I bought my copy of Nuclear Escalation used, so the cards have noticeably more wear (browning on edges), but are undamaged and very playable.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Proliferation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; cards have only been played a few times and are in good clean condition.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;WMD_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Booster_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; cards are unplayed and in excellent condition.  Many _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;rare_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; booster cards are included; email me if you want a list.
OTHER COMPONENTS: Includes 2 _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Nuclear Misfunction_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; dice.  The 9 country mats from Proliferation are included and are in good clean condition. Player mats from _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Escalation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; are in worse shape, but redundant if you use the country mats. Spinner mat from the original game is included, but spinner parts are missing.  Components are packed into boxes for _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;War_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; and _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Proliferation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; - _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;Escalation_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; box has been discarded.
Shipping will be via USPS Priority flat-rate, which is $9.85 to anywhere in the USA</notes>

    <notes>This is for 1st printing of Nuclear War from Flying Buffalo, 1965 edition on the box cover.  Flying Buffalo_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s name doesn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t appear on the box or in the game materials, but based on the designer_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s website this small white box with a red mushroom cloud was released in 1972 version).  From my research, I believe this the 1st printing of this edition by Flying Bufflow as this has a black box bottom and has rounded edge game cards.
The cards are lightly played and in very good condition.
Shipping is $5 to US, other locations please inquire.

Shipping Notes:
You are welcome to come to Community Game Night (see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/127654) and pick up your game in person and pay $0.00 for shipping.
Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewuser_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;username=RoamDog).
Please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, if you would like tracking information, also provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.
Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this will expedite delivery).
Payment Notes:
US buyers:
Preferred method of payment for all transactions is for me to receive a USPS money order from you (safest possible $$ transfer).
A good alternative is for me to receive an Amazon gift certificate from you (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white -- fast -- easy -- no extra charge to you or me).
Western Union transfer is also acceptable.
If the receiver (you) elects to NOT pay extra for insurance (decision is totally up to the receiver) then the receiver agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages (I cannot remember ever having a problem, but the risk is there).
Non-US buyers:
Gift certificate from Amazon (see https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order-email?ie=UTF8_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ref_=gc_lp_4ways_email_white) and Western Union wire transfer (see www.westernunion.com) are the only acceptable form of payment. Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.
Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.
Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s expense) for shipments to non-US addresses. Receivers outside the US must also agree to assume ALL responsibility for taxes, tariffs, customs duties, etc. If these terms are not acceptable, please do not order from me.
**Note that the offered price is the discounted price for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment. I do not really accept Paypal payments any more, but if you absolutely insist that Paypal is the only way that you can get the money to me, then please plan to pay an extra $0.50 plus and additional 5% of the total.</notes>
