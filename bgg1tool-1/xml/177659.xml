   <description>20 years after the end of The Manhattan Project, the superpowers of the world are embroiled in another vicious arms race. Manufacturing nukes is no longer an obstacle; all nations are now capable of churning them out at a rapid pace. The challenge of this era lies in the development of various delivery systems called the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Nuclear Triad:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; strategic bombers, ballistic subs, and land-based ballistic missiles._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Each player represents one of the superpowers in the arms race. At staged intervals, scoring is conducted in one of 4 categories:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Strategic Bombers_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Ballistic Submarines_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- ICBMs_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;- Short-range missiles deployed to third world nations_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In addition to earning points for deploying nukes during the scoring rounds, players can also earn defensive bonuses for mitigating the risks imposed against them._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;The game ends after all of the scoring events have been completed.

    <notes>The Manhattan Project 2: Minutes to Midnight. Add two minutes to midnight and you got yourself a game.
Very Good copy of the game. Components are sorted, bagged, and ready to play. Originally a kickstarter so it includes extras as well.
Game has never been played.
Comes from my personal collection and a smoke and pet-free home.
Shipping is priority mail in a medium flat rate box for $13.65.
Ask about combined shipping prior to purchase and I will hold you spot in the queue for a limited time.
Thanks for looking!</notes>
