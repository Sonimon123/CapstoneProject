The world of BattleLore meshes history and fantasy together - putting players in command of an array of miniature troops on the battlefields of a Medieval Europe Uchronia at the outset of the Hundred Years War._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Drawing on the strengths of Memoir '44, this Days of Wonder game takes the time-tested Command and Colors system to a new level and offers gamers of many backgrounds a chance to fight medieval battles with a dose of epic fantasy._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;In this fantastical re-imagining of the Hundred Years War, French and English armies are supplemented with Goblins and Dwarves mercenaries and even some creatures like the Giant Spider and the Earth Elemental! Just as important as the armies you have, though, are the Lore Masters you choose to aid you: Wizards, Clerics, Warriors and Rogues can all aid you with unique powers and spells in ways role-playing gamers will find familiar._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>Would list in Like New condition as the game has not been played.  However, the bottom corner of the box has been split (my daughter dropped it before I received it).  Includes the earth elemental promo figure as well as two plastic trays to hold the miniatures.  Comes from a smoke free house.
The game weighs 6.5 pounds and postage and handling will be no more than $15.
Thanks for looking!</notes>

BattleLore
Epic Fantasy Adventures
Dawn breaks cold and damp on the edge of a European forest as old as history itself.  Last night, your scouts stumbled upon the remains of a hastily departed Goblin camp.  Sure enough, this morning their Crescent banners are silhouetted companies of noblemen on their war mounts.  Will the forthcoming battle unfold as planned?  Are your vaunted Dwarven mercenaries worth their costly wages?  If you’ve chosen wisely, your place in history seems assured.  If not…surely your heirs will pay the ransom…won’t they?

    <notes>This is basic Battlelore plus the expansion Call to Arms.ThoughtHammer price for these two items is $65.00. I am selling both for $40.00 plus #10.00 shipping and handling(US ground...Priority mail slightly higher). Contains no promotional monsters.
        Game has been played 3 times; it is a fine game but plays a little too long for my taste.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG BL01)
Designed by Richard Borg, BattleLore is a briskly paced game for 2-4 players. The time is the Hundred Years War. All of Europe is engulfed in the flames of battle. Armies of French and English troops lined up alongside Goblin and Dwarven mercenaries. Mounted knights ride down on archers firing arrow after arrow to slow the advance. War Councils, armed with the power of Lore, cast spells of horrifying might. Will you take up a banner and march to war?</notes>

I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve removed all packaging but never played the game. The figures were never removed from the plastic box they come in. The Hill Giant and Earth Elemental were also never removed from their plastic shell packaging.
I prefer paypal, but will also accept check or money order (though it will be slower).
I ship by USPS parcel post with delivery confirmation. If you order several games from me, I will combine shipping.

I have owned this game for 3 yrs, but hardly ever find someone to play it with (my wife has endured her fair share of course).  I have consolidated all the pieces into the main box and the call to arms box.  Everything is in Good conditions, no missing pieces or parts.  I hope you enjoy.

    <notes>English version. Includes the Epic Battlelore expansion and Earth Elemental figure. Played several times but still in great shape. The only reason I listed as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; is due to shelf wear on the corners of the box and the cheap dice have the usual paint wear. Ask for estimate on shipping before buying.</notes>

    <notes>I got this as an extra - already own a base set.  The previous owner has undercoated (brown) many of the human cavalry, and the three creatures.  Some of the miniatures will need the warm water treatment to straighten - but this wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t out of the ordinary for new base sets.  Otherwise the remainder of the game is in great condition.
This comes with the Call to Arms Expansion, the Rock Elemental and the Hill Giant.</notes>

I put all pieces in small bags so that they are sorted and you can set up the game much faster. As with Memoir44 I am selling the game because i found out that i am not a wargame person and I don`t have much fun playing it.

    <notes>Fantasy Flight Games (FFG BL01F)
Core Set French Edition
In a world that bridges history and fantasy, BattleLore puts you in command of a vast array of miniature troops on the battlefields of Medieval Europe. Assembling a group of wizened old Lore Masters - men of faith and magic, tricksters and grizzled warriors - is only one of many challenges you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll face. The proper deployment of troops, careful choice of allies, timely spell-casting and good old fashioned treachery are all important skills to master.
The BattleLore Base Set includes hundreds of highly-detailed plastic miniatures, a large board and terrain overlay tiles, the battle dice and command cards that form the backbone of the Command and Colors system, a book of scenarios including basic scenarios and advanced scenarios for experienced players, and much more.

    <notes>I have to Battlelore lots available.  Marketplace price listing reflects Lot 1.
Battlelore lot #1:  This is for the DoW English language edition of Battlelore plus several expansions. The game materials are lightly played and in very good to like new condition. I do not have the original packaging for the expansions. The base game box is showing considerable shelfwear and the bottom box has one corner split but the game materials are in great shape.
This lot also includes the following expansions which are all the English language version in very good to like new condition (again, I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t have the original boxes/packaging):
Epic Battlelore
Call to Arms
Hill Giant promo
Earth Elemental promo
Dwarven Battalion
Goblin Skirmishers
Goblin Marauders
Hundred Years War
The figures are all currently stored in two 18 compartment plastic craft storage containers. I will include these in the lot if you want to cover the additional shipping. Otherwise, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll group the figures by type in plastic bags and send in the original box or in secure packing material outside the box.
Shipping for lot #1 is $13 to Eastern and Central US and $16 to Mountain and Pacific. I ship via USPS and always get delivery confirmation. Other countries please inquire, unfortunately this is heavy lot and cost will likely be high.
Lot #2:  This lot is available for $40 (if you want expansions, check out my individual listings which I can add for no additional shipping costs).  This is for a well played copy of the base game plus Call to Arms and Epic Battlelore expansion that I acquired from my local gaming club as it downsized its library.  The box is missing the storage insert.  The box has considerable shelf and edgewear and there is some splitting along the edges and corners of the box.  These corners can easily be reinforced and the box can remain quite functional.
The game is signed by Richard Borg and dated 7/6/07 which I know is authentic.
The game is complete except for the following:  Missing the 24 page adventure book (which is available for download on the Fantasy Flight website for downloading); the game is missing three banners--1 red standard swordsmand and 2 blue standard swordsman banners; missing 3 heavy infantry figures (of 16).  The game has three extr regular infantry figures, 1 extra human archer and 1 extra goblin skirmisher.
The cards have been played but show no excessive wear.  The board is in nice shape.  Figures are also in nice shape as well, although some of the mounted figures could use some straightening (which was a very common problem with this game). 
The Call to arms expansion is very lightly played; missing one of the blue feudal levy tokens, which is easily proxied if ever used.
The Epic Balttlelore expansion is complete and lightly worn.
Shipping for this lot will be $12 to Eastern and Central time zone and $14 to Mountain and Pacific. </notes>

The game has three extra regular infantry figures and 1 extra goblin skirmisher.  While the game is incomplete, there are going to be few, if any, circumstances where the missing materials matter and most all parts are easily proxied with other figures or banners.

    <notes>This is a great deal for the Out of Print DOW English edition (NOT a REPURPOSED copy, don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t settle!) of the base game and 3 expansions; Dragons, Creatures and Scottish Wars. Note that Creatures and Dragons are the 2009 FFG versions and are in full English, cards and rules. 
All sets were Hand counted to verify 100% complete. This is a really nice copy of the game that has been played maybe once or twice. The Lore cards are still in shrink, dice look like new, other cards crisp like new, everything looks great. Very cool expansions included give lots of extra variety and lots of Monsters like the dreaded Hydra, Dwarfs and Dragons! 
Even the Boxes show very little wear and are in excellent condition, the main box has almost has NO wear! All original boxes and inserts are included unless buyer requests otherwise (might make shipping more costly). 
Will be packed VERY carefully before shipping (see my feedback) feel free to ask questions or for a shipping quote. Shipping will be actual cost quoted by Post Office only nothing more and the method of your choice. </notes>

    <notes>Opened, but never played. Components still in shrink wrap. Original English edition (not the french repurposed).
I only chose _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Like New_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; because the shrink wrap has been removed.  There is some slight shelf/corner wear.  See the pictures for details.  I think the pictures magnify the wear, but if it is important to you you should expect it to be there.</notes>

Like new -- cards and tiles still in shrink.  _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Common_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; figures were removed from the cramped space and straightened in hot water -- will ship in a separate box to avoid rebending them.
The Days of Wonder web registration code has been registered and is no longer valid -- this had to be done to receive one of the promo figures and the replacement dice.
Please contact me with any questions or if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like pictures.  I realize that I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t sold on BGG before, but I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve been trading here and selling on ebay and rec.games.board for many years.</notes>

used. Out of print. Lightly played. Includes expansions _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; carrying case.
Well, I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve put off posting this one, but it has to be done. A friend and I have been trying to play this one and I recently bought a lot of expansions to supplement the base game. Unfortunately it is a two player game and we always had larger groups. 
The base game I have combined with a number of expansions and am including a very nice carrying case. I usually keep expansion boxes which in this case were a little flimsy, but I think I kept them. If you would like them, I will look for them. To clarify...The base game is in the box and the carrying case supplements what won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t fit in the box.
Included are color print outs of numerous scenarios players have devised. 
The expansions included: None of the expansions have been played.

    <notes>Selling as a bundle
I have the core battlelore game and I believe one of all the expansions. I have a few repurposed french sets. I can provide more details on request.
The core game is missing an insert as I have the pieces in a separate container. All pieces are in great shape. The expansions are all pretty much unplayed. I opened them and looked at them but havent had much chance to use them!
Shipping is 20$ due to size/weight.</notes>

No attempt has been made to straighten them, since none fall over (but the hot water then bend method has been reported as a successful way on the discussion boards). None of the figures have been painted. Shipping is $18.00 USD (large, heavy box) for U.S addresses.</notes>

Base game box looks like it was placed on a curtain rod, then had other games stacked on it, causing creasing along the left hand side of the bottom of the box.  Contents are undamaged and as originally packaged.  Cards are in shrink, and figures are in the formed plastic inserts.  All expansions are in shrink.

It is missing one piece and the box, but otherwise the figures are complete and in great condition.  Yep, a killer deal, but I lost my job and have to sell.  Includes Heroes and Dragons expansions.  Condition is near mint.  All cards sleeved.  The kicker is while you are slaying dwarves, you can feel good about helping me thru to my next gig!  Lol!</notes>

    <notes>This is for the Days of Wonder first edition.  I have included an additional set of dice and the Battlelore: Hill Giant figure.  I removed the shrinkwrap because I was hoping to include the additional dice and Hill Giant in the game box, but there was no spare room.  The cards and components are still factory sealed and the game was never played.  The Hill Giant is sealed.  The additional dice have never been played with.  Comes from a smoke-free home.</notes>

    <notes>This sale is pre-negotiated with hybridtracer - do not purchase if you are not him!
This set includes the following items for BattlelLore 1st Edition, all English versions:
One complete core set (the components are in near mint condition; the two books show light wear from use though the bindings are strong and there are no tears, folds, stains, etc).
One incomplete core set - about 30-50% of the miniatures are missing and there are no books, but it is has a complete set of cards, tiles, dice, along with another board, etc.  The spider is included.  The packaging for the incomplete core set is not included.
7 expansions, all new in shrink:
- Call to Arms
- Heroes
- Creatures
- Dragons
- Horrific Horde
- Bearded Brave
- Code of Chivalry
6 expansions opened, but the components are in near mint condition:
- Call to Arms
- Dwarven Battalion
- Goblin Marauders
- Goblin Skirmishers
- Scottish Wars
- Hundred Years_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039; War
Also included:
- Epic Battlelore (not in shrink, but the punchboard is still unpunched)
- Two copies of For Troll and Country (the maps are both near mint, one troll is still sealed in his blister, the other is loose with a broken banner, which could probably be fixed with glue).
- Both promos (Earth Elemental and Hill Giant), opened but complete with their original packaging and all components, all near mint.  Additionally, an extra Hill Giant is included without his package and missing one card, but otherwise near mint.
- 5 extra sets of brand new dice
The packaging for the BattleLore expansions is quite flimsy - the components for all of them look like new but some of the expansion packages have minor dings or other wear (they are all structurally sound and still look good).
Shipping will be $30.</notes>

    <notes>Ich verkaufe hier die deutsche Version von dem Brettspiel _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Battlelore_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; von dem Verlag Days of Wonder. Umzugsbedingt muss ich meine Sammlung verkleinern und muss mich schweren Herzens von diesem Klassiker trennen. Ich habe die Figuren und Spielmaterialien durschgeschaut und konnte keine fehlenden Elementen bemerken. Die Figuren habe ich in besondere Kunstoffboxen gepackt, da die mitgelieferten Kunststofffassungen sehr umständlich zu handhaben waren und die Spielbox sich dadurch nur sehr schlecht schließen ließ. Die Karten, Würfel und Figuren sind fast unbenutzt, der Karton hat an den Ecken leichte Gesbrauchsspuren (wie auf den Fotos zu erkennen).

    <notes>2006 Days of Wonder English edition. Fairly well played. The box shows moderate wear, but the components are all in very good condition.  
The biggest thing to consider is the previous owner single-color painted the otherwise gray miniatures in red, blue, green to more easily identify the unit strengths on the board. To differentiate the armies, he used solid colors for one and a silvery gloss (for lack of a better term, as I am not an expert on painting minis) for the other. You might still need to use the unit flags when you play, but perhaps not. Personally, I liked the effect.</notes>
