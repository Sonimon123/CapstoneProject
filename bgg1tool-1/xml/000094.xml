       <name primary="true" sortindex="1">Union Pacific</name>
         
   <description>Union Pacific is a train-themed stock market game.  On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.  Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart.  Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game.  The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implements:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Airlines_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Re-implemented as:_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;     Airlines Europe_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the German version, but it has English rules.  I played this with my friend a few years back, and he didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t like it and sold it to me.  Since then, I haven_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t been able to bring it to the table since he is in my gaming group.  
All pieces are there, but the outside of the lid is beginning to bubble up.  I have noticed this seems to happen with the games made in Germany, but I do not know why.  It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s only artificial at the moment and does not affect the game or the box at all.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  </notes>

    <notes>This game is unplayed all cards are still in their original shrinkwrap.  The game pieces and board are all unused.  The box does have a straight tear on the upper right hand corner that is right along the edge and could be easily taped.  Otherwise this game would rate as new.</notes>

    <notes>999 Games edition, but is language independant. Game is new and still in shrink. However, one of the corners was damaged during shipment but is still intact. This also resulted in some creasing across the bottom of the box. Please see the pictures for the corner damage and creasing.  Of note, the damage does not appear to have been high enough to damage the board.  In addition, the bottom portion of the other three corners appear to have some scrapes.  </notes>

    <notes>999 Games - Union Pacific
Language: Dutch
2 to 6 players
12 year and older
Duration: about 90 min
New - mint condition - unopened - still in shrink wrap.
Weight: 1,340 kg
Theme: Union Pacific is a train-themed stock market game. On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies. There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends. Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds. Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules. Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart. Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.

Buyer pays actual shipping from WA state, it will fit in a flat rate box, so U.S. shipping won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t be more than $10.35.  Please ask any questions before purchase.</notes>

Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart. Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.

Shipping charge will be an estimate of the actual cost of shipping the game to you. That means I can usually reduce shipping charges if you buy more than one of my games -- Send me a message and I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ll calculate the discount.</notes>

    <notes>German version--the instructions in lots of other languages are right here on BGG! (Now that I think of it, was there ever an English version?)
Opened and played once. All parts intact, nothing missing, no bends, scuffs, nothing. Box is perfect. Whole thing looks brand new. No rubber bands on the cards! (Why do I list it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Very Good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;? Because technically, I didn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t just open from shrinkwrap, we did play it once!)
I prefer paypal but check or money order is OK too.
Buyer pays shipping, which I use USPS only. I can only ship to people in the US, sorry. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve no problem at all in telling you how much shipping is going to cost before you buy it!
Thanks for looking!

This is by the same designer as Ticket to Ride and is a nice step up in complexity from that game.  Very easy rules (you won_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t need to refer back to the rulebook much) yet provides depth of play for up to 6 players.</notes>

Components are language independent and I will laser print a copy of the rules in English for you.
The package is approx 3 lbs 12 oz.  I can ship this to you, insured, for $12.50 or less, depending on how far you are from me (Indiana).  The closer you are, Priority Mail is fine, but if you are on a coast, parcel post saves you $3-$4, but will be a little slower.</notes>

    <notes>Union Pacific, Dutch edition from 999 Games.
MINT in shrink.
Components are language independent and I will laser print a copy of the rules in English for you.
The package is approx 3 lbs 12 oz. I can ship this to you, insured, for $12.50 or less, depending on how far you are from me (Indiana). The closer you are, Priority Mail is fine, but if you are on a coast, parcel post saves you $3-$4, but will be a little slower.

The box and components are complete and in excellent condition.  There is no insert (I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m not sure if this game came with an insert or not.) The German rulebook was folded in half at some point.</notes>

    <notes>AMIGO German Edition (1999) with brief English rules included.  Like new components and gameboard. Some rubbing on box-top corners and on box-bottom edges. Very minor _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;wrinkling_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; on box-top, possibly due to humidity. All in all, a very nice way to pick up a copy at a reasonable price!

    <notes>This is the Amigo/Rio Grande English-language version of Union Pacific, and it is in like new condition. The game has been well-cared for, and shows no noticeable wear. It has only been played a few times.  The actual game pieces are all there, and they are in excellent condition, including all of the cards. 
This is a classic Alan Moon board game that has been out-of-print for some time.
This game can be picked up at GenCon Indy 2012 to avoid shipping costs.</notes>

    <notes>THIS GAME HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.
Contents: One copy of Union Pacific, 999 Games Dutch edition. Union Pacific is completely language independent and I will laser print you a nice rule booklet in English.
Condition: New in shrink. THIS GAME HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE, a result of poor packaging when the game was originally sent to me. The best way I can describe it is that there is a small amount of white scuffing on two of the box corners, one small ding on one corner where something hit the box, and one edge ding on the top of the box that mildly creased the top of the box about 8 inches along one edge. I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m making this sound worse than it is because I don_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t want a buyer coming back later and saying that I was untruthful somehow!
Shipping: This game weighs 5 pounds packaged. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s your choice between USPS Priority Mail and USPS Parcel Post (both are insured and delivery confirmed). For this game, I estimate shipping to be around $15 depending on how far you are from Indiana.
Payment: I take Paypal, USPS Money Orders, and Walmart Money Orders.
Just so we are clear, this game is in shrink, and there is a SMALL AMOUNT OF BOX DAMAGE.</notes>
