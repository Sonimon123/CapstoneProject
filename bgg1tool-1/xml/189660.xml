    <notes>Brand new kickstarter funded boardgame, tried it out but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s not really my thing.
Condition is used, but as new.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve sorted the cards using dividers, some card packs still in original wrapping. Includes all the kickstarter exclusives in the first image, and the optional addons I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;ve circled in the second image.
Most of the stuff fits inside the main box as pictured.
Direct bank transfer is an option.
Buyer is responsible for all postage fees, and paypal fees that apply.
I will try to ship using the cheapest method available to me, with tracking and insurance.
Alternatively if anyone lives in Adelaide, you can contact me for a pickup purchase at Largs North 5016</notes>

    <notes>The box was opened, card packs opened, and I played partway through a game by myself to learn how to play after reading the rule book.
The reason I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling is because I bought it as game to play by myself -- the people I play with wouldn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t really be into. Well, it wasn_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;t that great as a solo game, so I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;m selling it. 
This is the Kickstarter edition with all the extra stuff from the base pledge. I paid $15 extra for one add-on, which was the _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;four premium folding lane boards._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; They are nice, but they make the box not quite close. See attached pictures.
I_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to recoup what I paid for it, which was $75. It_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s still in perfect condition, I basically just unwrapped the card packs for you. The cards are pretty well secured in the box so they should travel well. 
The extra card packs have not been opened at all. Very mild shelf wear to box, as in pictures. 
Will ship by FedEx, buyer to pay actual cost. I have a business account there so FedEx is my most affordable option typically.</notes>

    <notes>This is for the full Kickstarter version including the neoprene mat. It also includes the 5-6 player expansion, premium folding player boards,  Forbidden Sciences, Nortec-Elite, and Immolation optional buys. All items will ship in the base game box. I will pay shipping to the USA. Let me know if you also want the Immolation box but that will require a shipping charge due to size.

Dreadmire includes:
- Base game
- All Kickstarter stretch goals (over 125 additional cards, resource playmat)
- All cards still in shrink wrap
- Card storage box to hold all cards
This item can be purchased with my listing of Xenoshyft: Onslaught (https://boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/product/1271536) for a $10 discount overall and to save on shipping. Onslaught includes the following:
- Base game

- Mayday Games Standard 63.5x88mm Card sleeves (all cards are sleeved)
- Card storage box to hold all cards
PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING:
Send me a GeekMail message before you purchase Onslaught, Dreadmire, or both. We will need to figure out various logistics, such as:
- Do you want the insert that the game came with? (I removed the one from the Onslaught box, though I still have it if needed.)
- Do you want both game boxes if purchasing Onslaught and Dreadmire? (Both Onslaught and Dreadmire are stored in the Onslaught box now, though each is separated into individual card storage boxes.)
- Do you want to keep the card sleeves for the Onslaught cards?
- Calculate shipping rates for individual vs. combined purchase
--------
Do you want to buy Dreadmire only (with all Kickstarter stretch goals)? If so, this section applies to you.
