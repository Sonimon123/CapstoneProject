   <description>Each player plays a character who starts the game as a teenager and then must choose the cards that will make his life take shape. He can repeat a school year and get new friends, start smoking, take part in a Bible discussion group and have his first sexual intercourse during Oktoberfest _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; all very realistic. Every event in the life of a character has some effect on his main characteristics - tobacco addiction, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, wealth, health, sadness, spirituality and wisdom. Excess comes at a price, though, and when a characteristic gets too high, it cancels another one _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; if you smoke too much, you get thin; if you get too fat, you must stop drinking; if you drink too much you lose your wisdom, and so on _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ndash; once more, very realistic. During game, you can get friends, and often more, with other player_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s characters. This is an important feature in the game, since what happens to you usually affects, in good or bad, your friends, and this is one of the main interaction aspects of the game._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Description from Bruno Faidutti's ideal game library._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;</description>

    <notes>This is the German version of the game.  Game has been punched but has never been played and is like new, inside and out.  English rules included.  Rio Grande said their version of this game is going to be censored, but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unclear to what extent.  This version of the game might be worth your while.
Continental US shipping will be $7.30 by FedEx Ground. International buyers should contact me for a shipping quote. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions about this game.  Also, check out my other games for sale. Shipping costs will be reduced for multiple items.</notes>

    <notes>FFFF, original German edition with English pasteups on the cards. The pasteups are what I would term serviceable, if not perfect. They do not detract from the game experience, and rather, add to it by making the humour in the cards more evident. The cards also come sleeved, which is necessary to prevent the pasteups from having their corners peel. The price on this item is slightly higher than a new in shrink copy because of the amount of work I had to put in to make this copy an english one.
 You pay true shipping costs, and have the option of either Parcel Post or Priority Mail from the USPS.
Payment options are Paypal (preferred), Cashier_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s Check/Money Order, or cash (at your risk).
I will ship anywhere in the world, the quoted price is only for the Continental United States.
Yes, I combine shipping costs, so be sure to check out the other games I have available!</notes>

FUNNY FRIENDS *MATURE*
What are your life goals? Are you willing to do what it takes to achieve them? In this game, fate select your goals, and changes them arbitrarily, so that after spending much time and effort to become a rock star, for example, fate decides you must now renounce that life and make the necessary life-style changes to become a, for example, a priest. Once you are pious and priestly, fate is likely to find another goal, which requires yet more significant changes in your life. This is a fun and fast-moving game that will leave you exhausted from the laughter and chaos!</notes>

Spellekijn  is a brick _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp; mortar shop located in Leeuwarden, The Netherlands – we are not someone_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s garage or basement.

You are also free to contact us.
International Customers, please ask for your precise shipping costs.
Methods of payment:
• You can always pick the game up in our local shop :-)

This game is actually like-new and played once.. 100% complete from a smoke-free home. The only reason I listed it as _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;good_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot; condition is because one of the corners on the box lid is separated.  The game is otherwise perfect.
  Each player plays a character who starts the game as a teenager and then must choose the cards that will make his life take shape. He can repeat a school year and get new friends, start smoking, take part in a Bible discussion group and have his first sexual intercourse during Oktoberfest – all very realistic/so not rated for all ages!  Every event in the life of a character has some effect on his main characteristics - tobacco addiction, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, wealth, health, sadness, spirituality and wisdom. Excess comes at a price, though, and when a characteristic gets too high, it cancels another one – if you smoke too much, you get thin; if you get too fat, you must stop drinking; if you drink too much you lose your wisdom, and so on – once more, very realistic. During game, you can get friends, and often more, with other player’s characters. This is an important feature in the game, since what happens to you usually affects, in good or bad, your friends, and this is one of the main interaction aspects of the game.</notes>
