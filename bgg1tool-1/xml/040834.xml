   <description>In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;buy_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;From the back of the box: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;Something_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;s afoot. The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rsquo;re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;ldquo;The eggs are on the plate._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;rdquo; You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent. Everything is going according to plan._T_E_M_P_T_A_G_amp;quot;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_lt;br/_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_gt;Dominion: Intrigue adds rules for playing with up to 8 players at two tables or for playing a single game with up to 6 players when combined with Dominion. This game adds 25 new Kingdom cards and a complete set of Treasure and Victory cards.

    <notes>A pristine set of 25 regular (i.e., beige border on back) Kingdom cards from Dominion Intrigue. 
To avoid confusion this set of 25 playable cards (NOT blue border on back randomizer cards) consists of: 1 each of Baron, Bridge, Conspirator, Coppersmith, Courtyard, Duke, Great Hall, Harem, Ironworks, Masquerade, Mining Village, Minion, Nobles, Pawn, Saboteur, Scout, Secret Chamber, Shanty Town, Steward, Swindler, Torturer, Trading Post, Tribute, Upgrade and Wishing Well
This set is intended to be used with the base Dominion set AND the Black Market expansion card by anyone who desires to have a taste of Intrigue mixed into the vanilla version of Dominion. This is an economical way to incorporate Intrigue strategies into basic Dominion.
I accept PayPal and will ship by any method you choose. Cost for shipping will not exceed what I pay.</notes>

    <notes>A pristine set of 25 regular (i.e., beige border on back) Kingdom cards from Dominion Intrigue individually sleeved in clear sleeves AND the Dominion Intrigue instruction booklet which details game-play and contains a very useful description of each card_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s unique ability.
To avoid confusion this set of 25 playable cards (NOT the randomizer cards with blue border on the back) consists of: 1 each of Baron, Bridge, Conspirator, Coppersmith, Courtyard, Duke, Great Hall, Harem, Ironworks, Masquerade, Mining Village, Minion, Nobles, Pawn, Saboteur, Scout, Secret Chamber, Shanty Town, Steward, Swindler, Torturer, Trading Post, Tribute, Upgrade and Wishing Well
This unique set is intended to be used with the base Dominion set AND the Black Market expansion card by anyone who desires to have a taste of Intrigue mixed into the vanilla version of Dominion. This is a well-tested economical way to incorporate Dominion Intrigue strategies into basic Dominion gameplay.
I accept PayPal and will ship by any method you choose. Cost for shipping will NOT exceed what I pay and I do NOT charge a packaging fee.
For inquiring minds... 
Q: _T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;Why are you selling only a one set of cards?_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_quot;
A: The game was damaged by a student in transport to a gaming club. We were only able to salvage a single PERFECT set of the 25 cards and are posting them for sale so that we can (hopefully) afford to buy a new set for the class games library.</notes>

    <notes>Rio Grande Games (RIO390)
You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. Dominion: Intrigue adds rules for playing with up to 8 players at two tables or for playing a single game with up to 6 players. This game adds 25 new Kingdom cards and a complete set of Treasure and Victory cards. The game can be played alone by players experienced in Dominion or with the basic game of Dominion. </notes>

    <notes>NOTE:  THIS OFFER FOR USER userid122002 ONLY!  THANK YOU.
Most cards are in very good condition.  I am selling both this and Dominion (base set) in case you want to save on shipping by purchasing both.  In the base set, the Treasure cards are showing wear around the edges, but they can be replaced with the Treasure cards in Intrigue if you purchase both sets...those are unused.  None of them are damaged...just the black border is beginning to wear away on some of the Treasure cards.  The base game box has shelf wear in all four corners.  I can send you pics if you like.  Otherwise, the condition of both sets are very good.</notes>

    <notes>Played 1-2 times, always sleeved (but sleeves not included, unfortunately).  Cards in perfect condition.
Box has some shelf wear on corners.  Instructions has some curve, but generally lay flat.
I have listed Seaside, Alchemy, Prosperity as well, and if you_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;d like to combine to save on shipping (potentially even ditching the boxes to go with ccg card boxes, as I did when I had them on the shelves), let me know.
Shipping will be exact cost +$0.75 (for shipping materials), even internationally.
Thanks!</notes>

    <notes>THIS GAME SOLD WITH ALONG WITH ITS EXPANSIONS ONLY - see separate listings.
Played heavily, the box shows shelf send travel wear. 98% of cards are sleeved (only some of the money cards which were extra, and a few frequently unused cards which we never played with).
Loved the game but it_T_E_M_P_T_A_G_#039;s time to move on.
I have Dominion, Seaside, Prosperity, Cornicopia, the Black Market promo card included. All have boxes, manuals, and are 98% sleeved with clear sleeves.
Note that these cards are MISSING from the set: The Witch, Young Witch, and Torturer.
This entire set is a good, clean, play set. Enjoy!</notes>
